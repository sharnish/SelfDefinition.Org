							</p>
							<p>
								Welcome to NoFap. If this is your first time visiting, read this page and browse through the information on our off-reddit website <span class="note80">[link above]</span> to gain an understanding on what NoFap is all about. If you're skeptical, you may wish to try our program for just seven days (instead of the usual thirty or ninety). It's just seven days. If you're in control, that should be no sweat, right? After that little sneak peak, decide for yourself if you want to participate in a longer challenge.
							</p>
							<p>
								You set your own goals. We're just here as a supporting service to try and help you along. We're not here to say that that pornography and masturbation are unhealthy or evil. Our users would never agree to a sweeping statement like that. In fact, you're bound to find a range of opinion here. What unites the NoFap community is simply a desire to stop masturbating and/or utilizing pornography -- maybe for a day, maybe for a month or longer -- and our determination to help one another achieve our goals.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Welcome to the ultimate challenge. Good luck!</em>
							</p>
							<br />
							<h3>
								Potential Benefits
							</h3>
							<p>
								The potential benefits listed here are based on the anecdotal reports of NoFap community members. They range from zero to life-changing. Individual results will vary; they are not guaranteed.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><em>Numbed Pleasure Response healing:</em> You may suffer from something called Numbed Pleasure Response (perhaps even Erectile Dysfunction or Delayed Ejaculation), making it harder for you to reach pleasure or climax. Abstaining from pornography and possibly masturbation altogether may help you overcome these problems. </li>
								<li><em>Increased Self-control:</em> If you feel you may be addicted to pornography, or masturbate excessively, there are benefits alone from gaining the self control to control your behavior. </li>
								<li><em>More hard drive space:</em> Some porn collections can take up terabytes of information. Eliminating it will free up hard drive space. </li>
								<li><em>More time:</em> If you're spending hours surfing porn sites looking for that one image to get off, that time can be better spent pursuing your passions, bettering your life, spending time with friends or a significant other, etc. </li>
								<li><em>Improved attitude:</em> Many nofappers describe increased happiness throughout their lives, especially in their attitudes toward sex. </li>
							</ul>
							<h3>
								Choose Your Challenge
							</h3>
							<p>
								Every NoFap challenge is unique. Why are you here? What are your goals? You should review the following options, make some decisions, and document them (either mentally or by posting a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap">reddit.com/r/NoFap</a>) before partaking in the NoFap challenge.
							</p>
							<p>
								No Fapping: The majority of fapstonauts choose to abstain from masturbating to orgasm throughout the duration of their challenges.
							</p>
							<p>
								No Edging: "Fapping" may or may not include "edging," which is physical stimulation without orgasm. Most fapstronauts do not allow it; some do. Your call.
							</p>
							<p>
								No Porn: Most fapstronauts also choose to avoid deliberately viewing pornography. Some choose to allow one or the other (pornography or masturbation), depending on their individual goals. Some fapstronauts are here only to break away from pornography and allow masturbation. Some fapstronauts are here to cut down on their excessive masturbation and choose to allow the viewing of pornography. As previously stated, these decisions are entirely up to you and should be based on your goals.
							</p>
							<p>
								Hard Mode: Choose your difficulty level. It is up to you whether you would like to allow yourself to engage in sexual acts with another person or not. Allowing no outlet for sexual release is dubbed "hard mode".
							</p>
							<p>
								Duration: How long would you like to participate? A week? A month? Ninety days? A year? This is up to you. If you wish to sign up for a monthly tracking competition, find a sign up thread. If sign up threads are closed, feel free to post in the daily tracking threads with your progress anyway.
							</p>
							<p>
								Post in the daily update threads on the NoFap reddit, regardless of which challenge you're participating in! Create a journal thread and update it everyday for added accountability.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sign up for an accountability partner! Establishing a personal connection with someone going through similar struggles is one of the best ways to increase your odds of successfully completing a NoFap challenge.

								Tips
							</h3>
							<p>
								Get a NoFap accountability partner by posting or responding to an ad on our forums. Establishing a personal connection with someone going through similar struggles is one of the best ways to increase your odds of successfully completing a NoFap challenge.
							</p>
							<p>
								If pornographic websites are your problem then it's simple to set up a web filter to block the sites in question. If you have an accountability partner or someone to hold you accountable, Covenant Eyes, in addition to blocking your access to the pornographic content, will email them if you try to access porn. (see <a href="https://www.covenanteyes.com/">www.covenanteyes.com</a>) Covenant Eyes also works for smartphones and is offering NoFap fapstronauts a one month free trial. Just use the coupon code "nofap" while checking out.
							</p>
							<p>
								If accountability is not important to you, K9 is a highly recommended free web blocker. <span class="note">(See k9webprotection.com [broken link], acquired in 2016 by Symantec.)</span> Try giving control of your password away to a trusted friend, or setting up some kind of system that makes it more difficult for you to bypass the filter.
							</p>
							<p>
								Use the Filte.Reddit feature in the Reddit Enhancement Suite to block questionable subreddits. Also, many fapstronauts have migrated over to the NoFap forums <span class="note80">[link above]</span> with the goal of avoiding reddit altogether, since porn is so easily accessible here.
							</p>
							<p>
								Try to do a little bit of exercise each day, this will help use up any excess energy you may gain from not masturbating to internet pornography, as well as provide a distraction.
							</p>
							<p>
								Set yourself a goal and, if you feel necessary, a punishment should you fail.
							</p>
							<p>
								Give yourself rewards for achieving certain mile markers.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Glossary
							</h3>
							<p>
								On top of some general internet acronyms, NoFap users have developed their own culture and vocabulary throughout the last couple of years. A full and frequently updated glossary of NoFap terminology is available on our off-reddit website.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Fapping:</em> The act of masturbation, usually in conjunction with pornography
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>PMO:</em> Porn/Masturbation/Orgasm. They come together like a Happy Meal and the toy.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Edging:</em> Fapping without orgasm.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Reboot:</em> The process of restoring your brain to factory defaults. Said to take about 90 days (+/- 30 days), by anecdotal reports.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Chaser Effect:</em> The super-charged desire to fap that sometimes hits 1-3 days after sexual acts. Especially powerful early on in a reboot
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>ED:</em> Erectile dysfunction
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>PE:</em> Premature ejaculation
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Death Grip:</em> The tight-fisted grip on the penis many men develop by masturbating. Because it is much more constricted than the grip of an actual vagina, the death grip overstimulates the penis, reduces pleasure in the long run, and can make it difficult or impossible to orgasm with a woman. Women have their own version of the death grip, the Death Schlick -- stimulating the clitoris very rapidly and energetically -- which can have the same effects.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The Surge:</em> The period 5-14 days after the start of a streak often features a physically recognizable surge in energy and sexual drive, which seems to be associated with the fapstinence-induced testosterone surge observed in the study listed below.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Flatlining:</em> Many NoFappers report one or more periods of zero libido during their streak, especially in the 2-6 week period. Transitioning from an overexcited, always-eager libido to none at all can be disconcerting and even scary for the experienced fapper, but many fapstronauts report that it is only a phase in the reboot and will pass.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>YMMV:</em> Your Mileage May Vary. Good words to remember, because no two reboots are exactly alike.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Schlicking:</em> Female equivalent of fapping.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Blue Petal:</em> Female equivalent of blue balls.
							</p>
							<br />
							<h3>
								What NoFap Is Not
							</h3>
							<p>
								...a panacea. Do not look to fapstinence to cure your physical, social, or mental ills. If you have other problems that have nothing to do with your sexual habits, they're still going to be there when you're done with a NoFap challenge.
							</p>
							<p>
								...a stealth moral crusade. A clear majority of /r/NoFap, subscribers and moderators alike, agree that there's nothing inherently wrong with masturbation. As one moderator put it, "It's natural. Everyone does it; hell, even monkeys do it. We are just choosing not to for our own reasons. If you keep fapping, that's totally cool -- there's nothing wrong or bad with it." There are religious members who believe otherwise, but they are here in part because /r/NoFap's open-minded approach works better for them than the morally-focused "chastity ministries" that dot the internet.
							</p>
							<p>
								...the same for anyone. Everyone -- everyone -- has a different experience on their fapstinence streaks. Just because your two favorite posters had wet dreams at Day 30 doesn't mean you'll have them before Day 70. Or maybe you'll have three wet dreams on Day 2 and then never again. On top of that, everyone brings his (or her) own life situation and meanings to /r/NoFap. Some have regular sex partners; others are virgins. Some reset whenever they edge; others only count orgasms as failures. Some have ED; some are addicted to pornography; others are here simply for the challenge. The only way to know what /r/NoFap will mean for you is by joining and making your own attempt.
							</p>
							<p>
								...proven science. Sure, we like to think that we have good reason to believe what we do about excessive masturbation and porn use. Our beliefs seem pretty well-founded in reasonable hypotheses based on known information about the brain and addiction, and those hypotheses match many of our own lived experiences. They even seem to be gaining some acceptance in the world of mainstream psychology. And, yeah, we have anecdote after anecdote about people who feel all-around better, or even manage to escape the grip of ED, after a reboot. But, if you're looking for an empirical study documenting the physical and psychological effects of long-term fapstinence, that study simply doesn't exist. Like many other diets and personal health and wellness plans, the scientific establishment has not yet had the opportunity to study us in detail. We firmly hope that one day -- hopefully soon -- it will. Then we'll be able to see more clearly whether what we do here amounts to anything more than the placebo effect. Until then, we're flying by the seat of our pants, and you join us at your own risk.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Frequently Asked Questions
							</h3>
							<p>
								I edged/watched porn/touched my genitals. Do I have to reset my badge? Many fapstronauts reset their badges if they masturbate to orgasm. However, others use stricter criteria and reset even if they just "edged" or watched pornography without masturbation. Every challenge is unique and you should set these conditions, based on your individual goals, prior to starting your NoFap challenge.
							</p>
							<p>
								I had a wet dream. Do I have to reset my badge? The general consensus is that wet dreams do not require a badge reset. Nocturnal emissions ("wet dreams") are natural occurrences and are not masturbation. There's nothing you can do about wet dreams; it's just your body dealing with accumulated sexual tension.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm a guy and I have spontaneous emissions. Is this normal? If something out of the ordinary happens, please consult with a medical professional. However, many guys experienced either wet dreams or spontaneous emissions after abstaining from orgasm for a period of time. Some of these guys report that this emissions occur less frequently as your body adjusts.
							</p>
							<p>
								Should I engage in sexual activity during the reboot? Again, this is entirely up to you and your individual goals. Fapstronaut opinions vary. Some people say that the reboot is about training your brain to see sex as an activity you do with a real-world partner. Hence, having sex with a real person will be beneficial. Others argue that the purpose of the reboot is to calm down the overheated dopamine pathways and that any orgasms, even those experienced with a partner, will interfere with this process. If you decide to have sex during the reboot, be aware of the chaser effect, which may give you a strong urge to fap or watch porn the day after having sex. If you have a stable long-term partner, you could try to replace regular sex with karezza during your reboot. (see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/karezza">www.reddit.com/r/karezza</a>) With karezza, you have sex but avoid orgasms, and you emphasize bonding behaviors (such as cuddling) over passionate sex. Either way, you shouldn't worry too much about having sex during the reboot. Even if you were planning on not having sex or not having orgasms, and it happens, don't beat yourself up over it. Give yourself a high-five and carry on. Ultimately, the goal here is to develop a healthy relationship to sex with real people.
							</p>
							<p>
								Are you guys against masturbation? &nbsp;&nbsp;No.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Events
							</h3>
							<p>
								Every month we hold No Fap Challenges. If you are looking to abstain from porn or masturbation for a different period of time (for example, one week or our "90 day reboot"), post your own thread and then post in the daily update threads.
