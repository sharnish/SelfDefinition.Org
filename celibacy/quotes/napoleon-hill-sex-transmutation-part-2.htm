							<p>
								I discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men who succeed in an outstanding way, seldom do so before the age of forty, and more often they do not strike their real pace until they are well beyond the age of ﬁfty. This fact was so astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause most carefully, carrying the investigation over a period of more than twelve years.
							</p>
							<p>
								This study disclosed the fact that the major reason why the majority of men who succeed do not begin to do so before the age of forty to ﬁfty, is their tendency to DISSIPATE their energies through over indulgence in physical expression of the emotion of sex. The majority of men never learn that the urge of sex has other possibilities, which far transcend in importance, that of mere physical expression. The majority of those who make this discovery, do so after having wasted many years at a period when the sex energy is at its height, prior to the age of forty-ﬁve to ﬁfty. This usually is followed by noteworthy achievement.
							</p>
							<p>
								The lives of many men up to, and sometimes well past the age of forty, reﬂect a continued dissipation of energies, which could have been more proﬁtably turned into better channels. Their ﬁner and more powerful emotions are sown wildly to the four winds. Out of this habit of the male, grew the term, "sowing his wild oats."
							</p>
							<p>
								The desire for sexual expression is by far the strongest and most impelling of all the human emotions, and for this very reason this desire, when harnessed and transmuted into action, other than that of physical expression, may raise one to the status of a genius.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of America’s most able business men frankly admitted that his attractive secretary was responsible for most of the plans he created. He admitted that her presence lifted him to heights of creative imagination, such as he could experience under no other stimulus.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the most successful men in America owes most of his success to the inﬂuence of a very charming young woman, who has served as his source of inspiration for more than twelve years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Everyone knows the man to whom this reference is made, but not everyone knows the REAL SOURCE of his achievements.
							</p>
							<p>
								History is not lacking in examples of men who attained to the status of genii, as the result of the use of artiﬁcial mind stimulants in the form of alcohol and narcotics. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the "Raven" while under the inﬂuence of liquor, "dreaming dreams that mortal never dared to dream before." James Whitcomb Riley did his best writing while under the inﬂuence of alcohol. Perhaps it was thus he saw "the ordered intermingling of the real and the dream, the mill above the river, and the mist above the stream." Robert Burns wrote best when intoxicated, "For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, we’ll take a cup of kindness yet, for Auld Lang Syne." But let it be remembered that many such men have destroyed themselves in the end. Nature has prepared her own potions with which men may safely stimulate their minds so they vibrate on a plane that enables them to tune in to ﬁne and rare thoughts which come from-no man knows where! No satisfactory substitute for Nature’s stimulants has ever been found.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is a fact well known to psychologists that there is a very close relationship between sex desires and spiritual urges-a fact which accounts for the peculiar behavior of people who participate in the orgies known as religious "revivals," common among the primitive types.
							</p>
							<p>
								The world is ruled, and the destiny of civilization is established, by the human emotions. People are inﬂuenced in their actions, not by reason so much as by "feelings." The creative faculty of the mind is set into action entirely by emotions, and not by cold reason. The most powerful of all human emotions is that of sex. There are other mind stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no one of them, nor all of them combined, can equal the driving power of sex.
							</p>
							<p>
								A mind stimulant is any inﬂuence which will either temporarily, or permanently, increase the vibrations of thought. The ten major stimulants, described, are those most commonly resorted to.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through these sources one may commune with Inﬁnite Intelligence, or enter, at will, the storehouse of the subconscious mind, either one’s own, or that of another person, a procedure which is all there is of genius.
							</p>
							<p>
								A teacher, who has trained and directed the efforts of more than 30,000 sales people, made the astounding discovery that highly sexed men are the most efﬁcient salesmen. The explanation is, that the factor of personality known as "personal magnetism" is nothing more nor less than sex energy. Highly sexed people always have a plentiful supply of magnetism. Through cultivation and understanding, this vital force may be drawn upon and used to great advantage in the relationships between people. This energy may be communicated to others through the following media:
							</p>
							<p>
								1. The hand-shake. The touch of the hand indicates, instantly, the presence of magnetism, or the lack of it.
							</p>
							<p>
								2. The tone of voice. Magnetism, or sex energy, is the factor with which the voice may be colored, or made musical and charming.
							</p>
							<p>
								3. Posture and carriage of the body. Highly sexed people move briskly, and with grace and ease.
							</p>
							<p>
								4. The vibrations of thought. Highly sexed people mix the emotion of sex with their thoughts, or may do so at will, and in that way, may inﬂuence those around them.
							</p>
							<p>
								5. Body adornment. People who are highly sexed are usually very careful about their personal appearance. They usually select clothing of a style becoming to their personality, physique, complexion, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								When employing salesmen, the more capable sales manager looks for the quality of personal magnetism as the ﬁrst requirement of a salesman. People who lack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire others with enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is one of the most important requisites in salesmanship, no matter what one is selling.
							</p>
							<p>
								The public speaker, orator, preacher, lawyer, or salesman who is lacking in sex energy is a "ﬂop," as far as being able to inﬂuence others is concerned. Couple with this the fact, that most people can be inﬂuenced only through an appeal to their emotions, and you will understand the importance of sex energy as a part of the salesman’s native ability. Master salesmen attain the status of mastery in selling, because they, either consciously, or unconsciously, transmute the energy of sex into SALES ENTHUSIASM! In this statement may be found a very practical suggestion as to the actual meaning of sex transmutation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The salesman who knows how to take his mind off the subject of sex, and direct it in sales effort with as much enthusiasm and determination as he would apply to its original purpose, has acquired the art of sex transmutation, whether he knows it or not.
							</p>
							<p>
								The majority of salesmen who transmute their sex energy do so without being in the least aware of what they are doing, or how they are doing it.
							</p>
							<p class="note center">
								<a href="#get-full-book">Get the full book here.</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Transmutation of sex energy calls for more will power than the average person cares to use for this purpose. Those who ﬁnd it difﬁcult to summon will-power sufﬁcient for transmutation, may gradually acquire this ability. Though this requires will-power, the reward for the practice is more than worth the effort. The entire subject of sex is one with which the majority of people appear to be unpardonably ignorant. The urge of sex has been grossly misunderstood, slandered, and burlesqued by the ignorant and the evil minded, for so long that the very word sex is seldom used in polite society. Men and women who are known to be blessed-yes, BLESSED-with highly sexed natures, are usually looked upon as being people who will bear watching. Instead of being called blessed, they are usually called cursed.
							</p>
							<p>
								Millions of people, even in this age of enlightenment, have inferiority complexes which they developed because of this false belief that a highly sexed nature is a curse. These statements, of the virtue of sex energy, should not be construed as justiﬁcation for the libertine. The emotion of sex is a virtue ONLY when used intelligently, and with discrimination. It may be misused, and often is, to such an extent that it debases, instead of enriches, both body and mind. The better use of this power is the burden of this chapter.
							</p>
							<p>
								It seemed quite signiﬁcant to the author, when he made the discovery that practically every great leader, whom he had the privilege of analyzing, was a man whose achievements were largely inspired by a woman. In many instances, the "woman in the case" was a modest, self-denying wife, of whom the public had heard but little or nothing. In a few instances, the source of inspiration has been traced to the "other woman." Perhaps such cases may not be entirely unknown to you.
							</p>
							<p>
								Intemperance in sex habits is just as detrimental as intemperance in habits of drinking and eating. In this age in which we live, an age which began with the world war, intemperance in habits of sex is common. This orgy of indulgence may account for the shortage of great leaders. No man can avail himself of the forces of his creative imagination, while dissipating them. Man is the only creature on earth which violates Nature’s purpose in this connection. Every other animal indulges its sex nature in moderation, and with purpose which harmonizes with the laws of nature. Every other animal responds to the call of sex only in "season." Man’s inclination is to declare "open season."
							</p>
							<p>
								Every intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through alcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys the vital organs of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however, that over indulgence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as detrimental to creative effort as narcotics or liquor.
							</p>
							<p>
								A sex-mad man is not essentially different than a dope-mad man! Both have lost control over their faculties of reason and will-power. Sexual overindulgence may not only destroy reason and will-power, but it may also lead to either temporary, or permanent insanity. Many cases of hypochondria (imaginary illness) grow out of habits developed in ignorance of the true function of sex.
							</p>
							<p>
								From these brief references to the subject, it may be readily seen that ignorance on the subject of sex transmutation, forces stupendous penalties upon the ignorant on the one hand, and withholds from them equally stupendous beneﬁts, on the other.
							</p>
							<p>
								Widespread ignorance on the subject of sex is due to the fact that the subject has been surrounded with mystery and beclouded by dark silence. The conspiracy of mystery and silence has had the same effect upon the minds of young people that the psychology of prohibition had. The result has been increased curiosity, and desire to acquire more knowledge on this "verboten" subject; and to the shame of all lawmakers, and most physicians-by training best qualiﬁed to educate youth on that subject-information has not been easily available.
							</p>
							<p>
								Seldom does an individual enter upon highly creative effort in any ﬁeld of endeavor before the age of forty. The average man reaches the period of his greatest capacity to create between forty and sixty. These statements are based upon analysis of thousands of men and women who have been carefully observed. They should be encouraging to those who fail to arrive before the age of forty, and to those who become frightened at the approach of "old age," around the fortyyear mark. The years between forty and ﬁfty are, as a rule, the most fruitful. Man should approach this age, not with fear and trembling, but with hope and eager anticipation.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you want evidence that most men do not begin to do their best work before the age of forty, study the records of the most successful men known to the American people, and you will ﬁnd it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Henry Ford had not "hit his pace" of achievement until he had passed the age of forty. Andrew Carnegie was well past forty before he began to reap the reward of his efforts.
							</p>
							<p>
								James J. Hill was still running a telegraph key at the age of forty. His stupendous achievements took place after that age. Biographies of American industrialists and ﬁnanciers are ﬁlled with evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age of man. Between the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn (if he ever learns), the art of sex transmutation. This discovery is generally accidental, and more often than otherwise, the man who makes it is totally unconscious of his discovery. He may observe that his powers of achievement have increased around the age of thirty-ﬁve to forty, but in most cases, he is not familiar with the cause of this change; that Nature begins to harmonize the emotions of love and sex in the individual, between the ages of thirty and forty, so that he may draw upon these great forces, and apply them jointly as stimuli to action.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sex, alone, is a mighty urge to action, but its forces are like a cyclone-they are often uncontrollable. When the emotion of love begins to mix itself with the emotion of sex, the result is calmness of purpose, poise, accuracy of judgment, and balance. What person, who has attained to the age of forty, is so unfortunate as to be unable to analyze these statements, and to corroborate them by his own experience?
							</p>
							<p>
								When driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the emotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is, capable of great achievement, but his actions may be disorganized, distorted, and totally destructive. When driven by his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may steal, cheat, and even commit murder. But when the emotion of LOVE is mixed with the emotion of sex, that same man will guide his actions with more sanity, balance, and reason.
							</p>
							<p>
								Criminologists have discovered that the most hardened criminals can be reformed through the inﬂuence of a woman’s love. There is no record of a criminal having been reformed solely through the sex inﬂuence. These facts are well known, but their cause is not. Reformation comes, if at all, through the heart, or the emotional side of man, not through his head, or reasoning side.
							</p>
							<p>
								Reformation means, "a change of heart." It does not mean a "change of head." A man may, because of reason, make certain changes in his personal conduct to avoid the consequences of undesirable effects, but GENUINE REFORMATION comes only through a change of heart-through a DESIRE to change. Love, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to heights of super achievement. Love is the emotion which serves as a safety valve, and insures balance, poise, and constructive effort. When combined, these three emotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius. There are genii, however, who know but little of the emotion of love. Most of them may be found engaged in some form of action which is destructive, or at least, not based upon justice and fairness toward others. If good taste would permit, a dozen genii could be named in the ﬁeld of industry and ﬁnance, who ride ruthlessly over the rights of their fellow men. They seem totally lacking in conscience. The reader can easily supply his own list of such men.
							</p>
							<p>
								The emotions are states of mind. Nature has provided man with a "chemistry of the mind" which operates in a manner similar to the principles of chemistry of matter. It is a well known fact that, through the aid of chemistry of matter, a chemist may create a deadly poison by mixing certain elements, none of which are-in themselves-harmful in the right proportions. The emotions may, likewise, be combined so as to create a deadly poison. The emotions of sex and jealousy, when mixed, may turn a person into an insane beast.
							</p>
							<p class="note center">
								<a href="#get-full-book">Get the full book here.</a>
							<p>
								The presence of any one or more of the destructive emotions in the human mind, through the chemistry of the mind, sets up a poison which may destroy one’s sense of justice and fairness. In extreme cases, the presence of any combination of these emotions in the mind may destroy one’s reason.
							</p>
							<p>
								The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex, love, and romance. Brieﬂy, the process may be stated as follows:
							</p>
							<p>
								Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in one’s mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it. Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any emotion, and encourage the presence of any other. Control of the mind, through the power of will, is not difﬁcult. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any negative emotion presents itself in one’s mind, it can be transmuted into a positive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one’s thoughts.
							</p>
							<p>
								THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH VOLUNTARY SELF EFFORT!
							</p>
							<p>
								A man may attain to great heights of ﬁnancial or business achievement, solely by the driving force of sex energy, but history is ﬁlled with evidence that he may, and usually does, carry with him certain traits of character which rob him of the ability to either hold, or enjoy his fortune. This is worthy of analysis, thought, and meditation, for it states a truth, the knowledge of which may be helpful to women as well as men. Ignorance of this has cost thousands of people their privilege of HAPPINESS, even though they possessed riches.
							</p>
							<p>
								The emotions of love and sex leave their unmistakable marks upon the features. Moreover, these signs are so visible, that all who wish may read them. The man who is driven by the storm of passion, based upon sex desires alone, plainly advertises that fact to the entire world, by the expression of his eyes, and the lines of his face. The emotion of love, when mixed with the emotion of sex, softens, modiﬁes, and beautiﬁes the facial expression. No character analyst is needed to tell you this - you may observe it for yourself.
							</p>
							<p>
								The emotion of love brings out, and develops, the artistic and the aesthetic nature of man. It leaves its impress upon one’s very soul, even after the ﬁre has been subdued by time and circumstance.
							</p>
							<p>
								Memories of love never pass. They linger, guide, and inﬂuence long after the source of stimulation has faded. There is nothing new in this. Every person, who has been moved by GENUINE LOVE, knows that it leaves enduring traces upon the human heart. The effect of love endures, because love is spiritual in nature. The man who cannot be stimulated to great heights of achievement by love, is hopeless-he is dead, though he may seem to live.
							</p>
							<p>
								Even the memories of love are sufﬁcient to lift one to a higher plane of creative effort. The major force of love may spend itself and pass away, like a ﬁre which has burned itself out, but it leaves behind indelible marks as evidence that it passed that way. Its departure often prepares the human heart for a still greater love. Go back into your yesterdays, at times, and bathe your mind in the beautiful memories of past love. It will soften the inﬂuence of the present worries and annoyances. It will give you a source of escape from the unpleasant realities of life, and maybe-who knows?-your mind will yield to you, during this temporary retreat into the world of fantasy, ideas, or plans which may change the entire ﬁnancial or spiritual status of your life.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have "loved and lost," perish the thought. One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely. Love is whimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It comes when it pleases, and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it remains, but spend no time worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring it back.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dismiss, also, the thought that love never comes but once. Love may come and go, times without number, but there are no two love experiences which affect one in just the same way. There may be, and there usually is, one love experience which leaves a deeper imprint on the heart than all the others, but all love experiences are beneﬁcial, except to the person who becomes resentful and cynical when love makes its departure.
							</p>
							<p>
								There should be no disappointment over love, and there would be none if people understood the difference between the emotions of love and sex. The major difference is that love is spiritual, while sex is biological. No experience, which touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can possibly be harmful, except through ignorance, or jealousy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Love is, without question, life’s greatest experience. It brings one into communion with Inﬁnite Intelligence. When mixed with the emotions of romance and sex, it may lead one far up the ladder of creative effort. The emotions of love, sex, and romance, are sides of the eternal triangle of achievement-building genius. Nature creates genii through no other force.
							</p>
							<p>
								Love is an emotion with many sides, shades, and colors. The love which one feels for parents, or children is quite different from that which one feels for one’s sweetheart. The one is mixed with the emotion of sex, while the other is not.
							</p>
							<p>
								The love which one feels in true friendship is not the same as that felt for one’s sweetheart, parents, or children, but it, too, is a form of love.
							</p>
							<p>
								Then, there is the emotion of love for things inanimate, such as the love of Nature’s handiwork. But the most intense and burning of all these various kinds of love, is that experienced in the blending of the emotions of love and sex. Marriages, not blessed with the eternal afﬁnity of love, properly balanced and proportioned, with sex, cannot be happy ones-and seldom endure. Love, alone, will not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two beautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind, closest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the obstructions between the ﬁnite mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence are removed.
							</p>
							<p>
								Then a genius has been born! What a different story is this, than those usually associated with the emotion of sex. Here is an interpretation of the emotion which lifts it out of the commonplace, and makes of it potter’s clay in the hands of God, from which He fashions all that is beautiful and inspiring. It is an interpretation which would, when properly understood, bring harmony out of the chaos which exists in too many marriages. The disharmonies often expressed in the form of nagging, may usually be traced to lack of knowledge on the subject of sex. Where love, romance and the proper understanding of the emotion and function of sex abide, there is no disharmony between married people.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fortunate is the husband whose wife understands the true relationship between the emotions of love, sex, and romance. When motivated by this holy triumvirate, no form of labor is burdensome, because even the most lowly form of effort takes on the nature of a labor of love.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is a very old saying that "a man’s wife may either make him or break him," but the reason is not always understood. The "making" and "breaking" is the result of the wife’s understanding, or lack of understanding of the emotions of love, sex, and romance. Despite the fact that men are polygamous, by the very nature of their biological inheritance, it is true that no woman has as great an inﬂuence on a man as his wife, unless he is married to a woman totally unsuited to his nature. If a woman permits her husband to lose interest in her, and become more interested in other women, it is usually because of her ignorance, or indifference toward the subjects of sex, love, and romance. This statement presupposes, of course, that genuine love once existed between a man and his wife.
							</p>
							<p>
								The facts are equally applicable to a man who permits his wife’s interest in him to die. Married people often bicker over a multitude of trivialities. If these are analyzed accurately, the real cause of the trouble will often be found to be indifference, or ignorance on these subjects. Man’s greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman! The hunter who excelled during prehistoric days, before the dawn of civilization, did so, because of his desire to appear great in the eyes of woman. Man’s nature has not changed in this respect. The "hunter" of today brings home no skins of wild animals, but he indicates his desire for her favor by supplying ﬁne clothes, motor cars, and wealth. Man has the same desire to please woman that he had before the dawn of civilization. The only thing that has changed, is his method of pleasing. Men who accumulate large fortunes, and attain to great heights of power and fame, do so, mainly, to satisfy their desire to please women.
							</p>
							<p>
								Take women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most men. It is this inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to make or break a man.
							</p>
							<p>
								The woman who understands man’s nature and tactfully caters to it, need have no fear of competition from other women. Men may be "giants" with indomitable will-power when dealing with other men, but they are easily managed by the women of their choice.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most men will not admit that they are easily inﬂuenced by the women they prefer, because it is in the nature of the male to want to be recognized as the stronger of the species. Moreover, the intelligent woman recognizes this "manly trait" and very wisely makes no issue of it. Some men know that they are being inﬂuenced by the women of their choice-their wives, sweethearts, mothers or sisters-but they tactfully refrain from rebelling against the inﬂuence because they are intelligent enough to know that NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN. The man who does not recognize this important truth deprives himself of the power which has done more to help men achieve success than all other forces combined.

									<strong>Napoleon Hill</strong> was born in 1883 in a one-room cabin in Virginia. He began his writing career at age 13 as a "mountain reporter" for small town newspapers and went on to become America’s most beloved motivational author. Hill passed away in November 1970 after a long and successful career writing, teaching, and lecturing about the principles of success. His work stands as a monument to individual achievement and is the cornerstone of modern motivation. His book <em>Think and Grow Rich</em> is the all time bestseller in the field.
