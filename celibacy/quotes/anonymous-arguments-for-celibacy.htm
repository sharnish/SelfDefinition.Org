                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sex is how we all got here, so it’s pointless to denigrate or deny it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, most animals reproduce in season while humans have sex year round, so there are other factors at work.
                            </p>
                            <ol class="generic">
                                <li>Keeping couples together.</li>
                                <li>Recreation, "pleasure".</li>

                                As an approach to sanity, it is proposed to examine these other factors, in order to allow for the best health and well being of the individual while ensuring propagation of the species.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The natural order of things would be:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="generic">
                                <li>Opposite sexes attract. </li>
                                <li>They reproduce. </li>
                                <li>They stay together and raise children. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                This can be examined in contrast to deviations from this condition: in other words, pathology, such as with promiscuous behavior.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (Keep in mind that there could be genetic reasons in the species for promiscuity, i.e., a tendency to increase the diversity of the gene pool.)</p>
                            <p>
                                Non-reproductive sex such as promiscuous behavior and masturbation can be seen as unhealthy by the sense of dissatisfaction they engender. If at first these feelings of unhappiness are rationalized away as being the result of social programming (internalized self-criticism) the activity may persist until the dissatisfaction becomes unbearable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This suggests some tentative axioms:
                            </p>
                            <p class="italic">
                                A.) Man has a drive toward fulfilling a purpose, and actions which are counter to accomplishing that purpose result in unhappiness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Different people define their purpose differently: work, family, acquisition of knowledge, spirituality. Balance in life means each of these are included, as well as a break from the routine known as recreation. An unbalanced life results in the drive to purpose being blocked.
                            </p>
                            <p class="italic">
                                B.) The human body is an energy system designed to enable man to fulfill his purpose.
                            </p>
                            <ul class="generic">
                                <li>Disruption of the energy system results in illness. </li>

                                <li>Extreme pain and illness can cause depression and hopelessness, sometimes a wish for death. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                It must be considered that there could be natural forces - which when they occur to the physical body are called diseases - that seek to exploit man's energy and push him to despair.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Energy conservation is both a cause and an effect of good health.

                            <ul class="generic">
                                <li>Subject to confusion: i.e., conflicting thoughts, theories and plans; subconscious thoughts, repressed traumatic memories; constantly shifting frame of reference. </li>
                                <li>Subject to division - man is multiple, without will. </li>
                                <li>Subject to influence - society, images, voices (internal and external). </li>
                                <li>Subject to ignorance - about his body, actions and purpose.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                When we use the word "weakness" we mean that we have conflicting desires and we pay a price when one of them gets out of hand. Then in remorse we say we are weak; we couldn't achieve our aim, we lost our integrity, our word is no good.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note the presence of negative forces (thoughts and emotions) which oppress when we believe we have "failed". These forces did not wish for us to succeed in the first place, so why should we respect them?</p>

                                How is celibacy accomplished, in theory and practice?</h4>
                            <ul class="generic">
                                <li>Normally there is a period of exhaustion; then a wish for self-preservation against excess.</li>
                                <li>It is seen that the misuse of time, energy and attention can be harmful to one's spiritual prospects.</li>
                                <li>The above is a clue, to redirect one's spiritual efforts, however defined, replacing sex with positive efforts.</li>
                                <li>Simultaneously, the positive effects of celibacy on one's physical and mental states are noted, with a desire to keep body and mind healthy. Sex can be replaced by walking, exercise, etc. </li>
                                <li>Association with like-minded individuals is always helpful.</li>
                                <li>Likewise, avoiding people who have antagonistic views regarding one's own aims or who are energy drains.</li>
                                <li>Strong negative emotions sucher as anger and rage feed off sexual energy, so they should be avoided.</li>
                                <li>Mental celibacy is crucial, avoiding images and associations.</li>
                                <li>Avoid the temptation to look with lust at other people.</li>
                                <li>Be wary that a period of abstinence will make you more attractive in the eyes of the opposite sex; also your new-found confidence may make you less worried about your weaknesses.</li>
                                <li>If in a relationship, at the minimum stay true to your partner.</li>
                            </ul>

                                A Classic Experiment</h4>
                            <p>
                                Richard Rose said to approach celibacy as a scientific experiment, rather than a question of morality and taboo. The following is the classic experiment he offered:
                            </p>
                            <ol class="generic">
                                <li>Read a spiritual book when one has not been celibate.</li>
                                <li>Be celibate for 30 days.</li>
                                <li>Re-read the same book and guage the improvement in your scope and depth of understanding.</li>
                                <li>Note the improvement in your mental clarity, energy level, and physical health.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                If you try this, the subject will no longer be theoretical for you; you will have the certainty of knowing from your own experience. This is something that 95% of people would never try. Look for a better way of life than the 95%.
