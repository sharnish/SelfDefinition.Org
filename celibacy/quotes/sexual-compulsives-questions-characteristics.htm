                                            While constantly seeking intimacy with another person, we found that the desperate quality of our need made true intimacy with anyone impossible, and we often <a href="https://scanneronline.org/archives/summer2000/index.html#12">developed unhealthy dependency relationships</a> that eventually became unbearable.

                                            Even when we got the love of another person, it <a href="https://scanneronline.org/archives/summer2000/index.html#13">never seemed enough</a>, and we were unable to stop lusting after others.

                                    If we decide that we have the disease of sexual compulsion, the first step toward recovery is to admit that we are powerless over our condition and that it makes our lives unmanageable. When we can do so, we are ready to move on to the 12-step recovery program. The only requirement for membership in SCA is a desire to stop our compulsive sexual behavior.</p>
