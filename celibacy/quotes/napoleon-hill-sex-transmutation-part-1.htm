								The meaning of the word "transmute" is, in simple language, "the changing, or transferring of one element, or form of energy, into another."
							</p>
							<p>
								The emotion of sex brings into being a state of mind. Because of ignorance on the subject, this state of mind is generally associated with the physical, and because of improper inﬂuences, to which most people have been subjected, in acquiring knowledge of sex, things essentially physical have highly biased the mind. The emotion of sex has back of it the possibility of three constructive potentialities, they are:
							</p>
							<p>
								1. The perpetuation of mankind.
							</p>
							<p>
								2. The maintenance of health, (as a therapeutic agency, it has no equal).
							</p>
							<p>
								3. The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching of the mind from thoughts of physical expression, to thoughts of some other nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them at other times. So strong and impelling is the desire for sexual contact that men freely run the risk of life and reputation to indulge it. When harnessed, and redirected along other lines, this motivating force maintains all of its attributes of keenness of imagination, courage, etc., which may be used as powerful creative forces in literature, art, or in any other profession or calling, including, of course, the accumulation of riches.
							</p>
							<p>
								The transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of will-power, to be sure, but the reward is worth the effort. The desire for sexual expression is inborn and natural. The desire cannot, and should not be submerged or eliminated. But it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body, mind, and spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation, it will seek outlets through purely physical channels.
							</p>
							<p>
								A river may be dammed, and its water controlled for a time, but eventually, it will force an outlet. The same is true of the emotion of sex. It may be submerged and controlled for a time, but its very nature causes it to be ever seeking means of expression. If it is not transmuted into some creative effort it will ﬁnd a less worthy outlet.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fortunate, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex emotion an outlet through some form of creative effort, for he has, by that discovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius.
							</p>
							<p>
								Scientiﬁc research has disclosed these signiﬁcant facts:
							</p>
							<p>
								1. The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex natures; men who have learned the art of sex transmutation.
							</p>
							<p>
								2. The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved outstanding recognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the professions, were motivated by the inﬂuence of a woman.
							</p>
							<p>
								The research from which these astounding discoveries were made, went back through the pages of biography and history for more than two thousand years. Wherever there was evidence available in connection with the lives of men and women of great achievement, it indicated most convincingly that they possessed highly developed sex natures.
							</p>
							<p>
								The emotion of sex is an "irresistible force," against which there can be no such opposition as an "immovable body." When driven by this emotion, men become gifted with a super power for action. Understand this truth, and you will catch the signiﬁcance of the statement that sex transmutation will lift one to the status of a genius.
							</p>
							<p>
								The emotion of sex contains the secret of creative ability. Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed the major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to any animal after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it has been altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all the FIGHT that was in him. Sex alteration of the female has the same effect.

							<h2>
								THE TEN MIND STIMULI
							</h2>
							<p>
								The human mind responds to stimuli, through which it may be "keyed up" to high rates of vibration, known as enthusiasm, creative imagination, intense desire, etc. The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:
							</p>
							<p>
								1. The desire for sex expression
							</p>
							<p>
								2. Love
							</p>
							<p>
								3. A burning desire for fame, power, or ﬁnancial gain, MONEY
							</p>
							<p>
								4. Music
							</p>
							<p>
								5. Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the opposite sex.
							</p>
							<p>
								6. A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement.
							</p>
							<p>
								7. Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted.
							</p>
							<p>
								8. Auto-suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								9. Fear
							</p>
							<p>
								10. Narcotics and alcohol.
							</p>
							<p>
								The desire for sex expression comes at the head of the list of stimuli, which most effectively "stepup" the vibrations of the mind and start the "wheels" of physical action. Eight of these stimuli are natural and constructive. Two are destructive. The list is here presented for the purpose of enabling you to make a comparative study of the major sources of mind stimulation. From this study, it will be readily seen that the emotion of sex is, by great odds, the most intense and powerful of all mind stimuli.
							</p>
							<p>
								This comparison is necessary as a foundation for proof of the statement that transmutation of sex energy may lift one to the status of a genius. Let us ﬁnd out what constitutes a genius. Some wiseacre has said that a genius is a man who "wears long hair, eats queer food, lives alone, and serves as a target for the joke makers." A better deﬁnition of a genius is, "a man who has discovered how to increase the vibrations of thought to the point where he can freely communicate with sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought."
							</p>
							<p>
								The person who thinks will want to ask some questions concerning this deﬁnition of genius. The ﬁrst question will be, "How may one communicate with sources of knowledge which are not available through the ORDINARY rate of vibration of thought?"
							</p>
							<p>
								The next question will be, "Are there known sources of knowledge which are available only to genii, and if so, WHAT ARE THESE SOURCES, and exactly how may they be reached?" We shall offer proof of the soundness of some of the more important statements made in this book-or at least we shall offer evidence through which you may secure your own proof through experimentation, and in doing so, we shall answer both of these questions.
							</p>
							<p>
								"GENIUS" IS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE SIXTH SENSE
							</p>
							<p>
								The reality of a "sixth sense" has been fairly well established. This sixth sense is "Creative Imagination." The faculty of creative imagination is one which the majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if used at all, it usually happens by mere accident. A relatively small number of people use, WITH DELIBERATION AND PURPOSE AFORETHOUGHT, the faculty of creative imagination. Those who use this faculty voluntarily, and with understanding of its functions, are GENII.
							</p>
							<p>
								The faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the ﬁnite mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence. All so-called revelations, referred to in the realm of religion, and all discoveries of basic or new principles in the ﬁeld of invention, take place through the faculty of creative imagination.
							</p>
							<p>
								When ideas or concepts ﬂash into one’s mind, through what is popularly called a "hunch," they come from one or more of the following sources:
							</p>
							<p>
								1. Inﬁnite Intelligence
							</p>
							<p>
								2. One’s subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense impression and thought impulse which ever reached the brain through any of the ﬁve senses
							</p>
							<p>
								3. From the mind of some other person who has just released the thought, or picture of the idea or concept, through conscious thought, or
							</p>
							<p>
								4. From the other person’s subconscious storehouse. There are no other KNOWN sources from which "inspired" ideas or "hunches" may be received.
							</p>
							<p>
								The creative imagination functions best when the mind is vibrating (due to some form of mind stimulation) at an exceedingly high rate. That is, when the mind is functioning at a rate of vibration higher than that of ordinary, normal thought.
							</p>
							<p>
								When brain action has been stimulated, through one or more of the ten mind stimulants, it has the effect of lifting the individual far above the horizon of ordinary thought, and permits him to envision distance, scope, and quality of THOUGHTS not available on the lower plane, such as that occupied while one is engaged in the solution of the problems of business and professional routine.
							</p>
							<p>
								When lifted to this higher level of thought, through any form of mind stimulation, an individual occupies, relatively, the same position as one who has ascended in an airplane to a height from which he may see over and beyond the horizon line which limits his vision, while on the ground. Moreover, while on this higher level of thought, the individual is not hampered or bound by any of the stimuli which circumscribe and limit his vision while wrestling with the problems of gaining the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. He is in a world of thought in which the ORDINARY, work-a-day thoughts have been as effectively removed as are the hills and valleys and other limitations of physical vision, when he rises in an airplane.
							</p>
							<p>
								While on this exalted plane of THOUGHT, the creative faculty of the mind is given freedom for action. The way has been cleared for the sixth sense to function, it becomes receptive to ideas which could not reach the individual under any other circumstances. The "sixth sense" is the faculty which marks the difference between a genius and an ordinary individual.
							</p>
							<p>
								The creative faculty becomes more alert and receptive to vibrations, originating outside the individual’s subconscious mind, the more this faculty is used, and the more the individual relies upon it, and makes demands upon it for thought impulses. This faculty can be cultivated and developed only through use. That which is known as ones `conscience operates entirely through the faculty of the sixth sense. The great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great, because they acquire the habit of relying upon the "still small voice" which speaks from within, through the faculty of creative imagination. It is a fact well known to people who have "keen" imaginations that their best ideas come through socalled "hunches."
							</p>
							<p>
								There is a great orator who does not attain to greatness, until he closes his eyes and begins to rely entirely upon the faculty of Creative Imagination. When asked why he closed his eyes just before the climaxes of his oratory, he replied, "I do it, because, then I speak through ideas which come to me from within."
							</p>
							<p>
								One of America’s most successful and best known ﬁnanciers followed the habit of closing his eyes for two or three minutes before making a decision.
							</p>
							<p>
								When asked why he did this, he replied, "With my eyes closed, I am able to draw upon a source of superior intelligence."
							</p>
							<p>
								The late Dr. Elmer R. Gates, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, created more than 200 useful patents, many of them basic, through the process of cultivating and using the creative faculty. His method is both signiﬁcant and interesting to one interested in attaining to the status of genius, in which category Dr. Gates, unquestionably belonged. Dr. Gates was one of the really great, though less publicized scientists of the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								In his laboratory, he had what he called his "personal communication room." It was practically sound proof, and so arranged that all light could be shut out. It was equipped with a small table, on which he kept a pad of writing paper. In front of the table, on the wall, was an electric pushbutton, which controlled the lights. When Dr. Gates desired to draw upon the forces available to him through his Creative Imagination, he would go into this room, seat himself at the table, shut off the lights, and CONCENTRATE upon the KNOWN factors of the invention on which he was working, remaining in that position until ideas began to "ﬂash" into his mind in connection with the UNKNOWN factors of the invention.
							</p>
							<p>
								On one occasion, ideas came through so fast that he was forced to write for almost three hours. When the thoughts stopped ﬂowing, and he examined his notes, he found they contained a minute description of principles which bad not a parallel among the known data of the scientiﬁc world.
							</p>
							<p>
								Moreover, the answer to his problem was intelligently presented in those notes. In this manner Dr. Gates completed over 200 patents, which had been begun, but not completed, by "half-baked" brains. Evidence of the truth of this statement is in the United States Patent Ofﬁce.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Gates earned his living by "sitting for ideas" for individuals and corporations. Some of the largest corporations in America paid him substantial fees, by the hour, for "sitting for ideas."
							</p>
							<p class="note center">
								<a href="#get-full-book">Get the full book here.</a>
							<p>
								The reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by one’s accumulated experience. Not all knowledge, which one accumulates through "experience," is accurate. Ideas received through the creative faculty are much more reliable, for the reason that they come from sources more reliable than any which are available to the reasoning faculty of the mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								The major difference between the genius and the ordinary "crank" inventor, may be found in the fact that the genius works through his faculty of creative imagination, while the "crank" knows nothing of this faculty. The scientiﬁc inventor (such as Mr. Edison, and Dr. Gates), makes use of both the synthetic and the creative faculties of imagination.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, the scientiﬁc inventor, or "genius, begins an invention by organizing and combining the known ideas, or principles accumulated through experience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning faculty). If he ﬁnds this accumulated knowledge to be insufﬁcient for the completion of his invention, he then draws upon the sources of knowledge available to him through his creative faculty. The method by which he does this varies with the individual, but this is the sum and substance of his procedure:
							</p>
							<p>
								1. HE STIMULATES HIS MIND SO THAT IT VIBRATES ON A HIGHER-THANAVERAGE PLANE, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or some other stimulant of his choice.
							</p>
							<p>
								2. HE CONCENTRATES upon the known factors (the ﬁnished part) of his invention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the unﬁnished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL thought, and waits for his answer to "ﬂash" into his mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sometimes the results are both deﬁnite and immediate. At other times, the results are negative, depending upon the state of development of the "sixth sense," or creative faculty. Mr. Edison tried out more than 10,000 different combinations of ideas through the synthetic faculty of his imagination before he "tuned in" through the creative faculty, and got the answer which perfected the incandescent light. His experience was similar when he produced the talking machine.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is plenty of reliable evidence that the faculty of creative imagination exists. This evidence is available through accurate analysis of men who have become leaders in their respective callings, without having had extensive educations. Lincoln was a notable example of a great leader who achieved greatness, through the discovery, and use of his faculty of creative imagination. He discovered, and began to use this faculty as the result of the stimulation of love which he experienced after he met Anne Rutledge, a statement of the highest signiﬁcance, in connection with the study of the source of genius.
							</p>
							<p>
								The pages of history are ﬁlled with the records of great leaders whose achievements may be traced directly to the inﬂuence of women who aroused the creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire. Napoleon Bonaparte was one of these.
							</p>
							<p>
								When inspired by his ﬁrst wife, Josephine, he was irresistible and invincible. When his "better judgment" or reasoning faculty prompted him to put Josephine aside, he began to decline. His defeat and St. Helena were not far distant.
							</p>
							<p>
								If good taste would permit, we might easily mention scores of men, well known to the American people, who climbed to great heights of achievement under the stimulating inﬂuence of their wives, only to drop back to destruction AFTER money and power went to their heads, and they put aside the old wife for a new one.
							</p>
							<p>
								Napoleon was not the only man to discover that sex inﬂuence, from the right source, is more powerful than any substitute of expediency, which may be created by mere reason.
							</p>
							<p>
								The human mind responds to stimulation! Among the greatest, and most powerful of these stimuli is the urge of sex. When harnessed and transmuted, this driving force is capable of lifting men into that higher sphere of thought which enables them to master the sources of worry and petty annoyance which beset their pathway on the lower plane.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unfortunately, only the genii have made the discovery. Others have accepted the experience of sex urge, without discovering one of its major potentialities-a fact which accounts for the great number of "others" as compared to the limited number of genii.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the purpose of refreshing the memory, in connection with the facts available from the biographies of certain men, we here present the names of a few men of outstanding achievement, each of whom was known to have been of a highly sexed nature. The genius which was their’s, undoubtedly found its source of power in transmuted sex energy:
							</p>
							<ul class="generic-no-bullet">
								<li>GEORGE WASHINGTON </li>
								<li>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE </li>
								<li>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE </li>
								<li>ABRAHAM LINCOLN </li>
								<li>RALPH WALDO EMERSON </li>
								<li>ROBERT BURNS </li>
								<li>THOMAS JEFFERSON </li>
								<li>ELBERT HUBBARD </li>
								<li>ELBERT H. GARY </li>
								<li>OSCAR WILDE</li>
								<li>WOODROW WILSON </li>
								<li>JOHN H. PATTERSON </li>
								<li>ANDREW JACKSON </li>
								<li>ENRICO CARUSO</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="tiny">
								[add Nicola Tesla]</p>
							<p>
								Your own knowledge of biography will enable you to add to this list. Find, if you can, a single man, in all history of civilization, who achieved outstanding success in any calling, who was not driven by a well developed sex nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you do not wish to rely upon biographies of men not now living, take inventory of those whom you know to be men of great achievement, and see if you can ﬁnd one among them who is not highly sexed. Sex energy is the creative energy of all genii. There never has been, and never will be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this driving force of sex.
							</p>
							<p>
								Surely no one will misunderstand these statements to mean that ALL who are highly sexed are genii! Man attains to the status of a genius ONLY when, and IF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces available, through the creative faculty of the imagination. Chief among the stimuli with which this "stepping up" of the vibrations may be produced is sex energy. The mere possession of this energy is not sufﬁcient to produce a genius. The energy must be transmuted from desire for physical contact, into some other form of desire and action, before it will lift one to the status of a genius.
							</p>
							<p>
								Far from becoming genii, because of great sex desires, the majority of men lower themselves, through misunderstanding and misuse of this great force, to the status of the lower animals.

									<strong>Napoleon Hill</strong> was born in 1883 in a one-room cabin in Virginia. He began his writing career at age 13 as a "mountain reporter" for small town newspapers and went on to become America’s most beloved motivational author. Hill passed away in November 1970 after a long and successful career writing, teaching, and lecturing about the principles of success. His work stands as a monument to individual achievement and is the cornerstone of modern motivation. His book <em>Think and Grow Rich</em> is the all time bestseller in the field.
