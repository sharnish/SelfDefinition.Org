								'How wise and grand, how far-seeing and morally beneficent are the laws of Manu* on connubial life, when compared with the licence tacitly allowed to man in civilized countries. That those laws have been neglected for the last two millenniums does not prevent us from admiring their forethought. The Brahmin was a grihasta, a family man, till a certain period of his life, when, after begetting a son, he broke with married life and became a chaste Yogi. His connubial life was regulated by his Brahmin astrologer in accordance with his nature. Therefore, in such countries as the Punjab, for instance, where the lethal influence of Mussulman, and later on of European, licentiousness, has hardly touched the orthodox Aryan castes, one still finds the finest men -- so far as stature and physical strength go -- on the whole globe; whereas the mighty men of old have found themselves replaced in the Deccan, and especially in Bengal, by men whose generation becomes with every century (and almost with every year) dwarfed and weakened.'</p>

								THKO. My dear sir, I cannot go into physiological questions with you; but I can give you an obvious and, I think, a sufficient answer ... Can a man serve two masters? No! Then it is equally impossible for him to divide his attention between the pursuit of Occultism and a wife. If he tries to, he will assuredly fail in doing either properly; and, let me remind you, practical Occultism is far too serious and dangerous a study for a man to take up, unless he is in the most deadly earnest, and ready to sacrifice all, himself first of all, to gain his end.</p>

								* A <a href="comments-by-esoteric-student.htm">contributor</a> writes: This is accomplished by maintaining celibacy during pregnacy, which creates a pure environment for the developing fetus; cultivating innocence and a pure environment for the growing infant and child; and giving positive direction for his developing abilities. Richard Rose is supportive evidence for this quote: his mother was celibate while pregnant, because his father was sent to the penitentiary for killing a man who called her a 'slut' while she was walking to church. She also held a long vigil on the statehouse steps every day protesting her husband's imprisonment, asking for his release - so her mind was occupied during pregnancy with a spiritual aspiration - that of loyalty, and the will to do something about it.

								From <em>The Mahatma Letters</em> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Letters">[Wikipedia]</a></sup> - unnatural living promotes disease and misery:</p>
							<p>
								'[Man's] mission and destiny in the economy of nature is to die his natural death brought by old age; save accident, neither a savage nor a wild (free) animal die of disease. Food, sexual relations, drink, are all natural necessities of life; yet excess in them brings on disease, misery, suffering, mental and physical, and the latter are transmitted as the greatest evils to future generations, the progeny of the culprits. Ambition, the desire of securing happiness and comfort for those we love, by obtaining honours and riches, are praiseworthy natural feelings but when they transform man into an ambitious cruel tyrant, a miser, a selfish egotist they bring untold misery on those around him; on nations as well as on individuals. All this then -- food, wealth, ambition, and a thousand other things we have to leave unmentioned -- becomes the source and cause of evil whether in its abundance or through its absence. Become a glutton, a debauchee, a tyrant, and you become the originator of diseases, of human suffering and misery. Lack all this and you starve, you are despised as a <em>nobody</em> and the majority of the herd, your fellow men, make of you a sufferer your whole life. Therefore it is neither nature nor an imaginary Deity that has to be blamed, but human nature made vile by <em>selfishness. </em>'

								'There are different conditions and orders prescribed in the Shastras.

This is the highest of the four; in which the members of either of the other three may enter, the necessary conditions for it being the renunciation of all worldly considerations. Following are the four different successive stages of this life: (a) <em>Kutichaka </em>- living in a hut, or in a desolate place and wearing a red-ochre coloured garment, carrying a three-knotted bamboo rod, and wearing the hair in the centre of the crown of the head, having the sacred thread, and devoting oneself to the contemplation of <em>Parabrahma</em>; (b) <em>Bahudaka </em>- one who lives quite apart from his family and the world, maintains himself on alms collected at seven houses, and wears the same kind of reddish garment; (c) <em>Hansa </em>- the same as in the preceding case, except the carrying of only a one-knotted bamboo; (d) <em>Paramahansa </em>- the same as the others; but the ascetic wears the sacred thread, and his hair and beard are quite long.

							</p>
							<p>
								'... The above letter raises certain important questions. Some enquire how the world is to go on if all were to become occultists, one of the vital conditions of that order being celibacy. Others say that the ancient Rishis married, quoting some of the names mentioned in the Hindu religious books; and argue therefrom that celibacy is not an essential condition for progress in <em>practical </em>occultism. Generally, they put a literal interpretation upon what is beautifully conveyed by means of an allegory and insist upon the dead-letter sense being correct, whenever such a course is profitable in their narrow interests. They find it difficult to control the lower animal desires; and, in order to justify their conduct of persistence in hankering after sensual pleasures, they resort to these books as their authority, interpreting them in a manner most convenient to themselves.
							</p>
							<p>
								Of course, when any passages, even in their exoteric sense, conflict with the dictates of their 'lower self,' then others are quoted, which <em>esoterically </em>convey the same sense, although <em>exoterically </em>supporting their peculiar views. The question of the marriage of the <em>Rishis </em>is one of such disputed points. The readers of <em>The Theosophist</em> may recall here, with advantage, a passage occurring in the article under the heading of 'Magicon,' where one of the occultists is said to have rejected the hand of a beautiful young lady, on the ground of his having taken the vow of celibacy, although he himself confesses further on to be courting a virgin whose name was 'Sophia.' Now, it is explained there that 'Sophia' is wisdom or the <em>Buddhi </em>- the spiritual soul (our sixth principle). This principle is everywhere represented as a 'female,' because it is passive inasmuch as it is merely the vehicle of the seventh principle. This latter - which is called <em>Atma </em>when spoken of in connection with an individual and <em>Purush </em>when applied in its relation to the Universe - is the active male, for it is the CENTRE OF ENERGY acting through and upon its female vehicle, the sixth principle.'</p>

								Blavatky responds a writer 'Aleph', saying he has misconceptions, and that married life is not prohibited by the Indian scriptures:
							</p>
							<p>
								'... India has never condescended to preach the God-misfortune, nor <em>asceticism </em>as understood by 'Aleph'. This is proven by the law of Manu which enjoins marriage to the <em>Grihastha </em>Brahmana, before he becomes an ascetic Brahmana. The greatest misfortune for a Brahmana is not to have a son, and marriage is obligatory barring the exceptional cases when the child is destined to become a <em>Brahmacharin</em>, a Yogi celibate, for occult reasons which cannot be enumerated here. Esotericism has never proscribed sexual or marital functions created by nature herself. Esotericism works <em>in, with, for </em>nature, and condemns but immorality, abuse and excess. Moreover, of all the animals, man is the most animal in his excesses; the beast has its seasons, but man has none.
							</p>
							<p>
								''Aleph' probably speaks of Christian ascetics, those who plunge themselves into exoteric asceticism, a blessed rosary in their hands and the dogmas of the church in their heads. The Hindu becomes an ascetic only after having sufficiently studied the occult sciences to allow his spiritual nature to control his material nature.
							</p>
							<p class="maroon remarks">
								She goes on to say that those who indulge in occult practices without being chaste create incubi and succubi:
							</p>
							<p>
								'Aleph' surely confuses the ascetics of India with the Spiritualistic mediums of Europe-America. The latter, poor sensitives and neurotics, ignore the esoteric laws, and it is they who end by creating incubi and succubi - as is proven by the discarnate wives of certain mediums in Paris itself.'</p>

								"The mental state in which self is known implies, like every other mental act, a perceiving subject and a perceived object. If then the object perceived is self, what is the subject that perceives? or if it is the true self which thinks, what other self can it be that is thought of?* Clearly a true cognition of self implies a self in which the knowing and the known are one--in which subject and object are one; and this Mr. Mansel rightly holds to be the annihilation of both! So that the personality of which each is conscious, and of which the existence is to each a fact beyond all others the most certain, is yet a thing which cannot truly be known at all; the knowledge of it is forbidden by the very nature of thought."</p>

								'... Sophia [Divine Wisdom] descends as a 'bride to the Adepts, from the higher regions of spirit, the astral Ninons de l'Enclos, from Kamaloka, to hysterical epileptics. The less one has to do with the latter class - the better. Let 'sensitives' talk as poetically as they like, the naked truth is that such unnatural <em>sexual </em>unions, between the living man and the beauteous beings of the Elemental world, arise from the abnormal surexcitation of the nervous system and animal passions, through the unclean imagination of the 'sensitive.' In the Kabalistic world, these 'celestial' brides and bridegrooms have always been called by the harsh names of Succubi and Incubi; and the difference between those creatures and the 'Sympneumatas' shown in Laurence Oliphant's <em>Scientific Religion </em>is only a supposed one, and exists for no one except the author. There are some such unions between mediums and their 'controls' - we have known several such personally - and some involuntarily submitted to, under obsession. The tie is a psycho-physiological one, and can be broken by an exercise of will-power, either by the victim or a friendly mesmeriser. Colonel Olcott cured two such cases - one in America, the other in Ceylon. Amiable hysteriacs and certain religious ecstatics may give free run to their diseased fancy, and construct Sophias, Lillies, and other 'Sympneumatas' out of the opalescent aura of their brains; but all the same they are but unconscious sorcerers: they enjoy lustful animal feelings by <em>working black magic upon </em>themselves. If they admit that these unnatural unions, or rather hysterical hallucinations of such are <em>disease</em>, then they are on a level with insane nymphomaniacs; if they deny it, then, accepting responsibility, they place themselves on a far lower level.'</p>

								Spiritual vs. physical relationships:
							</p>
							<p>
								'In Egypt, in days of old, the marriage service contained an article that the woman should be the 'lady of the lord,' and real lord over him, the husband pledging himself to be 'obedient to his wife' for the production of alchemical results such as the elixir of life and the philosopher's stone, for the <em>spiritual</em> help of the woman was needed by the male alchemist. But woe to the alchemist who should take this in the dead-letter sense of <em>physical</em> union. Such sacrilege would become black magic and be followed by certain failure. The true alchemist of old took <em>aged</em> women to help him, carefully avoiding the young ones; and if any of them happened to be married they treated their wives for months both before and during <em>operations </em>as sisters.'</p>

								From <em>Thoughts on the Elementals</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								' It has been said elsewhere, that white magic differed very little from practices of sorcery except in <em>effects </em>and results - good or bad motive being everything. Many of the preliminary rules and conditions to enter societies of <em>adepts</em>, whether of the <em>Right </em>or the <em>Left </em>Path, are also identical in many things. Thus Gabalis says to the author: 'The <em>Sages </em>will never admit you into their society if you do not renounce from this very present a Thing which cannot stand in competition with Wisdom. <em>You must renounce all carnal Commerce with Women</em>.'
							</p>
							<p>
								'This is <em>sine qua non </em>with practical Occultists - Rosicrucians or Yogis, Europeans or Asiatics. But it is also one with the <em>Dugpas </em>and <em>Jadoos </em>of Bhutan and India, one with the <em>Voodoos </em>and <em>Nagals </em>of New Orleans and Mexico,* <em>with an additional clause to it, however, in the statutes of the latter</em>, and this is to have carnal commerce with male and Female Jinns, Elementals or Demons, call them by whatever names you will.**</p>
							<p>
								* We speak here of the well-known <em>ancient statutes </em>in the Sorcery of the Asiatics as in the Demonology of Europe. The Witch had to renounce her husband, the Wizard his marital rights over his legitimate human wife, as the Dugpa renounces to this day commerce with living women; and, as the New Orleans <em>Voodoo </em>does, when in the exercise <em>of his powers</em>. Every Kabalist knows this.'

								<strong>On the struggle between man's higher and lower natures:</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								'.....the divine Titan is moved by altruism, but the mortal man by Selfishness and Egoism in every instance.
							</p>
							<p>
								'The modern Prometheus has now become Epimetheus, 'he who sees only after the event'; because the universal philanthropy of the former has long ago degenerated into selfishness and self-adoration.* Man will rebecome the free Titan of old, but not before cyclic evolution has re-established the broken harmony between the two natures -- the terrestrial and the divine; after which he becomes impermeable to the lower titanic forces, invulnerable in his personality, and immortal in his individuality, which cannot happen before every animal element is eliminated from his nature. When man understands that 'Deus non fecit mortem' (Sap. I., 13)**, but that man has created it himself, he will re-become the Prometheus before his Fall.

								<strong>As do Jacob Boehme and Paracelsus, Blavatsky says that "purity" is the basis for spiritual dvelopment.</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								'[Theosophy] placed personal purity on a level which barred out nine-tenths of these claimants from all thought of their presumed inheritance, and showed that such a condition of purity, far transcending any popular ideal of such virtue, was the absolute and all-essential basis of spiritual insight and attainment.
