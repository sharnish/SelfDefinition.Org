								<strong>Question: </strong>Are there particular stages in the spiritual life when
								celibacy becomes especially important or even essential?
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Swamiji: </strong>Yes and no. From one point of view, celibacy forms the very
								foundation, and the foundation is not any later stage of a constructive process. It is
								the very first stage, the ABC stage. So we may say that it is not at <em>some</em> stage
								that it becomes important or indispensable, but that it is essential right from the very
								beginning.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Question:</strong> If you wanted to call it a stage, then it means you’d call it
								the stage where you start taking the spiritual life seriously.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Swamiji: </strong>Yes, seriously—when you say it and you <em>mean</em> what you
								say. If your aspiration is to be authentic and genuine, and if the aspiration is to take
								the form of an all-out commitment towards the spiritual experience and an all-out effort
								to move in that direction, then you must keep moving only in that direction. You cannot
								run after two things. Because then it will be taking one step forward and one step
								backwards, and you will never really progress.
							</p>
							<p>
								The spiritual life starts with your recognition that as long as you keep going headlong
								in the pursuit of sense satisfaction and pleasure, you are not going to move one step.
								So all will be academic and theoretical. Our aspiration, our wanting spiritual life will
								only be in theory—a fancy and a feeling. You have not started. So the beginning stage
								itself of the spiritual life is a turning away from sense experience and sense
								indulgence and starting to move in the opposite direction.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is perhaps precisely for this reason that Maharshi Patanjali put
								<em>brahmacharya</em> right at the very commencement of his eight-stage Raja Yoga and
								not at any later stage. It is one of the five vows that constitute the first stage. If
								he had thought that it was only important or essential at a later stage, he would have
								brought it in at the third or fourth stage. But no, he did it at the very beginning.
							</p>
							<p>
								Swami Sivananda used to say: &quot;<em>Brahmacharya</em> is the basis of
								immortality.&quot; And in many places in the Upanishads it says: &quot;Wisdom experience
								cannot come to one who has not his senses under restraint and who has not controlled the
								vagaries of his wandering mind.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								So I believe that it is not at <em>some</em> stage, but it is the <em>all</em> of the
								life spiritual. Because spiritual life is a transcendence of your human nature, human
								consciousness. And if it is a transcendence, you have to leave behind all that
								constitutes your human nature, your physicality. You will have to commence with it and
								keep on with it. You view celibacy in a positive manner, not as something anti-nature.
								You do not at all feel that you are doing any violence to yourself.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, from a purely scientific and technical point of view, one of the <em>yogas</em>
								where celibacy is absolutely essential and indispensable is <em>kundalini yoga.</em>
								There is no compromise with that. Right from the beginning it is absolutely essential
								and indispensable. Otherwise it is dangerous to go into <em>kundalini yoga</em> which is
								based upon <em>pranayama</em> and many <em>mudras, bandhas</em> and <em>asanas</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								That’s the &quot;no&quot; part of the answer.
							</p>
							<p>
								The &quot;yes&quot; part is to state that in the total context of spiritual life in
								India, there are certain stages and states where one can be highly spiritual and yet at
								the same time be leading a normal sex life. That is true especially in the
								<em>bhakti</em> path—people who are following the path of love of God, devotion, prayer
								and worship, chanting the Divine Name, singing His glories. This path does not make any
								distinction between a celibate <em>brahmachari,</em> a married householder, and a
								retired couple living a spiritually oriented life after they have finished their duties
								as householders.
							</p>
							<p>
								So the path of devotion seems to be a dimension of spiritual life in India where total
								celibacy in its sense of absolute abstinence is not insisted upon. It is not looked upon
								with disfavour, but it is not insisted upon either. But because the sexual act consumes
								a great amount of <em>pranic</em> energy, naturally self-restraint is also important.
								And promiscuous sex was never countenanced, never looked upon with favour. So a sort of
								celibacy in the form of self-control and fidelity in your sexual relationship with your
								recognised legal partner can also be regarded as <em>brahmacharya.</em> Here, the
								husband looks upon all other women as mothers. He has only one woman and that is his
								lawfully wedded wife. He is what is called an <em>eka-patni-vrata</em> husband, one who
								has taken the vow of a single wife. There is no question of having a mistress or of even
								thinking of another woman. And the wife bases her life on the vow of
								<em>pati-vrata</em>. In a total sense, she has only one partner in life. All other men
								are like her children; she has the feeling of motherhood in her heart towards all other
								men except her husband. So here the sex life does not in any way go contrary to
								spiritual life.
							</p>
							<p>
								And this has been the case with ever so many devotees, lovers of God, and spiritual
								India lacks no example of them. Throughout India we have seen the phenomenon of large
								communities of ecstatic devotees of God, many or most of whom have been married people,
								living a normal sex life, but nevertheless absorbed in divine love of God. So, this is
								the &quot;yes&quot; portion. In this stage sexuality seems not in any way forbidden or
								incompatible with spiritual life.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Question: </strong>I presume that Vedantic enquiry, the more intellectual
								approach to the spiritual life, would also not be incompatible with normal married life.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Swamiji: </strong>Yes, yes. But in the Vedantic type of life, gradually,
								unconsciously, without even intending it on purpose, in the course of time the person
								would graduate to that level of consciousness where sex would begin to seem superfluous.
								Because it contradicts the very basic thesis of Vedanta: &quot;I am not this body. I am
								not the five elements. I am not the limiting adjuncts. I am something quite distinct and
								different.&quot; And for that different, distinct Thing, sex has no meaning. For, It is
								not within the realm of physical consciousness and physical functioning.

							<h4>
								The West
							</h4>
							<p>
								<strong>Question:</strong> Celibacy is often seen in the modern West as an outmoded, old-fashioned practice. It is often viewed as repressive, life-denying—even antithetical to what spiritual practice is ultimately all about. Many spiritual authorities in the West are now teaching that to realise our full potential as human beings, we must embrace, rather than in any way avoid or repress, our sexuality. These views stand in stark contrast to what the great traditions have always taught. What do you think about this?
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Swamiji: </strong>I don’t agree with the general attitude that has just been
								expressed. They have failed to grasp the place of <em>brahmacharya</em> in the spiritual
								life.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is not outmoded; it is not at all old-fashioned, and it is not repressive or
								life-denying. On the contrary, it is used as a plank for everlasting life, endless life.
								Their view of life seems to be a very, very limited and narrow view of life. This is not
								the only life there is. When you come to have a little glimpse or idea of what real life
								is, then you will just stand amazed. This present life as such is meaningless. It is a
								petty trifle, a nothing, if not understood in terms of its being a take-off runway for
								catapulting into that greater life.
							</p>
							<p>
								This life is a means to that great, glorious, grand end and aim of human existence which
								is to enter into a life that is the life of God, that is one with God’s life, the
								Kingdom of Heaven. That is the whole purpose of human existence. Human life has been
								given to us as a passageway to Divinity, as a passageway to everlasting life.
							</p>
							<p>
								No person with a little religious knowledge and awareness or a spiritual view will ever
								deny the validity of <em>brahmacharya.</em> It is something scientific and a scientific
								thing never gets outmoded or old-fashioned. <em>Brahmacharya</em> is neither avoiding
								sexuality nor repressing sexuality. It is giving the go-by to sexuality so that the
								potential and the power of the sexual process can now be used for something so wonderful
								that sex pales into insignificance in contrast.
							</p>
							<p>
								So <em>brahmacharya</em> is neither repressing sexuality nor avoiding sexuality. It is
								just bypassing sexuality—making use of this sexual potential for something ten times, a
								hundred times greater. Therefore, the question of repression and suppression is a
								misnomer. It is due to a lack of proper understanding of what the real spiritual quest
								is. If it is understood, then these terms will not be used. We are not just human
								beings; we are more than human beings. Our human status is only a pale reflection of
								what we really are. The only reason our human status acquires some meaning and
								significance is because if it is properly utilised, it can raise us up and take us into
								that which is our own, bring us into the Kingdom—to which we have a birthright.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you want to understand the practice of celibacy through an analogy that is within the
								thought forms of today, consider an athlete whose great ambition is to win a gold medal
								at the Olympics. He will willingly put himself into the hands of a trainer, and if the
								trainer says, &quot;No more late night revelry, no more sex, no more junk food, no more
								alcohol,&quot; the athlete readily agrees. He says: &quot;I’ll agree to this and more
								also if you want it.&quot; Why? Because he wants the gold medal. And no one raises an
								eyebrow, no one is outraged. Why? Because the gold medal justifies all these so-called
								&quot;inhibitions.&quot; You cannot say that he’ s doing violence to or repressing
								himself, because he is not looking at it that way. He is willing to do anything that the
								trainer demands of him. It is not imposed upon him by other people. We understand why he
								is doing it and we accept it.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, in one way the idea in the West that <em>brahmacharya</em>is suppression is not
								entirely off the mark. If one represses or suppresses some inherent natural force or
								faculty, it can bring about undesirable changes in the personality. If
								<em>brahmacharya</em> is forced upon an individual against the individual’s inclination
								and will, abnormal conditions naturally may result, because the person is being
								compelled to do something that deep within himself or herself the person does not want
								to do—compelled by others, by social restraint or by taking up vows that he or she ought
								not to have taken before having well considered exactly what it implied.
							</p>
							<p>
								But if an intelligent person, having deeply pondered the whole basis of life, says:
								&quot;When I want to achieve something great, something mighty, I cannot afford to
								deplete the energies that I have. The more I conserve, the more I can divert into that
								achievement and the greater the chance of succeeding.&quot; So thinking and having
								understood the rationale of it and fully appreciating the ultimate achievement it would
								lead to, if he or she voluntarily, willingly and with great enthusiasm undertakes
								celibacy, where comes the question of suppression?
							</p>
							<p>
								On the contrary, what appears to be a sort of denial is actually giving full
								self-expression to a higher dimension of your being into which you have now placed
								yourself. So, far from denying self-expression, it is giving full expression to yourself
								because you are no longer identified with the lesser aspect of your total personality.
								You are identified with the higher aspect. It is a sort of a liberation and evolution to
								a higher level. It is something positive, creative, and not anything negative. It is not
								a denial but an actual expression of yourself in the form of a keen aspiration and a
								noble ambition.
							</p>
							<p>
								When it constitutes such a process, then Freud and the others are off the mark. They
								have never visualised such a situation, such a possibility. But it is not only a
								possibility, it is a tradition of centuries, of millennia—someone being prepared to do
								anything, give anything, pay any price for the attainment of the Highest.
