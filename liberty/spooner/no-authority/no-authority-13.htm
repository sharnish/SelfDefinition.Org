                            <p>On general principles of law and reason, the oaths which foreigners take, on coming here, and being &quot;naturalized&quot; (as it is called), are of no validity. They are necessarily given to nobody; because there is no open, authentic association, to which they <em>can</em> join themselves; or to whom, as individuals, they <em>can</em> pledge their faith. No such association, or organization, as &quot;the people of the United States,&quot; having ever been formed by any open, written, authentic, or voluntary contract, there is, on general principles of law and reason, no such association, or organization, in existence. And all oaths that purport to be given to such an association are necessarily given only to the winds. They cannot be said to be given to any man, or body of men, as individuals, because no man, or body of men, can come forward <em>with any proof</em> that the oaths were given to them, as individuals, or to any association of which they are members. To say that there is a tacit understanding among a portion of the male adults of the country, that they will call themselves &quot;the people of the United States,&quot; and that they will act in concert in subjecting the remainder of the people of the United States to their dominion; but that they will keep themselves personally concealed by doing all their acts secretly, is wholly insufficient, on general principles of law and reason, to prove the existence of any such association, or organization, as &quot;the people of the United States;&quot; or consequently to prove that the oaths of foreigners were given to any such association.</p>
