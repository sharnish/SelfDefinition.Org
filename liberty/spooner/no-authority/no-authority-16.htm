These so-called ambassadors, secretaries, presidents, and senators, who claim to be the agents of &quot;the people of the United States,&quot; for making these treaties, can show no open, written, or other authentic evidence that either the whole &quot;people of the United States,&quot; or any other open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever authorized these pretended ambassadors and others to make treaties in the name of, or binding upon any one of, &quot;the people of the United States.&quot; Neither can they show any open, written, or other authentic evidence that either the whole &quot;people of the United States,&quot; or any other open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever authorized these pretended ambassadors, secretaries, and others, in their name and behalf, to recognize certain other persons, calling themselves emperors, kings, queens, and the like, as the rightful rulers, sovereigns, masters, or representatives of the different peoples whom they assume to govern, to represent, and to bind.</p>
                            <p>The &quot;nations,&quot; as they are called, with whom our pretended ambassadors, secretaries, presidents and senators profess to make treaties, are as much myths as our own. On general principles of law and reason, there are no such &quot;nations.&quot; That is to say, neither the whole people of England, for example, nor any open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever, by any open, written, or other authentic contract with each other, formed themselves into any <em>bona fide,</em> legitimate association or organization, or authorized any king, queen, or other representative to make treaties in their name, or to bind them, either individually, or as an association, by such treaties.</p>
                            <p>Our pretended treaties, then, being made with no legitimate or <em>bona fide</em> nations, or representatives of nations, and being made, on our part, by persons who have no legitimate authority to act for us, have intrinsically no more validity than a pretended treaty made by the Man in the Moon with the king of the Pleiades.</p>
