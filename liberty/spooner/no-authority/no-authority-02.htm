                            <p>Let us consider these two matters, voting and tax paying, separately. And first of voting.</p>
                            <p>All the voting that has ever taken place under the Constitution, has been of such a kind that it not only did not pledge the whole people to support the Constitution, but it did not even pledge any one of them to do so, as the following considerations show.</p>
                            <p><span>1.</span> In the very nature of things, the act of voting could bind nobody but the actual voters. But owing to the property qualifications required, it is probable that, during the first twenty or thirty years under the Constitution, not more than one tenth, fifteenth, or perhaps twentieth of the whole population (black and white, men, women, and minors) were permitted to vote. Consequently, so far as voting was concerned, not more than one tenth, fifteenth, or twentieth of those then existing, could have incurred any obligation to support the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>At the present time, it is probable that not more than one sixth of the whole population are <em>permitted</em> to vote. Consequently, so far as voting is concerned, the other five-sixths can have given no pledge that they will support the Constitution.</p>
                            <p><span>2.</span> Of the one-sixth that are <em>permitted</em> to vote, probably not more than two-thirds (about one-ninth of the whole population) have <em>usually</em> voted. Many never vote at all. Many vote only once in two, three, five, or ten years, in periods of great excitement.</p>
                            <p>No one, by voting, can be said to pledge himself for any longer period than that for which he votes. If, for example, I vote for an officer who is to hold his office for only a year, I cannot be said to have thereby pledged myself to support the government beyond that term. Therefore, on the ground of actual voting, it probably cannot be said that more than one-ninth, or one-eighth, of the whole population are <em>usually</em> under any pledge to support the Constitution.</p>
                            <p><span>3.</span> It cannot be said that, by voting, a man pledges himself to support the Constitution, unless the act of voting be a perfectly voluntary one on his part. Yet the act of voting cannot properly be called a voluntary one on the part of any very large number of those who do vote. It is rather a measure of necessity imposed upon them by others, than one of their own choice. On this point I repeat what was said in a former number,&nbsp;<a id="return-note-1" class="return-anchor"></a><sup><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup> viz:</p>

                            <div class="blockquote">
                                <p>&quot;In truth, in the case of individuals, their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent, <em>even for the time being.</em> On the contrary, it is to be considered that, without his consent having even been asked a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist; a government that forces him to pay money, render service, and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments. He sees, too, that other men practise this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees further, that, if he will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by subjecting them to his own. In short, he finds himself, without his consent, so situated that, if he use the ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it, he must become a slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In self-defence, he attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle, where he must either kill others, or be killed himself. Because, to save his own life in battle, a man attempts to take the lives of his opponents, it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot—which is a mere substitute for a bullet—because, as his only chance of self-preservation, a man uses a ballot, is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered; that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights, as a stake against those of others, to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, in an exigency into which he had been forced by others, and in which no other means of self-defence offered, he, as a matter of necessity, used the only one that was left to him.</p>
                                <p>&quot;Doubtless the most miserable of men, under the most oppressive government in the world, if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of thereby meliorating their condition. But it would not, therefore, be a legitimate inference that the government itself, that crushes them, was one which they had voluntarily set up, or ever consented to.</p>
                                <p>&quot;Therefore, a man’s voting under the Constitution of the United States, is not to be taken as evidence that he ever freely assented to the Constitution, <em>even for the time being.</em> Consequently we have no proof that any very large portion, even of the actual voters of the United States, ever really and voluntarily consented to the Constitution, <em>even for the time being.</em> Nor can we ever have such proof, until every man is left perfectly free to consent, or not, without thereby subjecting himself or his property to be disturbed or injured by others.&quot;</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>As we can have no legal knowledge as to who votes from choice, and who from the necessity thus forced upon him, we can have no legal knowledge, <em>as to any particular individual,</em> that he voted from choice; or, consequently, that by voting, he consented, or pledged himself, to support the government. Legally speaking, therefore, the act of voting utterly fails to pledge <em>any one</em> to support the government. It utterly fails to prove that the government rests upon the voluntary support of any body. On general principles of law and reason, it cannot be said that the government has any voluntary supporters at all, until it can be distinctly shown <em>who</em> its voluntary supporters are.</p>
                            <p><span>4.</span> As taxation is made compulsory on all, whether they vote or not, a large proportion of those who vote, no doubt do so to prevent their own money being used against themselves; when, in fact, they would have gladly abstained from voting, if they could thereby have saved themselves from taxation alone, to say nothing of being saved from all the other usurpations and tyrannies of the government. To take a man’s property without his consent, and then to infer his consent because he attempts, by voting, to prevent that property from being used to his injury, is a very insufficient proof of his consent to support the Constitution. It is, in fact, no proof at all. And as we can have no legal knowledge as to <em>who</em> the particular individuals are, if there are any, who are willing to be taxed for the sake of voting, or who would prefer freedom from taxation to the privilege of voting, we can have no legal knowledge that any particular individual consents to be taxed for the sake of voting; or, consequently, consents to support the Constitution.</p>
                            <p><span>5.</span> At nearly all elections, votes are given for various candidates for the same office. Those who vote for the unsuccessful candidates cannot properly be said to have voted to sustain the Constitution. They may, with more reason, be supposed to have voted, not to support the Constitution, but specially to prevent the tyranny which they anticipate the successful candidate intends to practise upon them under color of the Constitution; and therefore may reasonably be supposed to have voted against the Constitution itself. This supposition is the more reasonable, inasmuch as such voting is the only mode allowed to them of expressing their dissent to the Constitution.</p>
                            <p><span>6.</span> Many votes are usually given for candidates who have no prospect of success. Those who give such votes may reasonably be supposed to have voted as they did, with a special intention, not to support, but to obstruct the execution of, the Constitution; and, therefore, against the Constitution itself.</p>
                            <p><span>7.</span> As all the different votes are given secretly (by secret ballot), there is no legal means of knowing, from the votes themselves, <em>who</em> votes for, and <em>who</em> against, the Constitution. Therefore voting affords no legal evidence that <em>any particular individual</em> supports the Constitution. And where there can be no legal evidence that <em>any particular individual</em> supports the Constitution, it cannot legally be said that anybody supports it. It is clearly impossible to have any legal proof of the intentions of large numbers of men, where there can be no legal proof of the intentions of any particular one of them.</p>
                            <p><span>8.</span> There being no legal proof of any man’s intentions, in voting, we can only conjecture them. As a conjecture, it is probable that a very large proportion of those who vote, do so on this principle, viz., that if, by voting, they could but get the government into their own hands (or that of their friends), and use its powers against their opponents, they would then willingly support the Constitution; but if their opponents are to have the power, and use it against them, then they would <em>not</em> willingly support the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>In short, men’s voluntary support of the Constitution is doubtless, in most cases, wholly contingent upon the question whether, by means of the Constitution, they can make themselves masters, or are to be made slaves.</p>
                            <p>Such contingent consent as that is, in law and reason, no consent at all.</p>
                            <p><span>9.</span> As every body who supports the Constitution by voting (if there are any such) does so secretly (by secret ballot), and in a way to avoid all personal responsibility for the acts of his agents or representatives, it cannot legally or reasonably be said that anybody at all supports the Constitution by voting. No man can reasonably or legally be said to do such a thing as to assent to, or support, the Constitution, <em>unless he does it openly, and in a way to make himself personally responsible for the acts of his agents, so long as they act within the limits of the power he delegates to them.</em></p>
                            <p><span>10.</span> As all voting is secret, (by secret ballot,) and as all secret governments are necessarily only secret bands of robbers, tyrants, and murderers, the general fact that our government is practically carried on by means of such voting, only proves that there is among us a secret band of robbers, tyrants and murderers, whose purpose is to rob, enslave, and, so far as necessary to accomplish their purposes, murder, the rest of the people. The simple fact of the existence of such a band does nothing towards proving that &quot;the people of the United States,&quot; or any one of them, voluntarily supports the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>For all the reasons that have now been given, voting furnishes no legal evidence as to who the particular individuals are (if there are any), who <em>voluntarily</em> support the Constitution. It therefore furnishes no legal evidence that any body supports it <em>voluntarily.</em></p>
                            <p>So far, therefore, as voting is concerned, the Constitution, legally speaking, has no supporters at all.</p>
                            <p>And, as matter of fact, there is not the slightest probability that the Constitution has a single <em>bona fide</em> supporter in the country. That is to say, there is not the slightest probability that there is a single man in the country, who both understands what the Constitution really is, <em>and sincerely supports it for what it really is.</em></p>

                            <p>The ostensible supporters of the Constitution, like the ostensible supporters of most other governments, are made up of three classes, viz.: 1. Knaves, a numerous and active class, who see in the government an instrument which they can use for their own aggrandizement or wealth. 2. Dupes—a large class, no doubt—each of whom, because he is allowed one voice out of millions in deciding what he may do with his own person and his own property, and because he is permitted to have the same voice in robbing, enslaving, and murdering others, that others have in robbing, enslaving, and murdering himself, is stupid enough to imagine that he is a &quot;free man,&quot; a &quot;sovereign&quot;; that this is &quot;a free government&quot;; &quot;a government of equal rights,&quot; &quot;the best government on earth,&quot;&nbsp;<a id="return-note-2" class="return-anchor"></a><sup><a href="#note-2">[2]</a></sup> and such like absurdities. 3. A class who have some appreciation of the evils of government, but either do not see how to get rid of them, or do not choose to so far sacrifice their private interests as to give themselves seriously and earnestly to the work of making a change.</p>
