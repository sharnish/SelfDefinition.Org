                            <p>For the same reasons, the oaths of all the other pretended agents of this secret band of robbers and murderers are on general principles of law and reason, equally destitute of obligation. They are given to nobody; but only to the winds.</p>
                            <p>The oaths of the tax-gatherers and treasurers of the band, are, on general principles of law and reason, of no validity. If any tax gatherer, for example, should put the money he receives into his own pocket, and refuse to part with it, the members of this band could not say to him: You collected that money as <em>our</em> agent, and for <em>our</em> uses; and you swore to pay it over to <em>us,</em> or to those <em>we</em> should appoint to receive it. You have betrayed <em>us,</em> and broken faith with <em>us.</em></p>
                            <p>It would be a sufficient answer for him to say to them:</p>
                            <p>I never knew you. You never made yourselves <em>individually</em> known to me. I never gave my oath to you, as individuals. You may, or you may not, be members of that secret band, who appoint agents to rob and murder other people; but who are cautious not to make themselves individually known, either to such agents, or to those whom their agents are commissioned to rob. If you are members of that band, you have given me no proof of it, and you have no proof that you ever commissioned me to rob others for your benefit. I never knew you, as individuals, and of course never promised you that I would pay over to you the proceeds of my robberies. I committed my robberies on my own account, and for my own profit. If you thought I was fool enough to allow you to keep yourselves concealed, and use me as your tool for robbing other persons; or that I would take all the personal risk of the robberies, and pay over the proceeds to you, you were particularly simple. As I took all the risk of my robberies, I propose to take all the profits. Begone! You are fools, as well as villains. If I gave my oath to anybody, I gave it to other persons than you. But I really gave it to nobody. I only gave it to the winds. It answered my purposes at the time. It enabled me to get the money I was after, and now I propose to keep it. If you expected me to pay it over to you, you relied only upon that honor that is said to prevail among thieves. You now understand that that is a very poor reliance. I trust you may become wise enough to never rely upon it again. If I have any <em>duty</em> in the matter, it is to give back the money to those from whom I took it; not to pay it over to such villains as you.</p>
