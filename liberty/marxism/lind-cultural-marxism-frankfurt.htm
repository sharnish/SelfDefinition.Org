        What happened, in short, is that America's traditional culture, which had grown up over generations from our Western, Judeo-Christian roots, was swept aside by an ideology.

							<h4>Introduction </h4>
							<p> Sometime during the last half-century, someone stole our culture. Just 50 years ago, in
								the 1950s, America was a great place. It was safe. It was decent. Children got good
								educations in the public schools. Even blue-collar fathers brought home middle-class
								incomes, so moms could stay home with the kids. Television shows reflected sound,
								traditional values. </p>
							<p> Where did it all go? How did that America become the sleazy, decadent place we live in
								today &ndash; so different that those who grew up prior to the '60s feel like it's a foreign
								country? Did it just "happen"? </p>
							<p> It didn't just "happen." In fact, a deliberate agenda was followed to steal our culture
								and leave a new and very different one in its place. The story of how and why is one of
								the most important parts of our nation's history &ndash; and it is a story almost no one
								knows. The people behind it wanted it that way.</p>
							<p> What happened, in short, is that America's traditional culture, which had grown up over
								generations from our Western, Judeo-Christian roots, was swept aside by an ideology. We
								know that ideology best as "political correctness" or "multi-culturalism." It really is
								cultural Marxism, Marxism translated from economic into cultural terms in an effort that
								goes back not to the 1960s, but to World War I. Incredible as it may seem, just as the
								old economic Marxism of the Soviet Union has faded away, a new cultural Marxism has
								become the ruling ideology of America's elites. The No. 1 goal of that cultural Marxism,
								since its creation, has been the destruction of Western culture and the Christian
								religion.</p>
							<p> To understand anything, we have to know its history. To understand who stole our
								culture, we need to take a look at the history of "political correctness." </p>

							<h4> Early Marxist Theory</h4>
							<p class="list"> 1. Exploit the Working Classes </p>

							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/karl-marx.jpg" alt="Karl Marx" title="Karl Marx">
								<p class="note">Karl Marx</p>
							</div>
							<p> Before World War I, Marxist theory said that if Europe ever erupted in war, the working
								classes in every European country would rise in revolt, overthrow their governments and
								create a new Communist Europe. But when war broke out in the summer of 1914, that didn't
								happen. Instead, the workers in every European country lined up by the millions to fight
								their country's enemies. Finally, in 1917, a Communist revolution did occur, in Russia.
								But attempts to spread that revolution to other countries failed because the workers did
								not support it. </p>
							<p class="list"> 2. Destroy Christianity &amp; Culture </p>
							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/gyorgy-lukacs.jpg" alt="György Lukács" title="György Lukács" />
								<p class="note"> György Lukács </p>
							</div>
							<p> After World War I ended in 1918, Marxist theorists had to ask themselves the question:
								What went wrong? As good Marxists, they could not admit Marxist theory had been
								incorrect. Instead, two leading Marxist intellectuals, Antonio Gramsci in Italy and
								Georg Lukacs in Hungary (Lukacs was considered the most brilliant Marxist thinker since
								Marx himself) independently came up with the same answer. They said that Western culture
								and the Christian religion had so blinded the working class to its true, Marxist class
								interests, that a Communist revolution was impossible in the West until both could be
								destroyed. That objective, established as cultural Marxism's goal right at the
								beginning, has never changed. </p>

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="new-strategy">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4> A New Strategy </h4>
							<p class="list"> 3. Infiltrate Cultural Influencers </p>
							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/antonio-gramsci.jpg" alt="Antonio Gramsci" title="Antonio Gramsci" />
								<p class="note"> Antonio Gramsci </p>
							</div>
							<p> Gramsci famously laid out a strategy for destroying Christianity and Western culture,
								one that has proven all too successful. Instead of calling for a Communist revolution up
								front, as in Russia, he said Marxists in the West should take political power last,
								after a "long march through the institutions" &ndash; the schools, the media, even the
								churches, every institution that could influence the culture. That "long march through
								the institutions" is what America has experienced, especially since the 1960s.
								Fortunately, Mussolini recognized the danger Gramsci posed and jailed him. His influence
								remained small until the 1960s, when his works, especially the "Prison Notebooks," were
								rediscovered. </p>
							<p class="list"> 4. Sex Education </p>
							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/bela-kun.jpg" alt="Bela Kun" title="Bela Kun" />
								<p> Bela Kun </p>
							</div>
							<p> Georg Lukacs proved more influential. In 1918, he became deputy commissar for culture in
								the short-lived Bela Kun Bolshevik regime in Hungary. There, asking, "Who will save us
								from Western civilization?" he instituted what he called "cultural terrorism." One of
								its main components was introducing sex education into Hungarian schools. Lukacs
								realized that if he could destroy the country's traditional sexual morals, he would have
								taken a giant step toward destroying its traditional culture and Christian faith. </p>
							<p> Far from rallying to Lukacs' "cultural terrorism," the Hungarian working class was so
								outraged by it that when Romania invaded Hungary, the workers would not fight for the
								Bela Kun government, and it fell. Lukacs disappeared, but not for long. In 1923, he
								turned up at a "Marxist Study Week" in Germany, a program sponsored by a young Marxist
								named Felix Weil who had inherited millions. Weil and the others who attended that study
								week were fascinated by Lukacs' cultural perspective on Marxism. </p>

							<h4> The Frankfurt School </h4>
							<p class="list"> 5. Use Stealth</p>
							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/max-horkheimer-theodor-adorno.jpg" alt="Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno" title="Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno" />
								<p class="note">Max Horkheimer (left)<br /> Theodor Adorno (right)</p>
							</div>
							<p> Weil responded by using some of his money to set up a new think tank at Frankfurt
								University in Frankfurt, Germany. Originally it was to be called the "Institute for
								Marxism." But the cultural Marxists realized they could be far more effective if they
								concealed their real nature and objectives. They convinced Weil to give the new
								institute a neutral- sounding name, the "Institute for Social Research." Soon known
								simply as the "Frankfurt School," the Institute for Social Research would become the
								place where political correctness, as we now know it, was developed. The basic answer to
								the question "Who stole our culture?" is the cultural Marxists of the Frankfurt
								School. </p>
							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/eric-fromm.jpg" alt="Eric Fromm" title="Eric Fromm" />
								<p class="note">Eric Fromm</p>
							</div>
							<p> At first, the Institute worked mainly on conventional Marxist issues such as the labor
								movement. But in 1930, that changed dramatically. That year, the Institute was taken
								over by a new director, a brilliant young Marxist intellectual named Max Horkheimer .
								Horkheimer had been strongly influenced by Georg Lukacs. He immediately set to work to
								turn the Frankfurt School into the place where Lukacs' pioneering work on cultural
								Marxism could be developed further into a full-blown ideology.</p>

							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/wilhelm-reich.jpg" alt="Wilhelm Reich" title="Wilhelm Reich" />
								<p class="note">Wilhelm Reich</p>
							</div>
							<p> To that end, he brought some new members into the Frankfurt School. Perhaps the most
								important was Theodor Adorno, who would become Horkheimer's most creative collaborator.
								Other new members included two psychologists, Eric Fromm and Wilhelm Reich, who were
								noted promoters of feminism and matriarchy, and a young graduate student named Herbert
								Marcuse.</p>

							<p class="totop-above-anchor"> <a href="javascript:toTopCleanUrl();">top of page</a> </p>
							<!-- anchor element must not be empty -->
							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="advances">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4> Advances in Cultural Marxism </h4>
							<p> With the help of this new blood, Horkheimer made three major advances in the development
								of cultural Marxism. </p>
							<p class="list">6. Cultural Revolution </p>
							<p> First, he broke with Marx's view that culture was merely part of society's
								"superstructure," which was determined by economic factors. He said that on the
								contrary, culture was an independent and very important factor in shaping a society.
							</p>
							<p class="list">7. Abandon the Working Class </p>
							<p> Second, again contrary to Marx, he announced that in the future, the working class would
								not be the agent of revolution. He left open the question of who would play that role -
								a question Marcuse answered in the 1950s </p>
							<p class="list"> 8. Use Psychological Conditioning</p>

							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/sigmund-freud.jpg" alt="Sigmund Freud" title="Sigmund Freud" />
								<p class="note">Sigmund Freud</p>
							</div>
							<p> Third, Horkheimer and the other Frankfurt School members decided that the key to
								destroying Western culture was to cross Marx with Freud. They argued that just as
								workers were oppressed under capitalism, so under Western culture, everyone lived in a
								constant state of psychological repression. "Liberating" everyone from that repression
								became one of cultural Marxism's main goals. Even more important, they realized that
								psychology offered them a far more powerful tool than philosophy for destroying Western
								culture: psychological conditioning.</p>
							<p class="list">9. Normalize Counterculture</p>
							<p> Today, when Hollywood's cultural Marxists want to "normalize" something like
								homosexuality (thus "liberating" us from "repression"), they put on television show
								after television show where the only normal-seeming white male is a homosexual. That is
								how psychological conditioning works; people absorb the lessons the cultural Marxists
								want them to leam without even knowing they are being taught.</p>
							<p class="list"> 10. NYC &amp; Columbia University</p>
							<p> The Frankfurt School was well on the way to creating political correctness. Then
								suddenly, fate intervened. In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in
								Germany, where the Frankfurt School was located. Since the Frankfurt School was Marxist,
								and the Nazis hated Marxism, and since almost all its members were Jewish, it decided to
								leave Germany. In 1934, the Frankfurt School, including its leading members from
								Germany, was re-established in New York City with help from Columbia University. Soon,
								its focus shifted from destroying traditional Western culture in Germany to doing so in
								the United States. It would prove all too successful.</p>

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="new-developments">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4> New Developments: Critical Theory</h4>
							<p> Taking advantage of American hospitality, the Frankfurt School soon resumed its
								intellectual work to create cultural Marxism. To its earlier achievements in Germany, it
								added these new developments.</p>
							<p class="list"> 11. Criticize All Traditional Institutions</p>
							<p> To serve its purpose of "negating" Western culture, the Frankfurt School developed a
								powerful tool it called "Critical Theory." What was the theory? The theory was to
								criticize. By subjecting every traditional institution, starting with family, to
								endless, unremitting criticism (the Frankfurt School was careful never to define what it
								was for, only what it was against), it hoped to bring them down. Critical Theory is the
								basis for the "studies" departments that now inhabit American colleges and universities.
								Not surprisingly, those departments are the home turf of academic political correctness.

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="studies-in-prejudice">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4> Studies in Prejudice</h4>
							<p class="list"> 12. Define Values As Prejudice</p>
							<p> The Frankfurt School sought to define traditional attitudes on every issue as
								"prejudice" in a series of academic studies that culminated in Adorno's immensely
								influential book, "The Authoritarian Personality," published in 1950. They invented a
								bogus "F-scale" that purported to tie traditional beliefs on sexual morals, relations
								between men and women and questions touching on the family to support for fascism.
								Today, the favorite term the politically correct use for anyone who disagrees with them
								is "fascist."</p>

							<p class="totop-above-anchor"> <a href="javascript:toTopCleanUrl();">top of page</a> </p>
							<!-- anchor element must not be empty -->
							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="domination">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4> Domination</h4>
							<p class="list"> 13. Victimhood &amp; Oppression</p>
							<p> The Frankfurt School again departed from orthodox Marxism, which argued that all of
								history was determined by who owned the means of production. Instead, they said history
								was determined by which groups, defined as men, women, races, religions, etc., had power
								or "dominance" over other groups. Certain groups, especially white males, were labeled
								"oppressors," while other groups were defined as "victims." Victims were automatically
								good, oppressors bad, just by what group they came from, regardless of individual
								behavior.</p>
							<p class="list"> 14. Swap Sins for Virtues</p>
							<p> Though Marxists, the members of the Frankfurt School also drew from Nietzsche. (Someone
								else they admired for his defiance of traditional morals was the Marquis de Sade.) They
								incorporated into their cultural Marxism what Nietzsche called the "transvaluation of
								all values." What that means, in plain English, is that all the old sins become virtues,
								and all the old virtues become sins. Homosexuality is a fine and good thing, but
								anyone who thinks men and women should have different social roles is an evil "fascist."
								That is what political correctness now teaches children in public schools all across
								America. (The Frankfurt School wrote about American public education. It said it did not matter if school
								children learned any skills or any facts. All that mattered was that they graduate from
								the schools with the right "attitudes" on certain questions.)</p>

							<h4> Media and Entertainment</h4>

							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/walter-benjamin.jpg" alt="Walter Benjamin" title="Walter Benjamin" />
								<p class="note">Walter Benjamin</p>
							</div>
							<p> Led by Adomo, the Frankfurt School initially opposed the culture industry, which they
								thought "commodified" culture. Then, they started to listen to Walter Benjamin, a close
								friend of Horkheimer and Adomo, who argued that cultural Marxism could make powerful use
								of tools like radio, film and later television to psychologically condition the public.
								Benjamin's view prevailed, and Horkheimer and Adomo spent the World War II years in
								Hollywood. It is no accident that the entertainment industry is now cultural Marxism's
								most powerful weapon.</p>

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="marxism-us">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4> The Growth of Marxism in the United States</h4>
							<p> After World War II and the defeat of the Nazis, Horkheimer, Adomo and most of the other
								members of the Frankfurt School returned to Germany, where the Institute reestablished
								itself in Frankfurt with the help of the American occupation authorities. Cultural
								Marxism in time became the unofficial but all-pervasive ideology of the Federal
								Republic of Germany.</p>
							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/herbert-marcuse.jpg" alt="Herbert Marcuse" title="Herbert Marcuse" />
								<p class="note">Herbert Marcuse</p>
							</div>
							<p> But hell had not forgotten the United States. Herbert Marcuse remained here, and he set
								about translating the very difficult academic writings of other members of the Frankfurt
								School into simpler terms Americans could easily grasp. His book "Eros and Civilization"
								used the Frankfurt School's crossing of Marx with Freud to argue that if we would only
								"liberate non-procreative eros" through "polymorphous perversity," we could create a new
								paradise where there would be only play and no work. "Eros and Civilization" became one
								of the main texts of the New Left in the 1960s.</p>
							<p class="list"> 16. Exploit Blacks, Women &amp; Homosexuals</p>
							<p> Marcuse also widened the Frankfurt School's intellectual work. In the early 1930s,
								Horkheimer had left open the question of who would replace the working class as the
								agent of Marxist revolution. In the 1950s, Marcuse answered the question, saying it
								would be a coalition of students, blacks, feminist women and homosexuals &ndash; the core of
								the student rebellion of the 1960s, and the sacred "victims groups" of political
								correctness today. </p>
							<p class="list"> 17. Redefine “Tolerance”</p>
							<p> Marcuse further took one of political correctness's favorite words, "tolerance," and
								gave it a new meaning. He defined "liberating tolerance" as tolerance for all ideas and
								movements coming from the left, and intolerance for all ideas and movements coming from
								the right. When you hear the cultural Marxists today call for "tolerance," they mean
								Marcuse's "liberating tolerance" (just as when they call for "diversity," they mean
								uniformity of belief in their ideology).</p>
							<p class="list"> 18. Student Rebellion</p>
							<p> The student rebellion of the 1960s, driven largely by opposition to the draft for the
								Vietnam War, gave Marcuse a historic opportunity. As perhaps its most famous "guru," he
								injected the Frankfurt School's cultural Marxism into the baby boom generation. Of
								course, they did not understand what it really was. As was true from the Institute's
								beginning, Marcuse and the few other people "in the know" did not advertise that
								political correctness and multiculturalism were a form of Marxism. But the effect was
								devastating: a whole generation of Americans, especially the university-educated elite,
								absorbed cultural Marxism as their own, accepting a poisonous ideology that sought to
								destroy America's traditional culture and Christian faith. That generation, which runs
								every elite institution in America, now wages a ceaseless war on all traditional beliefs
								and institutions. They have largely won that war. Most of America's traditional culture
								lies in ruins.</p>

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="counter-strategy">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4> A Counter-Strategy</h4>
							<p> Now you know who stole our culture. The question is, what are we, as Christians and as
								cultural conservatives, going to do about it?</p>
							<p> We can choose between two strategies. The first is to try to retake the existing
								institutions &ndash; the public schools, the universities, the media, the entertainment
								industry and most of the mainline churches &ndash; from the cultural Marxists. They expect us
								to try to do that, they are ready for it, and we would find ourselves, with but small
								voice and few resources compared to theirs, making a frontal assault against prepared
								defensive positions. Any soldier can tell you what that almost always leads to: defeat.
							</p>
							<p> There is another, more promising strategy. We can separate ourselves and our families
								from the institutions the cultural Marxists control and build new institutions for
								ourselves, institutions that reflect and will help us recover our traditional Western
								culture.</p>
							<p> Several years ago, my colleague <strong>Paul Weyrich</strong> wrote an open letter to the conservative
								movement suggesting this strategy.<sup>*</sup> While most other conservative (really Republican)
								leaders demurred, his letter resonated powerfully with grass-roots conservatives. Many
								of them are already part of a movement to secede from the corrupt, dominant culture and

								Similar movements are beginning to offer sound alternatives in other aspects of life,
								including movements to promote small, often organic family farms and to develop community markets for those farms' products. If Brave New World's motto is "Think globally, act locally," ours should be "Think locally, act locally."</p>
							<p> Thus, our strategy for undoing what cultural Marxism has done to America has a certain
								parallel to its own strategy, as Gramsci laid it out so long ago. Gramsci called for
								Marxists to undertake a "long march through the institutions." Our counter-strategy
								would be a long march to create our own institutions. It will not happen quickly, or
								easily. It will be the work of generations &ndash; as was theirs. They were patient, because
								they knew the "inevitable forces of history" were on their side. Can we not be equally
								patient, and persevering, knowing that the Maker of history is on ours?</p>
