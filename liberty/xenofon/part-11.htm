							<p style="margin-top:1em;" class="center note strong">Simonides' counsel, final</p>
							<p>(1) &quot;You must not, Hiero, shrink from spending from your private possessions for the common good. For it seems to me that what a man as tyrant lays out for the city is spent more on what is necessary than what he lays out for his private [estate]. Let us examine each detail point by point. </p>
							<p>(2) &quot;First, which do you think would dignify you more, a house embellished at tremendous cost, or the whole city furnished with walls, temples, colonnades, market places, and harbors? </p>
							<p>(3) &quot;As for arms, which of the two would appear more formidable to your enemies, yourself fitted out in the most splendid arms, or your entire city well armed? </p>
							<p>(4) &quot;Take revenues: in which way do you think they would become greater, if you should keep your private property alone productive, or if you should contrive to make the property of all the citizens so? </p>
							<p>(5) &quot;And regarding the pursuit believed to be the most noble and magnificent of all, the raising of chariot horses, in which way do you think there would be greater dignity, if you yourself should raise the most teams among the Greeks and send them to the games, or if the most breeders, and the most in competition, should be from your city? And as for winning victories, which do you hold the nobler way: by the virtue of your chariot horses, or by the happiness of the city which you rule? </p>
							<p>(6) &quot;I myself say that it is not fitting for a man who is a tyrant even to compete against private men. For, should you win, you would not be admired, but envied, as meeting the cost by means of many estates; and should you lose, you would be ridiculed most of all.</p>
							<p>(7) &quot;But I tell you, Hiero, your contest is against others who rule cities; if you make the city you rule the happiest of these, know well that you will be declared by herald the victor in the most noble and magnificent contest among human beings. </p>
							<p>(8) &quot;First, you would at once secure the love of your subjects, which is the very thing you happen to desire. Further, the herald of your victory would not be one, but all human beings would sing of your virtue. </p>
							<p>(9) &quot;Being an object of attention you would be cherished not only by private men, but by many cities; marveled at not only in private, but in public among all as well; </p>
							<p>(10) &quot;it would be possible for you, as for as safety is concerned, to travel wherever you wish, for the sake of viewing the sights; and it would be possible for you to do this remaining here. For there would be a continual festival by you of those wishing to display whatever wise, beautiful, or good thing they had, and of those desiring to serve you as well. </p>
							<p>(11) &quot;Every man present would be your ally, and every man absent would desire to see you. Therefore, you would not only be liked, you would be loved by human beings; as for the fair, you would not have to seduce them, but submit to being seduced by them; as for fear, that you might suffer some harm; </p>
							<p>(12) &quot;You would have willing men obeying you, and you would see them willingly take thought for you; if there should be some danger, you would see not only allies, but also champions, and those eager; being deemed worthy of many gifts, you will not be at a loss for someone well disposed with whom to share them, with all men rejoicing at your good things and all fighting for those which are yours just as if they were their own. </p>
							<p>(13) &quot;For treasuries, furthermore, you would have all the wealth of your friends.</p>
							<p>&quot;But enrich your friends with confidence, Hiero; for you will enrich yourself. Augment the city, for you will attach power to yourself. Acquire allies for it. </p>
							<p>(14) &quot;Consider the fatherland to be your estate, the citizens your comrades, friends your own children, your sons the same as your life, and try to surpass all these in benefactions. </p>
							<p>(15) &quot;For you prove superior to your friends in beneficence, your enemies will be utterly unable to resist you. And if you do all these things, know well, of all things you will acquire the most noble and most blessed possessions to be met with among human beings, for while being happy, you will not be envied for being happy.&quot;</p>
