							<p>Though I would carefully avoid giving unnecessary offence, yet I am inclined to believe,
								that all those who espouse the doctrine of reconciliation, may be included within the
								following descriptions.</p>
							<p>Interested men, who are not to be trusted, weak men who cannot see, prejudiced men who
								will not see, and a certain set of moderate men who think better of the European world
								than it deserves; and this last class, by an ill-judged deliberation, will be the cause
								of more calamities to this Continent than all the other three.</p>
							<p>It is the good fortune of many to live distant from the scene of present sorrow; the evil
								is not sufficiently brought to their doors to make them feel the precariousness with
								which all American property is possessed. But let our imaginations transport us a few
								moments to Boston; that seat of wretchedness will teach us wisdom, and instruct us for
								ever to renounce a power in whom we can have no trust.&nbsp;<sup>[a]</sup> The
								inhabitants of that
								unfortunate city who but a few months ago were in ease and affluence, have now no other
								alternative than to stay and starve, or turn out to beg. Endangered by the fire of their
								friends if they continue within the city, and plundered by the soldiery if they leave
								it, in their present situation they are prisoners without the hope of redemption, and in
								a general attack for their relief they would be exposed to the fury of both armies.</p>

							</p>
							<p>Men of passive tempers look somewhat lightly over the offences of Great Britain, and,
								still hoping for the best, are apt to call out, Come, come, we shall be friends again
								for all this. But examine the passions and feelings of mankind: bring the doctrine of
								reconciliation to the touchstone of nature, and then tell me whether you can hereafter
								love, honour, and faithfully serve the power that hath carried fire and sword into your
								land? If you cannot do all these, then are you only deceiving yourselves, and by your
								delay bringing ruin upon posterity. Your future connection with Britain, whom you can
								neither love nor honour, will be forced and unnatural, and being formed only on the plan
								of present convenience, will in a little time fall into a relapse more wretched than the
								first. But if you say, you can still pass the violations over, then I ask, hath your
								house been burnt? Hath your property been destroyed before your face? Are your wife
								and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on? Have you lost a parent
								or a child by their hands, and yourself the ruined and wretched survivor? If you have
								not, then are you not a judge of those who have. But if you have, and can still shake
								hands with the murderers, then are you unworthy the name of husband, father, friend, or
								lover, and whatever may be your rank or title in life, you have the heart of a coward,
								and the spirit of a sycophant.</p>
							<p>This is not inflaming or exaggerating matters, but trying them by those feelings and
								affections which nature justifies, and without which we should be incapable of
								discharging the social duties of life, or enjoying the felicities of it. I mean not to
								exhibit horror for the purpose of provoking revenge, but to awaken us from fatal and
								unmanly slumbers, that we may pursue determinately some fixed object. 'Tis not in the
								power of Britain or of Europe to conquer America, if she doth not conquer herself by
								delay and timidity. The present winter is worth an age if rightly employed, but if
								lost or neglected the whole Continent will partake of the misfortune; and there is no
								punishment which that man doth not deserve, be he who, or what, or where he will, that
								may be the means of sacrificing a season so precious and useful.</p>
							<p>'Tis repugnant to reason, to the universal order of things, to all examples from former
								ages, to suppose that this Continent can long remain subject to any external power. The
								most sanguine in Britain doth not think so. The utmost stretch of human wisdom cannot,
								at this time, compass a plan, short of separation, which can promise the continent even
								a year's security. Reconciliation is now a fallacious dream. Nature hath deserted the
								connection, and art cannot supply her place. For, as Milton wisely expresses,
								&quot;never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so
								deep.&quot;</p>
							<p>Every quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual. Our prayers have been rejected with
								disdain; and hath tended to convince us that nothing flatters vanity or confirms
								obstinacy in Kings more than repeated petitioning—and nothing hath contributed more than
								that very measure to make the Kings of Europe absolute. Witness Denmark and Sweden.
								Wherefore, since nothing but blows will do, for God's sake let us come to a final
								separation, and not leave the next generation to be cutting throats under the violated
								unmeaning names of parent and child.
							</p>
							<p>To say they will never attempt it again is idle and visionary; we thought so at the
								repeal of the stamp act, yet a year or two undeceived us; as well may we suppose that
								nations which have been once defeated will never renew the quarrel.</p>
							<p>As to government matters, 'tis not in the power of Britain to do this continent justice:
								the business of it will soon be too weighty and intricate to be managed with any
								tolerable degree of convenience, by a power so distant from us, and so very ignorant of
								us; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. To be always running three or
								four thousand miles with a tale or a petition, waiting four or five months for an
								answer, which, when obtained, requires five or six more to explain it in, will in a few
								years be looked upon as folly and childishness. There was a time when it was proper, and
								there is a proper time for it to cease.</p>
							<p>Small islands not capable of protecting themselves are the proper objects for
								government <sup>[1]</sup> to take under their care; but there is something absurd, in
								supposing a Continent to be perpetually governed by an island. In no instance hath
								nature made the satellite larger than its primary planet; and as England and America,
								with respect to each other, reverse the common order of nature, it is evident that they
								belong to different systems. England to Europe: America to itself.</p>

							<p class="note">1. In some later editions &quot; kingdoms.&quot;—Editor.</p>

							<p>I am not induced by motives of pride, party, or resentment to espouse the doctrine of
								separation and independence; I am clearly, positively, and conscientiously persuaded
								that it is the true interest of this Continent to be so; that every thing short of that
								is mere patchwork, that it can afford no lasting felicity,—that
								it is leaving the sword to our children, and shrinking back at a time when a little
								more, a little further, would have rendered this Continent the glory of the earth.</p>
							<p>As Britain hath not manifested the least inclination towards a compromise, we may be
								assured that no terms can be obtained worthy the acceptance of the Continent, or any
								ways equal to the expence of blood and treasure we have been already put to.</p>
							<p>The object contended for, ought always to bear some just proportion to the expense. The
								removal of North, or the whole detestable junto, is a matter unworthy the millions we
								have expended. A temporary stoppage of trade was an inconvenience, which would have
								sufficiently ballanced the repeal of all the acts complained of, had such repeals been
								obtained; but if the whole Continent must take up arms, if every man must be a soldier,
								'tis scarcely worth our while to fight against a contemptible ministry only. Dearly,
								dearly do we pay for the repeal of the acts, if that is all we fight for; for, in a just
								estimation 'tis as great a folly to pay a Bunker-hill price for law as for land. As I
								have always considered the independancy of this continent, as an event which sooner or
								later must arrive, so from the late rapid progress of the Continent to maturity, the
								event cannot be far off. Wherefore, on the breaking out of hostilities, it was not worth
								the while to have disputed a matter which time would have finally redressed, unless we
								meant to be in earnest: otherwise it is like wasting an estate on a suit at law, to
								regulate the trespasses of a tenant whose lease is just expiring. No man was a warmer
								wisher for a reconciliation than myself, before the fatal nineteenth of April,
								1775,&nbsp;<sup>[2]</sup> but the moment the event of that day was made known, I
								rejected the hardened, sullen-tempered Pharaoh of England for ever; and disdain the
								wretch, that with the pretended title of Father of his people can unfeelingly hear of
								their slaughter, and composedly sleep with their blood upon his soul.</p>
							<p class="note">2. Massacre at Lexington.</p>
							<p>But admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the event? I answer, the ruin
								of the Continent. And that for several reasons.</p>
							<p>First. The powers of governing still remaining in the hands of the King, he will have a
								negative over the whole legislation of this Continent. And as he hath shown himself such
								an inveterate enemy to liberty, and discovered such a thirst for arbitrary power, is he,
								or is he not, a proper person to say to these colonies, &quot;You shall make no laws but
								what
								I please&quot;? And is there any inhabitant of America so ignorant as not to know, that
								according to what is called the present constitution this Continent can make no laws but
								what the king gives leave to; and is there any man so unwise as not to see, that
								(considering what has happened) he will suffer no law to be made here but such as suits
								his purpose? We may be as effectually enslaved by the want of laws in America, as by
								submitting to laws made for us in England. After matters are made up (as it is called)
								can there be any doubt, but the whole power of the crown will be exerted to keep this
								continent as low and humble as possible? Instead of going forward we shall go backward,
								or be perpetually quarrelling, or ridiculously petitioning. We are already greater than
								the King wishes us to be, and will he not hereafter endeavor to make us less? To bring
								the matter to one point, Is the power who is jealous of our prosperity, a proper power
								to govern us? Whoever says No, to this question, is an Independant, for independency
								means no more than this, whether we shall make our own laws, or, whether the King, the
								greatest enemy this continent hath, or can have, shall tell us, &quot;there shall be no
								laws but such as I like.&quot;</p>
							<p>But the King, you will say, has a negative in England; the people there can make no laws
								without his consent. In point of right and good order, it is something very ridiculous
								that a youth of twenty-one (which hath often happened) shall say to several millions of
								people older and wiser than himself, &quot;I forbid this or that act of yours to be
								law.&quot; But in this place I decline this sort of reply, though I will never cease to
								expose the absurdity of it, and only answer that England being the King's residence, and
								America not so, makes quite another case. The King's negative here is ten times more
								dangerous and fatal than it can be in England; for there he will scarcely refuse his
								consent to a bill for putting England into as strong a state of defense as possible, and
								in America he would never suffer such a bill to be passed.
							</p>
							<p>America is only a secondary object in the system of British politics. England consults
								the good of this country no further than it answers her own purpose. Wherefore, her own
								interest leads her to suppress the growth of ours in every case which doth not promote
								her advantage, or in the least interferes with it. A pretty state we should soon be in
								under such a second hand government, considering what has happened! Men do not change
								from enemies to friends by the alteration of a name: And in order to show that
								reconciliation now is a dangerous doctrine, I affirm, that it would be policy in the
								King at this time to repeal the acts, for the sake of reinstating himself in
								the government of the provinces; In order that he may accomplish by craft and subtlety,
								in the long run, what he cannot do by force and violence in the short one.
								Reconciliation and ruin are nearly related.</p>
							<p>Secondly. That as even the best terms which we can expect to obtain can amount to no more
								than a temporary expedient, or a kind of government by guardianship, which can last no
								longer than till the Colonies come of age, so the general face and state of things in
								the interim will be unsettled and unpromising. Emigrants of property will not choose to
								come to a country whose form of government hangs but by a thread, and who is every day
								tottering on the brink of commotion and disturbance; and numbers of the present
								inhabitants would lay hold of the interval to dispose of their effects, and quit the
								Continent.</p>
							<p>But the most powerful of all arguments is, that nothing but independance, i. e. a
								Continental form of government, can keep the peace of the Continent and preserve it
								inviolate from civil wars. I dread the event of a reconciliation with Britain now, as it
								is more than probable that it will be followed by a revolt some where or other, the
								consequences of which may be far more fatal than all the malice of Britain.</p>
