							<p>Perhaps the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not yet sufficiently
								fashionable to procure them general Favor; a long Habit of not thinking a Thing wrong,
								gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable
								outcry in defence of Custom. But the Tumult soon subsides. Time makes more Converts than
								Reason.</p>
							<p>As a long and violent abuse of power is generally the means of calling the right of it in
								question, (and in matters too which might never have been thought of, had not the
								sufferers been aggravated into the inquiry,) and as the King of England hath undertaken
								in his own right, to support the Parliament in what he calls Theirs, and as the good
								People of this Country are grievously oppressed by the Combination, they have an
								undoubted privilege to enquire into the Pretensions of both, and equally to reject the
								Usurpation of either.</p>
							<p>In the following Sheets, the Author hath studiously avoided every thing which is personal
								among ourselves. Compliments as well as censure to individuals make no part thereof. The
								wise and the worthy need not the triumph of a Pamphlet; and those whose sentiments are
								injudicious or unfriendly will cease of themselves, unless too much pains is bestowed
								upon their conversions.</p>
							<p>The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind. Many circumstances
								have, and will arise, which are not local, but universal, and through which the
								principles of all lovers of mankind are affected, and in the event of which their
								affections are interested. The laying a country desolate with fire and sword, declaring
								war against the natural rights of all mankind, and extirpating the defenders thereof
								from the face of the earth, is the concern of every man to whom nature hath given the
								power of feeling; of which class, regardless of party censure, is the
								<!-- no missing words. "Is the Author" -->
							</p>
							<p> AUTHOR.</p>

								P.S. The Publication of this new Edition hath been delayed, with a view of taking
								notice (had it been necessary) of any attempt to refute the Doctrine of
								Independence: As no answer hath yet appeared, it is now presumed that none will, the
								time needful for getting such a Performance ready for the Public being considerably
								past.</p>

							<p>Who the Author of this Production is, is wholly unnecessary to the Public, as the
								Object for Attention is the Doctrine itself, not the Man. Yet it may not be
								unnecessary to say, That he is unconnected with any party, and under no sort of
								Influence, public or private, but the influence of reason and principle.</p>
