							<p style="font-variant: small-caps" class="center">On the origin and design of government in
								general, with concise remarks on the English Constitution</p>
							<p>Some writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little or no
								distinction between them; whereas they are not only different, but have different
								origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness; the former
								promotes our happiness possitively by uniting our affections, the latter negatively by
								restraining our vices. The one encourages intercourse, the other creates distinctions.
								The first is a patron, the last a punisher.</p>
							<p>Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a
								necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one : for when we suffer, or are
								exposed to the same miseries by a Government, which we might expect in a country without
								Government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which
								we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings
								are built upon the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience
								clear, uniform and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not
								being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish
								means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence
								which in every other case advises him, out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore,
								security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that
								whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expence and
								greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.</p>
							<p>In order to gain a clear and just idea of the design and end of government, let us
								suppose a small number of persons settled in some sequestered part of the earth,
								unconnected with the rest; they will then represent the first peopling of any country,
								or of the world. In this state of natural liberty, society will be their first thought.
								A thousand motives will excite them thereto; the strength of one man is so unequal to
								his wants, and his mind so unfitted for perpetual solitude, that he is soon obliged to
								seek assistance and relief of another, who in his turn requires the same. Four or five
								united would be able to raise a tolerable dwelling in the midst of a wilderness, but one
								man might labour out the common period of life without accomplishing any thing; when he
								had felled his timber he could not remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger
								in the mean time would urge him to quit his work, and every different want would call
								him a different way. Disease, nay even misfortune, would be death; for though neither
								might be mortal, yet either would disable him from living, and reduce him to a state in
								which he might rather be said to perish than to die.</p>
							<p>Thus necessity, like a gravitating power, would soon form our newly arrived emigrants
								into society, the reciprocal blessings of which would supercede, and render the
								obligations of law and government unnecessary while they remained perfectly just to each
								other; but as nothing but Heaven is impregnable to vice, it will unavoidably happen that
								in proportion as they surmount the first difficulties of emigration, which bound them
								together in a common cause, they will begin to relax in their duty and attachment to
								each other: and this remissness will point out the necessity of establishing some form
								of government to supply the defect of moral virtue.</p>
							<p>Some convenient tree will afford them a State House, under the branches of which the
								whole Colony may assemble to deliberate on public matters. It is more than probable that
								their first laws will have the title only of Regulations and be enforced by no other
								penalty than public disesteem. In this first parliament every man by natural right will
								have a seat.</p>
							<p>But as the Colony encreases, the public concerns will en-crease likewise, and the
								distance at which the members may be separated, will render it too inconvenient for all
								of them to meet on every occasion as at first, when their number was small, their
								habitations near, and the public concerns few and trifling. This will point out the
								convenience of their consenting to leave the legislative part to be managed by a select
								number chosen from the whole body, who are supposed to have the same concerns at stake
								which those have who appointed them, and who will act in the same manner as the whole
								body would act were they present. If the colony continue encreasing, it will become
								necessary to augment the number of representatives, and that the interest of every part
								of the colony may be attended to, it will be found best to d ivide the whole into
								convenient parts, each part sending its proper number: and that the elected might never
								form to themselves an interest separate from the electors, prudence will point out the
								propriety of having elections often: because as the elected might by that means return
								and mix again with the general body of the electors in a few months, their fidelity to
								the public will be secured by the prudent reflection of not making a rod for themselves.
								And as this frequent interchange will establish a common interest with every part of the
								community, they will mutually and naturally support each other, and on this, (not on the
								unmeaning name of king,) depends the strength of government, and the happiness of the
								governed.</p>
							<p>Here then is the origin and rise of government; namely, a mode rendered necessary by the
								inability of moral virtue to govern the world; here too is the design and end of
								government, viz. Freedom and security. And however our eyes may be dazzled with show, or
								our ears deceived by sound; however prejudice may warp our wills, or interest darken our
								understanding, the simple voice of nature and reason will say, 'tis right.</p>
							<p>I draw my idea of the form of government from a principle in nature which no art can
								overturn, viz. that the more simple any thing is, the less liable it is to be
								disordered, and the easier repaired when disordered; and with this maxim in view I offer
								a few remarks on the so much boasted constitution of England. That it was noble for the
								dark and slavish times in which it was erected, is granted. When the world was overrun
								with tyranny the least remove therefrom was a glorious rescue. But that it is imperfect,
								subject to convulsions, and incapable of producing what it seems to promise, is easily
								demonstrated.</p>
							<p>Absolute governments, (tho' the disgrace of human nature) have this advantage with them,
								they are simple; if the people suffer, they know the head from which their suffering
								springs; know likewise the remedy; and are not bewildered by a variety of causes and
								cures. But the constitution of England is so exceedingly complex, that the nation may
								suffer for years together without being able to discover in which part the fault lies;
								some will say in one and some in another, and every political physician will advise a
								different medicine.</p>
							<p>I know it is difficult to get over local or long standing prejudices, yet if we will
								suffer ourselves to examine the component parts of the English constitution, we shall
								find them to be the base remains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with some new
								Republican materials.</p>
							<p>First.—The remains of Monarchical tyranny in the person of the King.</p>
							<p>Secondly.—The remains of Aristocratical tyranny in the persons of the Peers.</p>
							<p>Thirdly.—The new Republican materials, in the persons of the Commons, on whose virtue
								depends the freedom of England.</p>
							<p>The two first, by being hereditary, are independant of the People; wherefore in a
								constitutional sense they contribute nothing towards the freedom of the State.</p>
							<p>To say that the constitution of England is an union of three powers, reciprocally
								checking each other, is farcical; either the words have no meaning, or they are flat
								contradictions.</p>
							<p>To say that the Commons is a check upon the King, presupposes two things.</p>
							<p>First.—That the King is not to be trusted without being looked after; or in other words,
								that a thirst for absolute power is the natural disease of monarchy.</p>
							<p>Secondly.—That the Commons, by being appointed for that purpose, are either wiser or more
								worthy of confidence than the Crown.</p>
							<p>But as the same constitution which gives the Commons a power to check the King by
								withholding the supplies, gives afterwards the King a power to check the Commons, by
								empowering him to reject their other bills; it again supposes that the King is wiser
								than those whom it has already supposed to be wiser than him. A mere absurdity!</p>
							<p>There is something exceedingly ridiculous in the composition of Monarchy; it first
								excludes a man from the means of information, yet empowers him to act in cases where the
								highest judgment is required. The state of a king shuts him from the World, yet the
								business of a king requires him to know it thoroughly; wherefore the different parts, by
								unnaturally opposing and destroying each other, prove the whole character to be absurd
								and useless.</p>
							<p>Some writers have explained the English constitution thus: the King, say they, is one,
								the people another; the Peers are a house in behalf of the King, the commons in behalf
								of the people; but this hath all the distinctions of a house divided against itself; and
								though the expressions be pleasantly arranged, yet when examined they appear idle and
								ambiguous; and it will always happen, that the nicest construction that words are
								capable of, when applied to the description of something which either cannot exist, or
								is too incomprehensible to be within the compass of description, will be words of sound
								only, and though they may amuse the ear, they cannot inform the mind : for this
								explanation includes a previous question, viz. how came the king by a power which the
								people are afraid to trust, and always obliged to check? Such a power could not be the
								gift of a wise people, neither can any power, which needs checking, be from God; yet the
								provision which the constitution makes supposes such a power to exist.</p>
							<p>But the provision is unequal to the task; the means either cannot or will not accomplish
								the end, and the whole affair is a <em>Felo de se</em>: <span class="note">[felony
									against self, suicide]</span> for as the greater weight will always carry up the
								less, and as all the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to
								know which power in the constitution has the most weight, for that will govern: and tho'
								the others, or a part of them, may clog, or, as the phrase is, check the rapidity of its
								motion, yet so long as they cannot stop it, their endeavours will be ineffectual: The
								first moving power will at last have its way, and what it wants in speed is supplied by
								time.</p>
							<p>That the crown is this overbearing part in the English constitution needs not be
								mentioned, and that it derives its whole consequence merely from being the giver of
								places and pensions is self-evident; wherefore, though we have been wise enough to shut
								and lock a door against absolute Monarchy, we at the same time have been foolish enough
								to put the Crown in possession of the key.</p>
							<p>The prejudice of Englishmen, in favour of their own government, by King, Lords and
								Commons, arises as much or more from national pride than reason. Individuals are
								undoubtedly safer in England than in some other countries: but the will of the king is
								as much the law of the land in Britain as in France, with this difference, that instead
								of proceeding directly from his mouth, it is handed to the people under the formidable
								shape of an act of parliament. For the fate of Charles the First hath only made kings
								more subtle —not more just.</p>
							<p>Wherefore, laying aside all national pride and prejudice in favour of modes and forms,
								the plain truth is that it is wholly owing to the constitution of the people, and not to
								the constitution of the government that the crown is not as oppressive in England as in
								Turkey.</p>
							<p>An inquiry into the constitutional errors in the English form of government, is at this
								time highly necessary; for as we are never in a proper condition of doing justice to
								others, while we continue under the influence of some leading partiality, so neither are
								we capable of doing it to ourselves while we remain fettered by any obstinate prejudice.
								And as a man who is attached to a prostitute is unfitted to choose or judge of a wife,
								so any prepossession in favour of a rotten constitution of government will disable us
								from discerning a good one.</p>
