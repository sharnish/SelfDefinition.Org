							<p>Thousands are already ruined by British barbarity; (thousands more will probably suffer
								the same fate.) Those men have other feelings than us who have nothing suffered. All
								they now possess is liberty; what they before enjoyed is sacrificed to its service, and
								having nothing more to lose they disdain submission. Besides, the general temper of the
								Colonies, towards a British government will be like that of a youth who is nearly out of
								his time; they will care very little about her: And a government which cannot preserve
								the peace is no government at all, and in that case we pay our money for nothing; and
								pray what is it that Britain can do, whose power will be wholly on paper, should a civil
								tumult break out the very day after reconciliation? I have heard some men say, many of
								whom I believe spoke without thinking, that they dreaded an independance, fearing that
								it would produce civil wars: It is but seldom that our first thoughts are truly correct,
								and that is the case here; for there is ten times more to dread from a patched up
								connection than from independance. I make the sufferer's case my own, and I protest,
								that were I driven from house and home, my property destroyed, and my circumstances
								ruined, that as a man, sensible of injuries, I could never relish the doctrine of
								reconciliation, or consider myself bound thereby.</p>
							<p>The Colonies have manifested such a spirit of good order and obedience to Continental
								government, as is sufficient to make every reasonable person easy and happy on that
								head. No man can assign the least pretence for his fears, on any other grounds, than
								such as are truly childish and ridiculous, viz., that one colony will be striving for
								superiority over another.</p>
							<p>Where there are no distinctions there can be no superiority; perfect equality affords no
								temptation. The Republics of Europe are all (and we may say always) in peace. Holland
								and Switzerland are without wars, foreign or domestic. Monarchical governments, it is
								true, are never long at rest: the crown itself is a
								temptation to enterprising ruffians at home; and that degree of pride and insolence ever
								attendant on regal authority, swells into a rupture with foreign powers in instances
								where a republican government, by being formed on more natural principles, would
								negociate the mistake.</p>
							<p>If there is any true cause of fear respecting independance, it is because no plan is yet
								laid down. Men do not see their way out. Wherefore, as an opening into that business I
								offer the following hints; at the same time modestly affirming, that I have no other
								opinion of them myself, than that they may be the means of giving rise to something
								better. Could the straggling thoughts of individuals be
								collected, they would frequently
								form materials for wise and able men to improve into useful matter.</p>

							<p>Let the assemblies be annual, with a president only. The representation
								more equal, their business wholly domestic, and subject to the authority of a
								Continental Congress.</p>
							<p>Let each Colony be divided into six, eight, or ten, convenient districts, each district
								to send a proper number of Delegates to Congress, so that each Colony send at least
								thirty. The whole number in Congress will be at least 390. Each congress to sit and to
								choose a President by the following method. When the Delegates are met, let a Colony be
								taken from the whole thirteen Colonies by lot, after which let the Congress choose (by
								ballot) a president from out of the Delegates of that Province. In the next Congress,
								let a Colony be taken by lot from twelve only, omitting that Colony from which the
								president was taken in the former Congress, and so proceeding on till the whole thirteen
								shall have had their proper rotation. And in order that nothing may pass Into a law but
								what is satisfactorily just, not less than three fifths of the Congress to be called a
								majority. He that will promote discord, under a government so equally formed as this,
								would have joined Lucifer in his revolt.</p>
							<p>But as there is a peculiar delicacy from whom, or in what manner, this business must
								first arise, and as it seems most agreeable and consistent that it should come from some
								intermediate body between the governed and the governors, that is, between the Congress
								and the People, let a Continental Conference be held in the following manner, and for
								the following purpose:</p>
							<p>A Committee of twenty six members of congress, viz. Two for each Colony. Two Members from
								each House of Assembly, or Provincial Convention; and five Representatives of the people
								at large, to be chosen in the capital city or town of each Province, for, and in behalf
								of the whole Province, by as many qualified voters as shall think proper to attend from
								all parts of the Province for that purpose; or, if more convenient, the Representatives
								may be chosen in two or three of the most populous parts thereof. In this conference,
								thus assembled, will be united the two grand principles of business, knowledge and
								power. The Members of Congress, Assemblies, or Conventions, by having had experience in
								national concerns, will be able and useful counsellors, and the whole, being impowered
								by the people, will have a truly legal authority.</p>
							<p>The conferring members being met, let their business be to frame a Continental Charter,
								or Charter of the United Colonies; (answering to what is called the Magna Charta of
								England) fixing the number and manner of choosing Members of Congress, Members of
								Assembly, with their date of sitting; and drawing the line of business and jurisdiction
								between them: Always remembering, that our strength is Continental, not Provincial.
								Securing freedom and property to all men, and above all things, the free exercise of
								religion, according to the dictates of conscience; with such other matter as it is
								necessary for a charter to contain. Immediately after which, the said conference to
								dissolve, and the bodies which shall be chosen conformable to the said charter, to be
								the Legislators and Governors of this Continent for the time being: Whose peace and
								happiness, may God preserve. Amen.</p>
							<p>Should any body of men be hereafter delegated for this or some similar purpose, I offer
								them the following extracts from that wise observer on Governments, Dragonetti.
								&quot;The science,&quot; says he, &quot; of the Politician consists in fixing the true
								point of happiness and freedom. Those men would deserve the gratitude of ages, who
								should discover a mode of government that contained the greatest sum of individual
								happiness, with the least national expense.&quot; (Dragonetti on &quot; Virtues and
								Reward.&quot;)
							</p>
							<p>But where, say some, is the King of America? I'll tell you, friend, he reigns above, and
								doth not make havoc of mankind like the Royal Brute of Great Britain. Yet that we may
								not appear to be defective even in earthly honours, let a day be solemnly set apart for
								proclaiming the Charter; let it be brought forth placed on the Divine Law, the Word of
								God; let a crown be placed thereon, by which the world may know, that so far as we
								approve of monarchy, that in America the law is king. For as in absolute governments the
								King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no
								other. But lest any ill use should afterwards arise, let the Crown at the conclusion of
								the ceremony be demolished, and scattered among the people whose right it is.</p>
							<p>A government of our own is our natural right: and when a man seriously reflects on the
								precariousness of human affairs, he will become convinced, that it is infinitely wiser
								and safer, to form a constitution of our own in a cool deliberate manner, while we have
								it in our power, than to trust such an interesting event to time and chance. If we omit
								it now, some Massanello&nbsp;<sup>[1]</sup> may hereafter arise, who, laying hold of
								popular disquietudes, may collect together the desperate and the discontented, and by
								assuming to themselves the powers of government, finally sweep away the liberties of the
								Continent like a deluge.</p>

							<p class="note">1. Thomas Anello, otherwise Massenello, a fisherman of Naples, who after
								spiriting up his countrymen in the public market place, against the oppression of the
								Spaniards, to whom the place was then subject, prompted them to revolt, and in the space
								of a day became king. </p>
							<p> Should the government of America return again into the hands of
								Britain, the tottering situation of things
								will be a temptation for some desperate adventurer to try his fortune; and in such a
								case, what relief can Britain give? Ere she could hear the news, the fatal business
								might be done; and ourselves suffering like the wretched Britons under the oppression of
								the Conqueror. Ye that oppose independance now, ye know not what ye do: ye are opening a
								door to eternal tyranny, by keeping vacant the seat of government. There are thousands
								and tens of thousands, who would think it glorious to expel from the Continent, that
								barbarous and hellish power, which hath stirred up the Indians and the Negroes to
								destroy us; the cruelty hath a double guilt, it is dealing brutally by us, and
								treacherously by them.</p>

							<p>To talk of friendship with those in whom our reason forbids us to have faith, and our
								affections wounded thro' a thousand pores instruct us to detest, is madness and folly.
								Every day wears out the little remains of kindred between us and them; and can there be
								any reason to hope, that as the relationship expires, the affection will increase, or
								that we shall agree better when we have ten times more and greater concerns to quarrel
								over than ever?</p>
							<p>Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the time that is
								past? Can ye give to prostitution its former innocence? neither can ye reconcile Britain
								and America. The last cord now is broken, the people of England are presenting addresses
								against us. There are injuries which nature cannot forgive; she would cease to be nature
								if she did. As well can the lover forgive the ravisher of his mistress, as the Continent
								forgive the murders of Britain. The Almighty hath implanted in us these
								unextinguishable feelings for good and wise purposes. They are the Guardians of his
								Image in our hearts. They distinguish us from the herd of common animals. The social
								compact would dissolve, and justice be extirpated from the earth, or have only a casual
								existence were we callous to the touches of affection. The robber and the murderer would
								often escape unpunished, did not the injuries which our tempers sustain, provoke us into
								justice.</p>
							<p>O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the tyranny but the tyrant, stand
								forth! Every spot of the old world is overrun with oppression. Freedom hath been hunted
								round the Globe. Asia and Africa have long expelled her. Europe regards her like a
								stranger, and England hath given her warning to depart. O! receive the fugitive, and
								prepare in time an asylum for mankind.</p>
