                                <li>8. (The Yogī who has attained to Sahajavidyā or the Natural Knowledge is) awake and watchful <em>(jāgrat)</em>, (while) the second one, (i.e. "the world", appears) as (his) effulgence of light. </li>
                                <li>9. (This very Yogī is) a Self <em>(ātmā)</em> (that is merely) a dancing actor <em>(nartaka)</em>. </li>
                                <li>10. The stage (for that Nartaka or dancing actor to play is his) inner <em>(antar)</em> soul <em>(ātmā)</em> (which consists of causal and subtle bodies). </li>
                                <li>11. The senses (of that Nartaka or dancing actor are) the spectators (of his playing). </li>
                                <li>12. By means of the superior spiritual intelligence <em>(dhī)</em>, (there is) the realization <em>(siddhiḥ)</em> of the flashing, subtle and inner vibration of the perfect I-consciousness <em>(sattva)</em>. </li>
                                <li>13. The state of being Independent and Free <em>(svatantra)</em> is achieved. </li>
                                <li>14. As there, so elsewhere (that is, "just as that independent Yogī can exhibit Freedom in his own body, he is able to do so in any other place too"; this is the sense). </li>
                                <li>15. (That Yogī should give full) attention to the Seed <em>(bīja)</em>. (In other words, "to the Highest Śakti or the perfect I-consciousness that is the source of the entire manifestation"). </li>
                                <li>16. Established in the power of the Supreme Śakti (or the perfect I-consciousness, which is as a &quot;seat&quot; <em>(āsana)</em> for him, the enlightened Yogī) easily plunges into the Lake (of the divine and immortal Consciousness). </li>
                                <li>17. (That very liberated Yogī can) produce (any forms according to) the measure or aspect of the creative Consciousness <em>(svamātrā)</em> (which is his "āsana" or "seat"). </li>
                                <li>18. As long as Sahajavidyā or Śuddhavidyā, (the Natural or Pure Knowledge) <em>(vidyā)</em>, does not disappear, (the possibility of another) birth (does) disappear (for that sublime Yogī). </li>
                                <li>19. Māheśvarī <span class="note">[Parvati]</span> and other goddesses (who have their sphere of influence) in "ka" group, etc., <span class="note">[the world of letters and words]</span> (and are) the mothers <em>(mātaraḥ)</em> of the limited beings (become his presiding deities).</li>
                                <li>20. The fourth state of consciousness, (which is a Witness), should be poured like (a continuous flow of) oil into (the other) three, (that is, in waking, dreaming and deep sleep). </li>
                                <li>21. One should enter (that fourth state of consciousness) by being immersed (into it) with one's own mind (which must be devoid of any thought, obviously). </li>
                                <li>22. When a slow but firm spreading out of the (Yogī's) vital energy <em>(prāṇa)</em> (occurs), there is equable vision, (that is, the Yogī realizes the unity underlying all). </li>
                                <li>23. In the intervening stage <em>(madhye)</em>, (that is, neither at the initial nor at the final stage of waking, dreaming and dream sleep), there is generation of inferior (mental states) <em>(avara)</em>. </li>
                                <li>24. When there is union between the real I-consciousness and the objects, (there is also) reappearance (of the Bliss of that fourth state of consciousness which had) disappeared (due to the arising of the aforesaid inferior states of mind). </li>
                                <li>25. (That superb Yogī who has attained to the fourth state) becomes equal to Śiva. </li>
                                <li>26. Remaining in the body (is his) vow, (that is to say, he retains a physical form on account of his enormous compassion to humankind; it is really a pious act on his part). </li>
                                <li>27. (His) conversation (is) the muttering (of a Mantra or prayer) <em>(japaḥ)</em>. </li>
                                <li>28. Knowledge <em>(jñānam)</em> of Self <em>(ātma)</em> is (his) gift (for us all). </li>
                                <li>29. He who is established (in the group of powers or Śakticakra is) indeed a means of wisdom. </li>
                                <li>30. The universe (is) the expansion or unfoldment of his own Power <em>(śakti)</em>. </li>
                                <li>31. Both the maintenance (of the universe and its) reabsorption (are also the unfoldment of his Power). </li>
                                <li>32. Even though there may be occurrence of those (three previous processes, viz. manifestation, maintenance and reabsorption of the universe), there is no break (in the inner state of the great Yogī) because of (his) condition as the (Supreme) Knower <em>(saṁvettṛ)</em>. </li>
                                <li>33. (This sublime Yogī) considers pleasure and pain as something external. </li>
                                <li>34. (As the noble Yogī is) completely free from that &ndash;pleasure and pain&ndash;, (he is) alone <em>(kevalī)</em> then. (In short, he has attained to his own Self who is both an "only" Knower and an "only" Mass of pure Consciousness.) </li>
                                <li>35. However, one who is a compact mass of delusion <em>(moha)</em> (is merely) involved in actions <em>(karma)</em>. </li>
                                <li>36. When the difference disappears, the capacity to perform another Creation (appears in the enlightened Yogī). </li>
                                <li>37. (Anyone can realize his) creative <em>(karaṇa)</em> power <em>(śaktiḥ)</em> from his own experience. </li>
                                <li>38. (There should be) enlivening of the three states &ndash;manifestation, maintenance and reabsorption&ndash; by the main one. (In sum, "by the fourth state of consciousness which is a Witness to the other three ones and is full of transcendental Bliss".) </li>
                                <li>39. As (in the case) of the mental states <em>(citta)</em>, (so also regarding) the body, organs of sense and external objects &ndash;bāhya&ndash;, (there should be an "enlivening or vivification" by infusing them with the Bliss of the fourth state of consciousness). </li>
                                <li>40. Because of the desire based on a feeling of want, there is extroversion of the limited being (who is thus subject to the wheel of Saṁsāra or Transmigration from a form of existence to another). </li>
                                <li>41. (Nevertheless,) in the case of (the great Yogī) whose awareness is established in That &ndash;in the fourth state or Turya&ndash;, with the removal <em>(saṅkṣayaḥ)</em> of that (desire), (there is also) complete removal of (the condition of) limited being <em>(jīva)</em>. </li>
                                <li>42. Then, (when the desire finally disappears, that Yogī uses the body which is composed of) gross elements as covering; (and being) completely liberated <em>(vimuktaḥ)</em>, (since he is) pre-eminently equal to Lord (Śiva, he is) perfect and full. </li>
                                <li>43. The link or association of the vital energy <em>(prāṇa)</em> (with the body is) natural. </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        44. (There is vital energy &ndash;prāṇaśakti or prāṇa&ndash;) in the left subtle channel &ndash;Iḍā&ndash;, in the right subtle channel &ndash;Piṅgalā&ndash; (and) in Suṣumnā &ndash;the middle one&ndash;.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By the intense and constant awareness <em>(saṁyamāt) </em>of the center &ndash;that is, the perfect I-consciousness&ndash; of the inner aspect of (the aforesaid) prāṇaśakti, (the Yogī abides in the constant awareness of the supreme and perfect I-consciousness forever).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What else (could one say) in this respect?</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>45. (Regarding the enlightened Yogī), there is over and over again the awareness of the Supreme Self both internally and externally. </li>
