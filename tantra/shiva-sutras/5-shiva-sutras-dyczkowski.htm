							<h4>
								The First Light
							</h4>
							<h5 class="toowide">
								The Description of The Nature of the Light of Universal Consciousness
							</h5>
							<ul class="generic-no-bullet tall">
								<li>1. Consciousness is the Self. </li>
								<li>2. Knowledge is bondage. </li>
								<li>3. The group of sources constitutes the body of obscuring energies. </li>
								<li>4. The ground of knowledge is Matrka. <span class="note">[Universal Mother]</span> </li>
								<li>5. Bhairava <span class="note">[Supreme Being]</span> is upsurge. </li>
								<li>6. When the Wheel of Energies fuses together, the universe is withdrawn. </li>
								<li>7. The consciousness which is the expanse of the Fourth State (abides constantly in) the various (states) of waking, dreaming and deep sleep. </li>
								<li>8. Knowledge (born of sensory perception) is the waking state. </li>
								<li>9. Dreaming consists of thought constructs. </li>
								<li>10. Deep sleep is Maya, the lack of discernment. </li>
								<li>11. The enjoyer of the three states is the Lord of the Heroes.</li>
								<li>12. The planes of union are wonder. </li>
								<li>13. The virgin is the will, the supreme power. </li>
								<li>14. The perceptible is (His) body. </li>
								<li>15. By fixing the mind in the Heart (the yogi) has a vision of the perceivable and of dreams. </li>
								<li>16. Or (the yogi can realise Siva) by contemplating the Pure Principle. </li>
								<li>17. Energy established in its own abode. </li>
								<li>18. Right discernment is the knowledge of the Self. </li>
								<li>19. The bliss of the Light is the joy of contemplation. </li>
								<li>20. The body comes into being when the energies unite. </li>
								<li>21. The union of the elements, the separation of the elements and the union of the universe. </li>
								<li>22. (The yogi) attains mastery of the Wheel by the arising of Pure Knowledge. </li>
								<li>23. (The yogi) experiences the vitality of Mantra by contemplating the Great Lake. </li>

							<h4>
								The Second Light
							</h4>
							<h5>
								The Arising of Innate Knowledge
							</h5>
							<ul class="generic-no-bullet tall">
								<li>1. The mind is Mantra. </li>
								<li>2. Effort is that which attains the goal. </li>
								<li>3. The secret of Mantra is the Being of the Body of Knowledge. </li>
								<li>4. The expansion of the mind in the womb (of consciousness) is the slumber of (all) particular forms of ignorance. </li>
								<li>5. When the knowledge innately inherent in one's own nature arises, (that is) Siva's state - (the gesture of) the one who wanders in the Sky of Consciousness. </li>
								<li>6. The Master is the means. </li>
								<li>7. The awakening of the Wheel of Matrka. </li>
								<li>8. The body is the oblation. <span class="note">[offering]</span></li>
								<li>9. (This yogi's) food is knowledge. </li>
								<li>10. The withdrawal of knowledge heralds the vision of dreams that arises from it. </li>

							<h4>
								The Third Light
							</h4>
							<h5 class="toowide">
								The Vibration of the Powers
							</h5>
							<ul class="generic-no-bullet tall">
								<li>1. The mind is the Self. </li>
								<li>2. (Empirical) knowledge is bondage. </li>
								<li>3. Maya is the lack of discernment of the principles beginning with Kala <span class="note">[time]</span>. </li>
								<li>4. The forces are withdrawn in the body. </li>
								<li>5. The withdrawal of the vital channels, the conquest of the elements, freedom from the elements and the separation of the elements. </li>
								<li>6. (The yogi attains) perfection through the obscuring veil of delusion. </li>
								<li>7. (But) by conquering delusion and by (his) infinite expanse (the yogi) achieves Innate Knowledge. </li>
								<li>8. Waking is the second ray (of consciousness). </li>
								<li>9. The Self is the actor. </li>
								<li>10. The stage is the inner Self. </li>
								<li>11. The spectators are the senses. </li>
								<li>12. The pure state is achieved by the power of the (illumined) intellect. </li>
								<li>13. (Once this has been achieved) freedom is achieved. </li>
								<li>14. As it is here, so is it elsewhere. </li>
								<li>15. The nature (of consciousness) is emission and so that which is not external abides as such. </li>
								<li>16. Constant attention to the seed. </li>
								<li>17. (Confortably) seated (the yogi) sinks effortlessly into the lake (of consciousness). </li>
								<li>18. (Siva) fashions the world by means of His mother. </li>
								<li>19. Once (limited) knowledge is destroyed, rebirth is destroyed. </li>
								<li>20. Mahesvari <sup>[c]</sup> and the other mothers of the soul in bondage reside in the gutterals and the other classes of consonants.

										[c. Goddess Maheshwari (Parvati), the wife of lord Shiva. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati">Wikipedia: Parvati</a> ]
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>21. The Fourth should be sprinkled like oil into the three. </li>
								<li>22. Merged (in his own nature, the yogi) must penetrate (the phonemes) with his mind. </li>
								<li>23. The emergence of the lower (plane) occurs in the centre. </li>
								<li>24. When the breath moves uniformly one has an equal vision of all things. </li>
								<li>25. That which was destroyed arises once more in the course of the unifying awareness of one's own perception of the individual units of experience. </li>
								<li>26. He becomes like Siva. </li>
								<li>27. The activity of the body is the vow. </li>
								<li>28. Common talk is (his) recitation of Mantra. </li>
								<li>29. Self-knowledge is the boon. </li>
								<li>30. Knowledge and the cause reside in the cosmic nature and the source (of the universe). </li>
								<li>31. The universe is the aggregate of his powers. </li>
								<li>32. (Such is also the case with) persistence and absorption. </li>
								<li>33. Even when these are operant, (the subject) is not lost because (he is) the perceiving subjectivity. </li>
								<li>34. (The yogi's) feeling of pleasure and pain is external. </li>
								<li>35. The one who is free of that is a liberated soul. </li>
								<li>36. A compact mass of delusion, the soul is subject to karma. </li>
								<li>37. When diversity has been eliminated (the yogi's) action is to give rise to another creation. </li>
								<li>38. The power of the senses (is proved) by one's own experience. </li>
								<li>39. That which is preceded by the three states vitalizes them. </li>
								<li>40. The same stability of mind (should permeate) the body, senses and external world. </li>
								<li>41. Due to (one's) craving, that which is transported moves outside. </li>
								<li>42. Then (when the yogi) is established in pure awareness (his craving) is destroyed and so the individual soul ceases to exist. </li>
								<li>43. (The soul) clad in the cloak of elements is not free but, like the Lord, becomes supreme once more. </li>
								<li>44. The link with the vital breath is natural. </li>
								<li>45. (The movement of the vital breath is stilled) by concentrating on the centre within the nose. Of what use (then) are the left and right channels or Susumna? </li>
								<li>46. May (the soul) merge (in the Lord) once again. </li>
