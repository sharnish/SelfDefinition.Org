He had numerous teachers who familiarized him with the doctrine of the Agamas <sup>[d]</sup> and its various schools, as well as with the majority of the Indian philosophical systems, including Buddhism. But the teacher whom he venerated above all was Sambhunatha, <sup>[e, f]</sup> who initiated him into the mystical life. Abhinavagupta expresses his veneration for Sambhunatha in the opening stanzas of the Tantraloka.

										[f. According to the Wikipedia article on Abhinavagupta, his teacher Sambhunatha was a practioner of Kaula: "Kaula practices are based on tantra, closely related to the siddha tradition and shaktism. Kaula sects are noted for their extreme exponents who recommend the flouting of taboos and social mores as a means of liberation. Such practices were often later toned down to appeal to ordinary householders, as in Kasmiri Saivism." <a class="wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaula">en.wikipedia.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />Kaula</a>&nbsp;]
									</p>
									<p>
										He <span class="note85">[Abhinavagupta]</span> wrote commentaries on the works of his most famous predecessors, especially Utpaladeva's <em>Isvarapratyabhijnakarika</em>, <sup>[g]</sup> Utpala himself being a disciple of Somananda, <sup>[h]</sup> author of the <em>Sivadrsti.</em>

									Although quite famous throughout India for his brilliant views on aesthetics and drama, his <span class="note85">[Abhinavagupta's]</span> unpublished other works and commentaries have been overlooked for a long time. Published only within the last century, they are now somewhat better known, and have been the subject of translations into various European languages. The reader will find various excerpts from some of his original works and commentaries in this article. The Tantraloka is a vast compendium of the whole of Saivite philosophy and mystical practice.

Master Eckhart, who also emphasizes a vibrant, internally present God, writes that true possession of God &quot;rests upon a feeling in the heart ... upon an orientation of the will toward God. Not upon a fixed, permanent idea of God! Man should not be satisfied with an <em>idea</em> of God, for when the idea disappears, so will God. But one should have a <em>real</em> God, beyond the thoughts of men and beyond all creation. This God will not disappear, that is, unless one voluntarily turns from him. A person who thus posesses God, essentially, takes God as divine, and God shines before him through all things.
