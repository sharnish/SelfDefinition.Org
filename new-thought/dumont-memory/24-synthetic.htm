							<h4>
								Synthesis
							</h4>

							<p>
								We have considered the first two methods of efficient association, namely (1) Analysis, and (2) Comparison, We now pass to the third, known as Synthesis.
							</p>
							<p>
								Synthesis is the reverse or opposite of Analysis, for the former serves to build up, combine and generalize, whereas Analysis tears apart, separates, dissects, and particularizes. Synthesis may be defined as &quot;the putting of two or more things together,&quot; In the sense in which we now use it, the term may be said to mean Classification, or Generalization.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is a well-known principle of psychology that things may be forcibly associated in memory by reason of being grouped into logical, and natural classes, families, divisions, etc. This is akin to the placing together in the same compartment, drawer, or envelope, of things closely resembling each other. The receptacle is also generally found immediately adjoining one containing the things as nearly opposite as possible&mdash;in accordance with the rules just described. This being so, it follows that the man of trained mind and memory will have acquired the habit of careful classification, and synthesis. This characteristic, by the way, is a most always found in the cases of men of the scientific mind, not only in science proper, but also in the professions, trades and business life. The efficient man in any walk of life, is generally found to be possessed of the scientific habit of classification, grouping, and mental-filing methods.
							</p>
							<p>
								A leading writer has said on this subject: &quot;The man who has not properly classified the myriad individual objects with which he has to deal must advance like a cripple. He, only, can travel with seven league boots, who has thought out the relations existing between these stray individuals and put them into their proper classes. In a minute, a business man may put his hand upon any one of ten thousand letters, if they are properly classified. In the same way, the student of any branch, can, if he studies the subjects aright, have all his knowledge classified and speedily available for use.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								A leading lawyer once said: &quot;It is not so much a matter of knowing the law on a subject, as it is of knowing where to find that law.&quot; This is the secret of many an efficient memory. Such a memory is divided into sections, divisions, and subdivisions&mdash;and these linked by association with others, until the whole is a wonderful system of classified order and efficient grouping, the contents of which are speedily and easily available, with the minimum expenditure of effort and time.
							</p>
							<p>
								I strongly advise my pupils to make a written chart or diagram of any subject with which they wish to familiarize themselves, placing each important division of the idea in its proper place, and its proper and logical relation to other divisions. The mind will then take up the impression of such a diagram, and will reproduce the arrangement in memory. The preacher or lawyer does this in preparing his sermon or argument, and actually &quot;sees&quot; these divisions in his mind's eye when he begins to speak, and all through his discourse. The efficient salesman does the same thing, and thus gets the best result of his work. Students will find this idea invaluable to them in preparing for examinations, or in impressing upon their memories the knowledge they acquire during their attendance at school. Efficiency in almost any line of mental work, consists in &quot;diagramming&quot; the knowledge acquired by experience and study.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just as the operations of the mind may be classified into three groups, viz.: (1) Feeling; (2) Thinking; and (3) Willing&mdash;these, in turn, being subdivided&mdash;so may any subject so be classified to advantage, and its contents grouped into logical groups and &quot;bunches,&quot; each with its proper label. When one needs any fact, idea, or bit of information on a subject so arranged, he has but to go to the proper division, and pull out the proper drawer, and there, in the proper part of that little drawer, will be found the particular thing required. The card-index idea may well be applied to the memory, and put to the best use therein.
							</p>
							<p>
								The proper rule for classification, of course is to put things together in the order of their degrees of resemblance&mdash;with a cross reference to their &quot;opposites,&quot; as I have said before. The same thing may be placed in several classes&mdash;in fact the more classes the better, for it may be more readily found in such case. To get the idea, go to some good library and carefully study their card-index, and their system of classification. You will find that every particular class of books has, first its general class number&mdash;it is in &quot;the 100s,&quot; or &quot;the 300s,&quot; or &quot;the 900s,&quot; And so on. Then these &quot;hundreds&quot; are subdivided into sections Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., then comes a closer subdivision, and so on until it comes down to individual books.
							</p>
							<p>
								Do you realize that under the system in use in the best libraries, a person familiar with it can go to the shelves of any other good library using the same system, and pick out any book wanted, in a moment or two. Any book of the tens of thousands of books in these libraries, remember. Such a person would first go to the division of shelves numbered in the &quot;hundreds;&quot; then he would find the right subdivision, by its known and uniform number; and then the smaller subdivision, in the same way. Finally, he would pick out the desired book from the very small possible place in which it must be found.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just as in a card-index there is only one place in which any particular name can possibly rightly be placed, so in a well classified mind there is a certain place (or places, in the case of ideas) in which a thing can be rightfully placed. Know the place, and you can always find the thing there.

							<h4>
								Zoological Classification
							</h4>

							<p>
								As an example of efficient classification. I herewith present to your attention the well-known zoological classification, which includes every known animal, and has a proper place in it for any newly discovered one. The botanical classification is equally complete; and so is that of minerals, etc. Here follows the zoological scale of classes:
							</p>
							<p>
								I. The Protozoa, or class of very low one-celled forms of animal life, which includes the sub-classes of (1) the Monera, which is like a living minute drop of glue; (2) the Amoebae, which has a nucleus at its centre, and which manifests rudimentary extensions which serve as feet, etc.; (3) the Foraminifera, which are like the preceding form, except that they secrete a minute shell from the lime of the water; (4) the Polycystina, which secrete a skeleton-like structure from the water; (5) the Infusoria, which resemble the Amoebae, except that they have developed filaments which act as rudimentary permanent limbs, and have also developed a rudimentary mouth-opening and gullet&mdash;the prophecy of the organs in the higher classes of living things.
							</p>
							<p>
								II. The Coelenterata, or &quot;hollow-bodied&quot; family, which comprises the sub-families of sponges, polyps, anemones, coral-builders, etc. The lowest sub-family of this group is that of the (1) Sponges, including the common varieties known to commerce, and also some very delicate and beautiful forms not seen by the public except in museums, etc. The common &quot;sponge&quot; of commerce, is merely the soft skeleton of a low type of sponge, the soft jelly-like body of which has been cleaned away from it. These lowly animals have whip-like filaments which drive the food into the numerous canals of its body, where it is caught and digested. Another sub-family of this group is that known as the (2) Hydra, or tiny cup or tube-shaped polyps, of which the well-known jelly-fish is a variety. The beautiful (3) Sea-Anemones, also constitute a sub-family of this group, as do also the (4) Coral-builders whose skeletons form the coral-reefs and coral islands, after the soft bodies have disappeared.
							</p>
							<p>
								III. The Echinodermata, or &quot;spiny-bodied&quot; family, which comprises the sub-families of sea-urchins, star-fish, etc. This family includes very many species and varieties, all of whom bear the distinguishing feature of spines or prickles (like those of the hedgehog), or else jointed or leathery plates. We find a distinct nervous system among these animals, and even an eye with lenses.
							</p>
							<p>
								IV. The Vermes or &quot;Worm&quot; family, which comprises the sub-families of worms, leeches, etc.&mdash;seven great groups of footless-jointed creatures. There is a very close relationship between this great family, and the one next to be described, in fact, the two families may be said to blend into each other.
							</p>
							<p>
								V. The Arthropoda, or &quot;jointed-footed&quot; family, which comprises the sub-families of crabs, spiders, ants, all insects, etc. As I have just said, this family really blends into the preceding one&mdash;the crawling young insect, for instance, bearing a very close resemblance to the worm family. The Insect sub-family, of course, has very many thousand species, and many sub-families and smaller divisions. Its members are jointed like the worms, but have limbs which are lacking in the former, and which have been developed from the muscle-fibres, in pairs. Among its sub-families are the wormlike (1) Peripatus creatures; the (2) Crustacea, including the many varieties of lobsters, crabs, shrimps, etc.; the (3) Myriopoda, or centipedes, millipedes, etc.; the great (4) Insecta sub-family, which includes all true insects; and also the sub-family of the (5) Arachnida, which includes all spiders, mites, scorpions, etc. The mark of the true Insects, is that thread-like connection between the otherwise separated three parts of the creatures. The name &quot;insecta,&quot; means &quot;cut into,&quot; and bears a close resemblance to the English words &quot;in sections,&quot; you will notice&mdash;this, by-the-way will help you to remember the meaning of this form. The Insect sub-family, of course, has very many sub-divisions, sub-groups, species, etc.

									Tridacna
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								VI. The Mollusca, or &quot;soft-bodied, usually protected by a shell&quot; family which comprises the sub-families of sea-squirts, oysters, clams, snails, slugs, small cuttle fish, etc. This is a large family, containing members of high and low degree. It ranges not only from low organism to that much higher, from the ugly oyster to the beautiful pearly nautilus, but also from the 500 lb. tridacna of the tropical seas, to the minute creatures of the temperate zone, which require many thousands to weigh an ounce. Some of its species are fixed in position, like a plant; while &quot;pouched milk-giver&quot; group, inducting the opossums, kangaroos, etc., the distinguishing mark of which is the mother's pouch in which the imperfect young are kept until they can run alone. Then come the highest group called the (c) Placentals, whose young are born fully formed, having been nourished in the mother's womb by means of the placenta. This group comprises the Higher Animals, and is carefully sub-divided into many classes, and sub-classes, according to certain leading structural characteristics common to the various specics included in each class.

							<h4>
								CLASSES OF PLACENTALS.
							</h4>
							<p>
								The following is the classification of the Placentals, adopted by many of the best authorities:
							</p>
							<p>
								1.&nbsp;Edentata, or &quot;Toothless,&quot; including the sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos. (While called &quot;toothless&quot; some of its species have rudimentary teeth&mdash;but not true teeth.)
							</p>
							<p>
								2.&nbsp;Sirenia, or &quot;Sirens&quot; (so-called from their fanciful resemblance to the mermaids or sirens of mythology), including dugongs and manatees, or sea-cows, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								3.&nbsp;Cetacea, &quot;Whale-like,&quot; including whales, dolphins, porpoises.
							</p>
							<p>
								4.&nbsp;Ungulata, or &quot;Hoofed,&quot; including the &quot;odd-toed, as the horse, the tapir, and the rhinoceros; and the &quot;even-toed,&quot; as the swine, the hippopotamus, camel, deer, sheep, cow.
							</p>

							<p>
								5.&nbsp;Hyracoidea, or &quot;Rock-Rabbit,&quot; including the coney family, which has hoofs, yet gnaws like the gnawing animals&mdash;this is another strange animal, seemingly between two families.
							</p>
							<p>
								6.&nbsp;Proboscidea, or &quot;Trunked,&quot; including the various species of elephants.
							</p>
							<p>
								7.&nbsp;Carnivora, or &quot;Flesheaters,&quot; including seals, bears, weasels, wolves, all the great dog family, foxes, jackals, etc.; lions, tigers, leopards, and all the other members of the great cat family.
							</p>
							<p>
								8. Rodentia, or &quot;Gnawers,&quot; including hares, rats, mice, beavers, squirrels, etc., and constituting a very large family.
							</p>
							<p>
								9.&nbsp;Insectovora, or &quot;Insect-Feeders&quot; including the mole, hedgehog, shrew.
							</p>
							<p>
								10.&nbsp;Cheiroptera, or &quot;Finger-winged,&quot; including the various species of bats.
							</p>
							<p>
								11.&nbsp;Lemuroidea, or &quot;Lemurs,&quot; including the peculiar class of monkey-like creatures who also have marked affinities with the marsupials, gnawers and insect-feeders. They form a subgroup &quot;all by themselves.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								12.&nbsp;Primates, or &quot;Chief Class,&quot; including the monkeys, baboons, man-like apes (gibbon, orang-outang, chimpanzee, gorilla), all distinguished by big-jaws, small-brains, and stooping posture; also Man, in high and low degree, distinguished by big-brains, and erect posture. Man, again, is divided in many races, according to shape of skull, color of skin, nature of hair, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								The above zoological classification should be carefully studied and considered by the pupil, not alone for the value of the information therein contained, but also as a training for the mind in careful comparison and classification. A little thought will show you that it was the work of the most careful minds to set apart the class of vertebrates, for instance, which finds the common and general characteristic of a &quot;backbone&quot; distinguishing such a wide variety of animals as the frogs, reptiles, fishes, birds, and mammals, and thus groups them into a great family. The distinction of backbone, or no-backbone, at once divides the animal kingdom into two great subdivisions. In the same way the division of the vertebrates into mammals, and non-mammals, makes another striking division into two classes. And, finally, the division of the Placentals into the twelve groups above mentioned, required the presence of the keenest intellect.
							</p>
							<p>
								Notice the method of the zoologist in making this classification. He first makes the broad, wide classifications, and then divides these into smaller, and these into still smaller, and so on&mdash;each classification being based on striking points of resemblance and difference. The result is that the zoologist discovering an animal unknown to him, can place it in the scale in a few moments, working from the large divisions down to the smallest.
							</p>
							<p>
								The technical divisions of the zoologist are named as follows: (1) the sub-kingdom; (2) the class; (3) the order; (4) the family; (5) the genus; (6) the species; (7) the variety; (8) the individual. In stating the classification, in this chapter, I have used the term, &quot;family,&quot; &quot;class,&quot; etc., in a loose sense. Look at your dictionary and when you see that a &quot;bird&quot; is defined as &quot;a warm-blooded, feathered, winged vertebrate&quot; you will now know just what that definition means&mdash;each and every bird must possess those characteristics to be a bird. The bird family has, of course, many families, species and varieties, all of which have their own particular distinguishing characteristics&mdash;but every bird must have the general &quot;bird&quot; characteristics.
							</p>
							<p>
								Every thing, of any kind or degree, has its own particular place in the great card-index of the mind. True education results in the placing of everything in its right place, when that place is found. Human reason is ever seeking to find the right place into which a particular thing may fit, and it does this largely by perception, comparison, association, classification&mdash;all of which we have seen to play an important part in memory. Do you not see, more and more as you progress, the close relation between memory training and mind training?
							</p>
							<p>
								Would you like to know how Men are classified&mdash;following the same system? Here it is then&mdash;it may contain some surprises for you&mdash;it is well worth your study, for its own sake, and for the sake of exercise in classification.

							<h4>
								CLASSES OF MEN.
							</h4>
							<p>
								Men are classed primarily as follows:
							</p>
							<p>
								I.&nbsp;Wooly-Haired (nearly all long-headed), which are divided as follows (a) tuft-haired, which comprise Papuans and Hottentots as its two varieties; and (b) Fleece-Haired, which comprise the two varieties of Kaffirs and Negroes.
							</p>
							<p>
								II.&nbsp;Straight-Haired (nearly all broad-headed, with the exception of the Esquimaux and native Australians who are long-headed) which are divided into two classes as follows: (a) Stiff-haired, including the Australians, Malays, Mongols, Arctics, American Indians, with the numerous varieties of each class; and (b) Curly-Haired, which include the Dravidas, <span class="note">[Dravidians]</span> Nubians, and Mediterranean groups. Passing by the Dravidas and Nubians, which have have few such divisions, let us follow the analysis of the Mediterranean Group of the Curly-Haired branch of the Straight-Haired (broad-headed) family of men&mdash;this is the one to which the writer and, in all probability, the student, belongs.
							</p>
							<p>
								THE MEDITERRANEAN GROUP. This great, and ruling, group of mankind is divided as follows: (1) Basques; and (2) Caucasian. The Basques have practically no sub-divisions, being a small race. The Caucasian group comprises (a) the Semitic races, including the Hebrews, Arabs, and probably the Egyptians; (b) the Indo-Romanic group, including the Hindus (high-caste), Persians, Greeks, and Romans; (c) the Slavo-Germanic group, including the Slavs, Scandanavians, Teutons, and Celts. From the last classification, we may easily proceed to divide into nations, provinces, and smaller classes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Proceeding further, we reach individual families, and the members thereof&mdash;every single person has his place in the scale. The principle is the same as in the animal kingdom, the vegetable, the mineral, or in the general world of ideas&mdash;always proceeding from the great classification to the lesser, and so on until the individual is finally reached and &quot;ticketed&quot; or indexed. You will note that the principle of the cataloguing of a modern library (as previously noted) is applied to the animal kingdom, and to the race of mankind, all with equal precision and regularity, and with equally satisfactory result when completed.

								SPECIAL NOTE
							</h4>

							<p>
								(NOTE: The above tables of classification will serve as excellent material for the use of the student in committing to memory a classified subject. In this work, I advise the application of the system of Cumulative Memorizing, which I describe and teach in a succeeding lesson. Not only is the subject matter well worth committing to memory, but, as an exercise, this material is excellent, by reason of being broken up into small divisions, and also by reason of its classification being in accordance with strict logic and scientific arrangement. The student, by using it as above indicated, will not only strengthen and exercise his memory, but will also, unconsciously and gradually acquire the mental habit of thinking of, and remembering, things in classified order and arrangement. Practice of this kind is akin to the laying of mental rails over which the train of thought and memory may run easily.)
