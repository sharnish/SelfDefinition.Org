								Memory not a faculty, but is a peculiar attribute of the mind. All knowledge is but remembrance. Knowledge is a structure built of the bricks of memory. Every faculty has its own particular memory. The machinery for registering mental impressions. The subconscious storehouse for preserving the mental impressions. The machinery for recalling mental impressions. The cultivation of the memory is really a cultivation of the mind itself. The folly of pseudo-memory systems. Disappointments of &quot;trick&quot; memory systems. Education without memory is like pouring water into a sieve. All mental evolution depends upon the cement of memory. No man is greater than his memory. Man is but a combination of memories. Memory the secret of efficiency.

								Memory the chief priest in the Temple of Mind. Memory the golden thread that links all the mental gifts together. Some memories like marble; others like soft sand. Shifting character the result of poor memory. The habitual &quot;forgetter&quot; is apt to be a social nuisance. The educated man a dunce if his memory is poor. The best memory may be improved, and the poorest rendered far above the average by scientific memory training. Marvellous results possible under the system and principles taught in this book. How science remedies nature's defects. All human efficiency depends upon memory for its basic powers. Every act of efficiency really an act of memory. Genius is the infinite capacity for taking pains&mdash;plus a good memory.

								The Importance of the &quot;why&quot; side of things, as well as the &quot;know how&quot; side. The value of an understanding of the underlying philosophy of memory. You should become a thinking, reasoning individual with an efficient memory, and not a mere memory machine. A good working philosophy of memory, not technical psychological or metaphysical dogmatism. The memory is a psychological phonograph machine. It receives impressions from the senses; makes a record of the same; files away the record; indexes its records; and finally, brings forth its records when required&mdash;providing that it is kept well-oiled and cared for. How it performs these wonderful functions. The great subconscious storage room of memory records. Nothing once recorded is ever entirely lost. There is no ultimate forgetting.

								Strength of memory impressions dependant upon attention. Attention dependant upon interest. You remember that which most interests you. The mechanical memory for trivial things found in uncultured persons. &quot;Parrot memory&quot; vs. intelligent memory. Wonderful memory of low degree manifested by idiotic persons. The futility of the &quot;trick systems&quot; of mechanical memory. The principle of &quot;association&quot; the key to memory high and low. Mechanical memory brings no real understanding. The memory of the cultured, educated man, and what it consists of. Comparison, association of similarity, and constructive imagination, all accompany true memory training. Constructive imagination really an active phase of the higher memory. Distinction between the memory of vulgar minds and cultivated minds.

								Remarkable instances of memory power, normal and abnormal. Facts of extraordinary memory stranger than fiction. Historical instances, vouched for by good authority. Pascal forgot nothing that he had carefully read. Grotius remembered everything that he had ever thought out. Cardinal Mezzofanti knew over one hundred languages, and never forgot a word once learned. Leyden easily remembered long documents, and Acts of Parliament, after one reading. Bidder knew the Bible by heart, and could give any verse called for. Marvellous memory of chess-players. Startling memory of musicians. The memory of the Chinese scholars. Strange instances from Oriental lands. Memorizing the entire works of Confucius. Whole religions books, equal in length to our Bible, committed to memory by the Orientals.

The Druids memorized their religious doctrines. The ancient laws of Iceland memorized by judges and lawyers. Memory of the Algonquin Indians for their sagas of interminable length. Cyrus knew Roman citizens after once meeting them, and called each man by his right name. Cyrus called by name every soldier in his army. Themistocles called by name each of 30,000 Athenian citizens. The Corsican who could remember 35,000 disconnected words. The librarian who could remember every book in the libraries of Florence.

								Memory without attention is like a phonograph without a needle. Without attention there is no impression on the record of memory. Attention the most marked manifestation of will. Attention closely allied to consciousness. Attention dependant upon concentration. Concentrated attention focuses the consciousness. How clear, sharp, intense, and vivid impressions are received. Instances of concentrated attention. Concentrated attention magnifies the power of impressions. Concentration like the power of the sunglass. Highly developed attention the secret of genius. Attention is the eye of the mind, and must be directed to an object in order for the mind to perceive it. Vivid consciousness, long memory; faint consciousness, short memory; no consciousness, no memory. Power of voluntary attention.

								The modern discovery of the great subconscious planes of mind has revolutionized all former conceptions of memory. Every student of memory should be familiar with the laws of the subconscious mentality. The great region of mind outside the field of consciousness&mdash;the greater part of mental activity performed there. The subconscious mind is the great storehouse of memory. All records of mental impressions stored there. Everything remembered is recalled from the subconscious mind. The depths and heights of the mind. All true systems of memory based upon storing away, indexing, and cross-indexing the records of the subconscious. The subconscious and the mechanism of memory. Where the impressions of memory rest when not brought into the field of consciousness. Opinion of eminent authorities.

								Valuable points of practice regarding the principle of perception. The facility of recollection depends upon the clearness and strength of the impression. The depth and clearness of the impression depends upon the interest-attention, or attention-interest Always build a strong primary foundation impression; then build subsequent impressions around It. Let your primary impression consist of main facts, points, principles, etc., omitting unimportant details. Add the details in subsequent impressions. Classify your impressions into divisions and subdivisions. Original impressions should be intensified by frequent revivals in memory. Strengthening impressions by reviving the impression in memory, without reference to original object. Always associate a new thing in memory with old things. Importance of classification.
