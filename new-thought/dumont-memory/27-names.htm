								The failure to recollect surnames, or, perhaps, to identify particular persons with their rightful surnames, is one of the most frequent complaints on the part of persons who interpret the same as an indication that they &quot;have a poor memory,&quot; or that their &quot;memory is failing,&quot; etc. This, notwithstanding the fact that many of these same persons have no trouble in remembering and recollecting other things, or in memorizing long lists, verses, etc. How often do we witness the confusing; &quot;Would you mind telling me your name&mdash;I've such a poor memory for names!&quot; or the equally humiliating: &quot;I remember your face very well indeed, but I can't recall your name!&quot; How many persons complain: &quot;I have an excellent memory for faces, but such a wretched memory for names!&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								The trouble with the majority of these name-forgettors is (1) that they have not cultivated a sufficient interest in, or knowledge of names, and, consequently, do not make sufficiently strong name impressions on their memory records or (2) they have not cultivated the art of making-the proper association, connection or &quot;link&quot; between the impression of the person, and his name; or, possibly (3) they suffer from a combination of both of these &quot;lacks.&quot; But these inefficiencies may be remedied, as I well know my twenty years experience in teaching pupils the science and art of memory. I have known persons originally very &quot;weak on names&quot; to cultivate themselves to such an extent that they became noted for their wonderful and extraordinary memory and recollection of names.
							</p>
							<p>
								INTEREST IN NAMES. To the average person a name is simply an arbitrary and meaningless label or &quot;tag&quot; placed on a person for the purpose of identification. Such a one is not in the least interested in the subject of names, and cannot even imagine that any other persons can find the subject one for interest. But even such persons will realize that, occasionally, some peculiar name will attract their attention, either by reason of its oddity, or because of some semi-humorous resemblance to some other thing. And, a little thought would cause these persons to realize that, as a rule, they have very little trouble in remembering and recalling this class of names. Though they may not realize it, the reason for this preference in memory is merely that they were interested in the odd or peculiar name, and therefore impressed it more strongly on the memory.
							</p>
							<p>
								One may not remember Smith, Jones, or Brown, but he remembers Younghusband, Crookshank, or Bloodgood, very well indeed, while Darling or Sunshine involuntarily recall themselves at unexpected moments. Such persons may also notice that they find it much easier to remember &quot;nicknames,&quot; than the ordinary surnames. &quot;Fatty Brown&quot; is remembered, where his brother James J. Brown is forgotten; and &quot;Red&quot; Flynn is easily recalled, while P. J. Flynn has slipped away from memory. A little thought will show you that this is largely because of interest, or lack of it. The moral is: Take an interest in persons' names, and you will begin to like them, and consequently to remember them easily.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the first thought, the subject of surnames does not seem to be one calculated to arouse or hold much human interest. But if you will pick up some good book on the subject of surnames, you will soon begin to get interested in spite of yourself, for the study of the origin, derivation, changes, variations, of surnames is a fascinating one to many minds. Consult the library of any large city, and under the head of &quot;Names&quot; or &quot;Surnames,&quot; you will find a number of interesting books on the subject.
							</p>
							<p>
								On the subject of English surnames, perhaps the most exhaustive book is &quot;Bardsley's Dictionary of English Surnames,&quot; which gives a list of nearly every English surname, with its origin, and its variations. But, the most interesting work I have ever read on the subject, is entitled &quot;The Romance of Names,&quot; by Ernest Weekley, M. A. (John Murray, London, Eng. 1914). <sup>[1]</sup> I defy you to read this last mentioned book, and fail to take a new interest in the study and subject of surnames.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24374">gutenberg.org (ebook)</a>&nbsp;]
							</p>
							<p>
								If you do not care to go to the trouble of reading a book of this kind on the subject of names (though such a study will repay you well if you are &quot;weak on names&quot;), you should at least try to take enough interest to look for the meaning of names, their resemblances, points of difference, etc. By doing so you will gradually build up an interest in surnames, and will, at the same time, notice that your memory for names is improving.
							</p>
							<p>
								Surnames may be grouped into classes, with regard to their origin, in the majority of cases, although some of them have become so distorted, altered, and abbreviated, that It is almost impossible to locate and place them, without reference to books such as I have mentioned. Many names are but baptismal personal names afterward applied to families, such as Johns, Walters, Thorns, Jacks, George, August, etc. To this class belong many names ending in &quot;son,&quot; indicating the son of the original bearer of the baptismal name; for instance, Thomson, Johnson, Wilson, Robinson, Jackson, Peterson, Oleson, Larson, and a long list of others. Also, those ending in &quot;kin&quot; which means &quot;little,&quot; as for instance; Tompkins, Atkins, Pushkin, etc. There are a number of similar prefixes and suffixes, of equal importance, as you may see by reference to the books on the subject on the shelves of your city library.
							</p>
							<p>
								Then come the large class of names indicating the trade or occupation of the founder of the family, as for instance: Baker, Brewer, Carpenter, Goldsmith, Cooper, Smith, Currier, Miller, Cook, Mason, Sawyer, Weaver, Hunter, Fisher, Fowler, Miner, Turner, Porter, Carver, Taylor, Barber, Tanner, Draper, Shepherd, Sadler, Carter, Gardner, etc. Then come the group indicating the personal qualities or characteristics of some old ancestor, such as Strong, Hardy, Noble, Bright, Gay, Merryman, Savage, Swift, Long, Short, Sharp, Sweet, Sauer, Sly, Spry, Weakling, etc. And, again, the group whose ancestors were given the names of animals, such as Fox, Hare, Wolf, Lyon, Hart, Buck, Bird, Finch, Parrot, Partridge, Drake, Gosling, Suckling, Hogg, Heron, Crane, etc. And, the near group, named after plants, as Wood, Root, Branch, Weed, Stump, Bush, Flower, Rose, Birch, Pine, Ash, Hazel, Oak, etc. Also, those whose forefathers were given the names of features of the landscape, as for instance, Hill, Dale, Field, Marsh, Lane, Rivers, Brooks, Forest, Vale, Mount, Mountain, Valley, Villa, Swamp, Bog. Also, those named after colors, Black, Brown, Blue, White, Scarlet, etc. Also those associated with size, as Long, Short, Little, Small. Also the Whiteheads, Blackheads, Redheads, Bigheads, Crookshanks, Bigfoots, Longarm&mdash;not quite so common, but yet found almost everywhere. Also those namedafter the place of birth of some ancestor, for instance, Boston, London, Berlin, Paris, Dublin, Madrid, Salsburg, Marburg, etc. We also find lists such as Pole, Stump, Post, Wood, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								The above lists might be multiplied indefinitely, but the above will serve to illustrate the principle. The names of persons, associated with the ideas of the thing which their name resembles, will be recalled much easier than names which have no such association, and which &quot;mean nothing&quot; but a group of letters. The nearer a name is capable of being pictured in the mind in the shape of an associated object of vision, the greater the case in recalling it. A study of names, beginning with the class of books mentioned by me a little further back in this lesson, and passing on to a study of directories, etc., will soon awaken an interest in names, and will lead to the perception of their association with other things, other names, and subjects. This will furnish a real associative value to the name, and will lead to its easier recollection.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you wish to create this interest in names, for the purposes mentioned, you should begin by &quot;thinking&quot; of a new name when you first hear it&mdash;trying to determine from what source the name arose (for all names had an origin and source, and did not spring into being spontaneously&mdash;the majority were applied practically as nicknames), and then associate it with its source, and classify it with other names known to you. The name &quot;Gould&quot; will be seen to have been derived from &quot;Gold,&quot; in all probability; and &quot;Watkinson&quot; will be recognized as meaning &quot;the son of little Walter&quot; i.e., &quot;Wat-(Walter) kin-(little) son.&quot; Before long, you will begin to take quite an interest in the classification of names, and will feel pleased when you discover a new, strange name, or else succeed in classifying a puzzling one. When that day comes, it will also find you becoming quite proficient in name-memorizing and name-recollection. Remember the old axiom: Memory is the child of attention, and the grandchild of interest.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some have found an aid in a kind of artificial or fanciful resemblance or association between names and things. For instance, the name &quot;Anthony&quot; has been thought of as linked with &quot;Ant and &quot;Cowper&quot; with &quot;Cow;&quot; &quot;Kingsley&quot; with &quot;King,&quot; and so on. Again, some peculiarity in the appearance of the person, has served to link his name to him, as for instance, a man named &quot;Redding&quot; had his name associated with his red hair; and one named &quot;Beek&quot; was remembered by reason of his large, hooked nose which was thought to resemble a bird's &quot;beak.&quot; These methods are fanciful and often forced, but they have a certain value in particular cases.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is generally easier to recall names with which we are quite familiar, than those of the opposite kind. In such cases there seems to be a kind of association set up between the already-known persons bearing the name, and the new person. This rule holds good even if we merely know the first persons by reputation, as for instance Washington, Grant, Dewey, Kitchener, Bismark, Gladstone, Joffre, Pooncaire, etc. Another form of name-association is that of a similarity in sound between the name and some well-known object, as for instance, Bunyan (bunion); Cushing (cushion); Medici (medicine); Prettiman (pretty-man); Summer (summer); Hocking (&quot;hocking&quot; slang for pawning); Stretch (stretch&mdash;&quot;to extend&quot;), etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								In memorizing a new name, it will be well to establish as many associations as possible for it&mdash;using the above suggestions, which will be found to be very useful in this connection, for the list includes practically all the approved methods. Try to hang it on as many hooks of association as possible. The very mental effort to find such hooks for it, tends to impress it more strongly upon the memory, it is well to remember. Also try to associate it with the time and place at which it was heard, and so far as possible with the person's appearance; also with the circumstances connected with the mention of the name. Bring up these associations, afterward, in connection with the name, for by so doing you make much easier the future recollection of the name&mdash;because you have strengthened the chain of association by so doing.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another good plan is that attributed by historians to Napoleon III, who was renowned for his excellent memory of names and persons. He had developed this memory by writing down on paper the name of the person whom he had just previously met, reading it aloud several times, and then destroying the paper. Re-writing a name several times, will serve to deepen the impression, as will also the speaking aloud of the name, several times, so that your ear-memory is impressed by the sound. A combination of the above mentioned two methods will be found to be an improvement upon either practiced separately.
							</p>
							<p>
								A very excellent method of acquiring an easy recognition of persons, and an identification of them with their names and vice versa, is that of taking a clear, searching look at the person when you first meet him, noting his features (see instruction of memorizing faces), and at the same time repeating his name. Always make a point of repeating a person's name, when you have had it mentioned to you&mdash;it pleases the person, and aids your memory. In thinking of the person afterward, always try to picture him in your mind, at the same time murmuring his name. Or, if you hear his name, try to picture the person. It is well to revive the impressions of persons and their names, in a sort of mental review, for by so doing you strengthen the original impression and association.
							</p>
							<p>
								But first, last, and all the time&mdash;manage to work up an interest in NAMES of persons, along the lines I have pointed out to you. If you want to be an expert on horses, you must study horses with interest&mdash;if you wish to be a proficient botanist, you must take an interest in plants. The interesting things are easily remembered. Therefore, take an interest in names, as names&mdash;study them&mdash;and you will become known as &quot;the man who never forgets a name once heard.&quot; This is an actual fact, and not mere fancy. You can do this thing, and will do it, providing you are willing to pay the price of working up an interest in the study of names, so that they will grow to &quot;mean something real&quot; to you when you hear them. Why, there are men who can take pleasure in studying the pages of a directory! Can you not see why? Can you imagine such men forgetting a name?
