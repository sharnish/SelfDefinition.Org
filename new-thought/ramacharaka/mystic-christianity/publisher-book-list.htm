								Mystic Christianity, by Yogi Ramacharaka</p>

								Publisher's Notice
							</p>
							<p>
								The lessons which compose this volume originally appeared in monthly form, the first of which was issued in October, 1907, and the twelfth in September, 1908. These lessons met with a hearty and generous response from the public, and the present volume is issued in response to the demand for the lessons in a permanent and durable form. There has been no change in the text.
							</p>
							<p>
								The publishers take the liberty to call the attention of the readers to the great amount of information condensed within the space of each lesson. Students have told us that they have found it necessary to read and study each lesson carefully, in order to absorb the varied information contained within its pages. They have also stated that they have found it advisable to re-read the lessons several times, allowing an interval between the readings, and that at each reading they would discover information that had escaped them during the course of the previous study. This has been repeated to us so often that we feel justified in mentioning it, that others may avail themselves of the same plan of study.
							</p>
							<p>
								Following his usual custom, the writer of this volume has declined to write a preface for this book, claiming that the lessons will speak for themselves, and that those for whom they are intended will receive the message contained within them without any prefatory talk.

								JESUS THE LAST GREAT INITIATE By EDOUARD SCHURE
							</h5>
							<p><a href="https://sacred-texts.com/eso/jlgi/index.htm">https://<wbr>sacred-texts.com/<wbr>eso/jlgi/<wbr>index.htm</a></p>
							<p>
								Mr. Schure in this volume, has done much to strengthen the belief that Jesus was an Essene, in whom a Messianic consciousness was awakened by special initiation.
							</p>
							<p>
								A remarkable full account is given of his experiences among the Essenes and how his early life, (about which the Bible is so reticent) was spent studying with the advanced Occult masters.
							</p>
							<p>
								The problem of how Jesus became the Messiah, he holds to be not capable of solution without the aid of intuition and esoteric tradition.
							</p>
							<p>
								The life of the great Teacher as pictured by the writer is one to be dreamed over and capable of imparting both knowledge and stimulus to that inner life which is in so many undeveloped and even unsuspected.

							<p>
								The lives and teachings of these two great Masters who preceded Jesus are very much like the latter's. You cannot help noting the remarkable resemblance they bear to each other.
							</p>
							<p>
								Krishna's Virgin Birth, His Youth, Initiation, The Doctrine of the Initiates, Triumph and Death, are all told in a fashion that shows that Mr. Schure has devoted much time to thought and research work. The mighty religious of India, Egypt and Greece are passed in rapid review and the author declares that while from the outside they present nothing but chaos, the root idea of their founders and prophets presents a key to them all.

							</p>
							<p>
								Write name of Books desired, plainly and fully.
							</p>
							<p>
								Write plainly your name, street address (if in city); town or city; and state. Don't forget the state, as there are many towns of the same name in the country--yours is only one of many.
							</p>
							<p>
								Send money by Post Office Money Order, or Express Money Order, or Registered Letter. This is the only Safe Way. If Personal Checks are sent add l0c extra for exchange.
							</p>
							<p>
								Write your own name and address on the upper left hand corner of the envelope (this saves many lost letters).
