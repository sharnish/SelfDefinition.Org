							<h3>
								1. Do Your Spiritual Practice Every Day
							</h3>
							<p>
								If you do <em>not</em> do your spiritual practice every day - eventually, sooner or later, your life will become full of suffering.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you do <em>not</em> do your spiritual practice every day - eventually, sooner or later, one or more of the thousands of different types of sorrow and suffering will enter your life.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you do <em>not</em> do your spiritual practice every day - you will continue to be caught in the cycle of birth and death, birth again, death again, birth again, death again and in that cycle, eventually, all of the thousands of forms that suffering takes will enter your life.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you do <em>not</em> do your spiritual practice every day - you will experience death, diseases, violence, loss of those you love and thousands of other types of suffering, lifetime after lifetime.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you <em>do</em> your spiritual practice every day - for the maximum amount of time you can create by dropping unnecessary activities - eventually all forms of suffering will end and you will live in Infinite-Eternal-Being-Awareness-Love-Bliss.
							</p>
							<p>
								The purpose of spiritual practice is to experience Infinite-Eternal-Being-Awareness-Love-Bliss in this lifetime, not in the afterlife or some future lifetime.
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									All delays are tricks of the ego.
								</p>
								<p>
									All detours are tricks of the imposter self.
								</p>
								<p>
									All distractions are tricks of the false pretend self.
								</p>
								<p>
									Every thought that leads you away from spiritual practice, is a trick created by the imposter.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								So look at your daily activities, and drop all those activities that are not necessary, to create the most time you can create for spiritual practice, and practice every day.
							</p>
							<p>
								Taking a shower every day is necessary. For most people, working to earn a living every day is necessary.
							</p>
							<p>
								Entertainment is not necessary.
							</p>
							<p>
								Make sure that the spiritual practice you are doing IS the most rapid means to:
							</p>
							<p class="blockquote">
								Infinite-Eternal-Being-Awareness-Love-Bliss
							</p>
							<h3>
								2. The Choice
							</h3>
							<p class="strong">
								You have a choice between A:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									Infinite-Eternal-Being-Awareness-Love-Bliss with zero suffering.
								</p>
								<p>
									Absolutely perfect Love-Bliss for all eternity.
								</p>
								<p>
									Living in and Knowing your True Self.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p class="strong">
								Or choice B:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									Thousands of forms of suffering, sorrow, violence, disease, death, over and over again, death-rebirth-death-rebirth.
								</p>
								<p>
									Living in and knowing an imposter self.
								</p>
								<p>
									Living from an acquired false self in the form of thought.
								</p>
								<p>
									Living from a parasite that pretends to be your self.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3>
								3. Making Choice A
							</h3>
							<p>
								Every day that you do your spiritual practice you are making choice A.
							</p>
							<p>
								Every day that you do not do your spiritual practice you are making choice B.
							</p>
							<p class="strong">
								To make choice A
							</p>
							<ol class="reminder">
								<li>
									<p>
										Read this Reminder Page every day. The pretend self is very tricky and tries to lead people away from spiritual practice. Reading this Reminder Page every day will help to combat the ego&apos;s tricks.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Every day look at your daily activities and drop all activities that are not really necessary. Every day create as much time as possible for spiritual practice.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Do your spiritual practice every day.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Every day you have a choice. You cannot do anything about yesterday's choices, therefore, do not worry about them. What you can do is:
							</p>
							<h4>
								Do your spiritual practice today.
							</h4>
							<h3>
								4. Awakening The Extremely Intense Desire For Liberation
							</h3>
							<p>
								Before the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, the false self will lead you to a practice that will promote more egotism.
							</p>
							<p>
								After the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will be lead to the spiritual practice that is the most rapid means to Infinite-Eternal-Being-Awareness-Love-Bliss.
							</p>
							<p>
								After the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will be able to see how the pretend self has contaminated all of the spiritual teachings of the past.
							</p>
							<p>
								Reading this reminder every day may be enough to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation in you.
							</p>
							<p>
								Self-honesty is a great help towards the awakening of the extremely intense desire for liberation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Watch the ego when it tries to lead you away from spiritual practice into distractions, detours, diversions, delays, unnecessary activities and entertainments, but do not let the ego win that battle.
							</p>
							<h3 style="text-align:center;">
