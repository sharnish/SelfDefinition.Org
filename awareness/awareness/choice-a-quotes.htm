								The following is a dialogue with Sri Ramana Maharshi from the book &quot;Letters from Sri Ramanasramam&quot; by Suri Nagamma

									<td>
										Who said you couldn&apos;t follow it? You can do so.
										<br /> But when you talk of love, there is duality, is there not? &ndash;
										the person who loves and the entity called God who is loved?
										<br /> The individual is not separate from God.
										<br /> Hence love means one has love towards one&apos;s own Self.
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>
										Q:
									</td>
									<td>
										That is why I am asking you whether God could be worshipped through the path of love.
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>
										RM:
									</td>
									<td>
										That is exactly what I have been saying.
										<br /> Love itself is the actual form of God.
										<br /> If by saying, &apos;I do not love this, I do not love that&apos;,
										<br /> you reject all things,
										<br /> that which remains is the real form of the Self.
										<br /> That is pure bliss.
										<br /> Call it pure bliss, God, Self, or what you will.
										<br /> That is devotion, that is realization and that is everything.
										<br /> If you thus reject everything, what remains is the Self alone.
										<br /> That is real love.
										<br /> One who knows the secret of that love
										<br /> finds the world itself full of universal love.
										<br />
										<br /> The experience of not forgetting consciousness, alone,
										<br /> is the state of devotion
										<br /> which is the relationship of unfading real love,
										<br /> because the real knowledge of Self,
										<br /> which shines as the undivided supreme bliss itself,
										<br /> surges up as the nature of love.
										<br />
										<br /> Only if one knows the truth of love,
										<br /> which is the real nature of Self,
										<br /> will the strong entangled knot of life be untied.
										<br /> Only if one attains the height of love will liberation be attained.
										<br />
										<br /> Such is the heart of all religions.
										<br /> The experience of Self is only love,
										<br /> which is seeing only love,
										<br /> hearing only love,
										<br /> feeling only love,
										<br /> tasting only love
										<br /> and smelling only love,
										<br /> which is bliss.

								The following is the preamble to the book &apos;Who am I&apos; by Sri Ramana Maharshi
							</p>

							<p class="blockquote">
								As all living beings desire to be happy always, without misery,
								<br /> as in the case of everyone there is observed supreme love for one's self,
								<br /> and as happiness alone is the cause for love,
								<br /> in order to gain that happiness which is one's nature
								<br /> and which is experienced in the state of deep sleep
								<br /> where there is no mind, one should know one's self.
								<br /> For that, the path of knowledge, the inquiry
								<br /> of the form "Who am I?", is the principal means."
