								Preliminary Instructions
							</h3>
							<p>
								The setting should be where you will be undisturbed. If you are at home when you
								practice you can ask your family members not to disturb you while you are practicing.
								You should be alone during your practice session. You can begin with a one hour
								or two hour practice session.
							</p>
							<p>
								There should be nothing you have to attend to during your practice sessions. There
								should be no other activities going on during your practice sessions. The time set
								aside for practice is for practice only.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you have children, it is best to have someone you trust watching your children
								during your practice sessions, so that you do not have to worry about them.
							</p>
							<p>
								Body posture is not important with The Abandon Release Method. You can do the practice
								laying down on your bed or you can do the practice sitting up.
							</p>
							<p>
								For your first practice session, laying down on your bed would be better. Laying
								down helps one to forget the body.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you do the practice sitting up, you can do the practice in a meditation posture
								with legs crossed if you find that comfortable. If you do not find that comfortable
								you can do the practice sitting in a chair or sitting on a couch.
							</p>
							<p>
								Whatever position causes no pain and is most comfortable is best.</p>
							<p>
								If you do the practice sitting, when you sit down you can sit with your spine straight.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, as soon as you begin the practice you should ignore your body posture and
								ignore your body.</p>
							<p>
								After practice begins, it does not matter what position your body is in.</p>
							<p>
								You can alternate, sometimes doing the practice laying down in your bed and sometimes
								doing the practice sitting up.</p>
							<p>
								The advantage of doing the practice laying down on your bed is that it is easier
								to forget the body in that position.</p>
							<p>
								The advantage of doing the practice sitting up is that gravity will assist in pulling
								your mind into your spiritual heart and that is one of the reasons why sitting up
								has been a posture recommended in the traditions of the past.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another advantage of doing the practice sitting up is that you are less likely to
								fall asleep during practice.</p>
							<p>
								Although you ignore the environment during the Abandon Release Method, ignoring
								smells, sounds, sights, and the body, if there is an emergency such as the smell
								of smoke or the sound of someone needing help or a painful body sensation indicating
								the need for attention, you should stop the practice and attend to what needs to
								be attended to.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thought and awareness are not the same. The following definitions for the word &quot;thought&quot;
								and for the word &quot;awareness&quot; should be used for the Abandon Release Method:</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thought:</em> Thoughts are the words of your native language in the mind. If
								your native language is English, and the language you think in is English, then
								thoughts are those English words in your mind. If you think in two languages, then
								thoughts are the words of those two languages in your mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Awareness:</em> When you wake up in the morning awareness is that consciousness
								that woke up in the morning. Thoughts come and thoughts go, but the background of
								awareness does not come and go. Awareness remains continuous during all the waking
								hours until you go to sleep at night. Awareness is you, your consciousness that
								is looking through your eyes right now. Feelings come and feelings go, but the background
								of awareness does not come and go.
							</p>
							<p>
								Awareness is you. There are not two, you and Awareness. There is only one. Awareness
								is another name for you. You wake up in the morning. Awareness wakes up in the morning.
								Two ways of saying the same thing. You were sleeping, now you wake up in the morning.
								What is the difference?
							</p>
							<p>
								The difference is you were not aware while sleeping. You wake up and now you are
								aware. You could call awareness awakeness. In deep sleep you are not aware of any
								thoughts or objects. You wake up and now you are aware of thoughts and objects or
								you are aware of the absence of thoughts and objects. That which allows you to perceive
								thoughts and objects or the absence of thoughts and objects is awareness.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the Abandon Release Method Practice the word consciousness and the word awareness
								have the same meaning.</p>
							<p class="strong">
								A suggestion for beginners:</p>
							<ul class="generic">
								<li>Practice for at least two hours per day, every day. </li>
								<li>Practice&nbsp; either in one two-hour session, or two one-hour sessions. </li>
								<li>Morning when you first wake up is best. </li>
								<li>Evening just before you go to sleep is second best. </li>
								<li>Descriptions (approaches) of how to use the Abandon Release Method are given below.
									Following the Descriptions, there is a recommended schedule for alternating among
									them.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Like any skill, you learn by practice. The longer you practice, the more enjoyable
								the practice becomes, after you have gained some skill in letting go. Some people
								will find it easy and enjoyable from the beginning. Other people will find it easy
								and enjoyable only after some weeks of practicing every day.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can make a recording of the practice instructions (The Descriptions A, B, C,
								D, E or F below) on an audiocassette or CD and then play them during your practice
								session, repeating the instructions on the recording after 30 minutes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Put the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on your bedroom door, turn out the lights, lay down
								on your bed. If laying down flat on your back gets tiresome at some point, you can
								turn over on your side.

								Other Methods
							</h4>
							<p>
								The Abandon Release Method is a whole and complete practice unto itself, and as
								long as you are satisfied with the new life the Abandon Release Method gives you,
								you need no other practice.</p>
							<p>
								There are two primary Direct and Rapid Means to Infinite-Eternal-Life-Awareness-Love-Bliss:</p>
							<p class="strong">
								One is the path of Surrender</p>
							<p>
								The Abandon Release Method is the most Direct and Rapid Means to Infinite-Eternal-Life-Awareness-Love-Bliss
								on the path of Surrender.</p>
							<p class="strong">
								The other is the path of Awareness</p>
							<p>
								The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the most Direct and Rapid Means to Infinite-Eternal-Life-Awareness-Love-Bliss
								on the Path of Awareness.</p>
							<p>
								The Awareness Watching Awareness Method is a whole and complete practice and as
								long as you are satisfied with the new life the Awareness Watching Awareness Method
								gives you, you need no other practice.</p>
							<p>

								link: <a href="awa-instructions.htm">
									AWA Practice Instructions</a>
							</p>


							<p>
								The <strong>Abandon Release Method</strong> is Passive.</p>
							<p>
