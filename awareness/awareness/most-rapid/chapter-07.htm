								Preliminary Instructions
							</h3>
							<ol class="book">
								<li>Set aside as much time every day to practice the Awareness Watching Awareness Method as you are willing to set aside. </li>
								<li>Every day, drop as many unnecessary activities as you are willing to drop to create more time for the Awareness Watching Awareness Method practice. </li>
								<li>If you are not willing to drop all unnecessary activities in order to create the maximum amount of time every day for practice, then you can read Chapter Five and Chapter Thirteen every day until the extremely intense desire for liberation awakens in you. </li>
								<li>Eating food and taking a shower are examples of necessary activities. </li>
								<li>For some people working to earn a living is an example of a necessary activity.
								</li>
								<li>For some people taking care of their children is an example of a necessary activity.
								</li>
								<li>Examples of unnecessary activities are entertainment, hobbies, etc. </li>
								<li>Practice for at least two hours every day. </li>
								<li>If you are retired and can practice for twelve hours every day, that would be much more effective. </li>

							</ol>
							<!-- break between 9 and 10, double digits -->
							<ol start="10" class="book-double">

								<li>It is better if you can be undisturbed during your practice. </li>
								<li>If you practice at home you can ask the people you live with not to disturb you when you are practicing unless there is an emergency. </li>
								<li>Or you can find some other place to practice where you will be not be disturbed.
								</li>
								<li>Bodily posture is not important in the Awareness Watching Awareness Method.
								</li>
								<li>However, since one wishes to turn the attention away from the body, it is important that the body is comfortable and relaxed and not causing any pain or strain.
								</li>
								<li>You can do the practice sitting crossed legged or sitting on a chair or sitting on a sofa or couch or even laying down on your bed if you are able to do so without falling asleep. </li>
								<li>Make sure the posture is comfortable and does not cause any pain, strain or discomfort.
								</li>
								<li>Make sure the posture helps you to ignore the body and turn your attention away from the body. </li>
								<li>For the purposes of this practice the following definitions for the words awareness and thought must be used: </li>
								<li>Thought (19 - 21): Thoughts are the words of your native language in your mind.
								</li>
								<li>If your native language is English and the language you think in is English, thoughts are those English words in your mind. </li>
								<li>If you think in two languages, then thoughts are the words of those two languages in your mind. </li>
								<li>Awareness (22 - 46): When you wake up in the morning, awareness is that consciousness that woke up in the morning. </li>
								<li>Thoughts come and thoughts go, but the background of awareness remains continuous during all the waking hours until you go to sleep at night. </li>
								<li>Awareness is you, your awareness, just your awareness that is looking through your eyes right now. </li>
								<li>The words awareness, consciousness, attention, observation, watching, looking, seeing and concentrating all have the same meaning in the practice instructions. </li>
								<li>Awareness is not thought. </li>
								<li>Awareness is that which is aware of thought. </li>
								<li>Both when there are thoughts and when there are no thoughts, the awareness that woke up in the morning is aware, because the awareness that woke up in the morning is continuous during all of the waking hours until you go to sleep. </li>
								<li>Awareness is not emotions. </li>
								<li>Awareness is that which is aware of emotions. </li>
								<li>Both when there are emotions and when there are no emotions, the awareness that woke up in the morning is there, because the awareness that woke up in the morning is continuous during all of the waking hours until you go to sleep again. </li>
								<li>Awareness is not the objects seen by the eyes. </li>
								<li>Awareness is that which is aware of the objects seen by the eyes. </li>
								<li>The awareness that woke up in the morning is there when the eyes are open seeing objects and when the eyes are closed not seeing objects, because the background of awareness is continuous during all the waking hours until you go to sleep again.
								</li>
								<li>Awareness is not the thought &apos;I&apos;. </li>
								<li>Awareness is that which is aware of the thought &apos;I&apos;. </li>
								<li>Both when one thinks &apos;I&apos; and when one does not think &apos;I&apos;, the awareness that woke up in the morning is there, because the background of awareness is continuous during all the waking hours until you go to sleep again. </li>
								<li>Awareness is not desire. </li>
								<li>Awareness is that which is aware of desire. </li>
								<li>Both when there is desire and when there is no desire, the awareness that woke up in the morning is there, because the background of awareness is continuous until you go to sleep again. </li>
								<li>Awareness is not something far off, lofty or mysterious. </li>
								<li>Awareness is that which is looking through your eyes reading this. </li>
								<li>Just your ordinary, every day awareness. </li>
								<li>Not some special awareness. </li>
								<li>Awareness is that which wakes up in the morning and remains aware until you go to sleep at night </li>
								<li>Awareness is not any of the things or experiences perceived. </li>
								<li>Try an experiment (48 - 52): </li>
								<li>Look at an object in the room. </li>
								<li>Notice the awareness that is looking through your eyes. </li>
								<li>Now shut your eyes and notice that you are still aware. </li>
								<li>It is the same awareness that a moment ago was looking at the room. </li>
								<li>Now, with your eyes still closed observe your awareness. </li>
								<li>The following practice instructions are the Awareness Watching Awareness Method described using carefully chosen slightly different wording. </li>
								<li>It is important to use as few words as possible to describe the practice. </li>
								<li>Use only one description per practice session. </li>
								<li>If you are going to be practicing for one or two or three hours today, then for that entire time you should be using only one description. </li>
								<li>Try Description A first. </li>
								<li>Try a different description each day until you have tried all of them. </li>
								<li>Then choose the description that was easiest for you to understand and to practice, and from then on use only that description. </li>
								<li>Some descriptions might for a moment have you start with your eyes open, but once you are instructed to close your eyes, then keep your eyes closed. </li>
								<li>In other words, the Awareness Watching Awareness Method is always practiced with the eyes closed. </li>
								<li>When you are observing your awareness, just remain with that. </li>
								<li>There is no need to do anything else. </li>
								<li>Awareness is empty, there is no object you are trying to observe. </li>
								<li>It is just awareness being aware of itself. </li>
								<li>It is not a special kind of awareness. </li>
								<li>It is just your ordinary every day awareness that you normally go through the day with, looking at itself. </li>
								<li>You can record the descriptions below on an audiocassette or CD for personal use.
								</li>
								<li>Record only one description per recording. </li>
								<li>It is important to listen to only one description during a practice session.
								</li>
								<li>It is better not to interrupt your practice session by having to turn your recording off. </li>
								<li>That is why it is best to record only one description per recording. </li>
								<li>Repeat the same description on the recording every 30 minutes. </li>
