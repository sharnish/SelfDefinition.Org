								<li>If your ego will not allow you to practice the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, the Abandon Release Method is the second best choice. </li>

								<li>Therefore, if your ego will allow you to practice it, the Awareness Watching Awareness Method should be your first choice. </li>
								<li>If one looks at the thousands of spiritual practices that have been taught to humans in the past, the Awareness Watching Awareness Method is the most rapid and direct means to bringing sorrow, suffering and the ego to its final end, here and now in this lifetime. </li>

								<li>The Abandon Release Method is easier to practice than the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, even when you are tired or sleepy. </li>
								<li>If your ego will not allow you to practice the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, you could practice the Abandon Release Method for one year and then try switching to the Awareness Watching Awareness Method and then remaining with the Awareness Watching Awareness Method. </li>

								<li>Or you could continue practicing the Abandon Release Method for as many years as you wish to practice it. </li>
								<li>You should practice one or the other, the Awareness Watching Awareness Method or the Abandon Release Method, for the rest of your life. </li>
								<li>The reason practice should continue for as long as the body lives is (13 - 16):
								</li>
								<li>There is a false state of liberation, where the ego has not come to its final end, but has only been temporarily submerged consciously in the infinite awareness.
								</li>
								<li>This temporary state is very similar to liberation, there is no sorrow and no suffering and one only has the experience of infinite awareness love bliss. </li>
								<li>One in this temporary state will usually have the perception that they have been liberated. </li>
								<li>However, one in this temporary state has not been liberated. </li>
								<li>That (13 - 16) is the reason that one should practice for as long as the body lives, even if one has the perception that one has been liberated. </li>
								<li>The preliminary instructions for the Abandon Release Method are the same as the preliminary instructions for the Awareness Watching Awareness Method. </li>
								<li>See Chapter Seven for the preliminary instructions. </li>
								<li>In the beginning, the best position for practice of the Abandon Release Method is laying down on your bed. </li>
								<li>After you have practiced the Abandon Release Method many times, then you could try the practice sitting up. </li>
								<li>After you have practiced the Abandon Release Method many times in both positions, sitting up and laying down, you can choose the position you like best and continue to practice in that position. </li>
								<li>The following is a suggested schedule for using the Descriptions (39 - 44 in the Practice Instructions below) : </li>
								<li>Start by using the Description D practice instructions for the first month.
								</li>
								<li>Use Description E for the second month. </li>
								<li>Use Description A for the third month. </li>
								<li>Use Description B for the fourth month. </li>
								<li>Use Description A (again) for the fifth month. </li>
								<li>Begin using Description C and continue with it for one to four years. </li>
								<li>Once per month, as a reminder, for one practice session, use description A.
								</li>
								<li>After one to four years of practice, you may be so familiar with the practice, that Description F is all you need. </li>
								<li>Like any skill, the more you practice, the more skill you gain. </li>
								<li>The longer you practice the more enjoyable the practice becomes, after you have gained some skill in letting go. </li>
								<li>Some people will find the Abandon Release Method practice enjoyable from the beginning.
								</li>
								<li>Other people will find the practice easy and enjoyable only after many weeks of practicing every day. </li>
								<li>You can make a recording of the practice instructions (Descriptions A, B, C, D, E or F) on an audio cassette or CD and then play them during your practice session, repeating the instructions on the recording after 30 minutes. Pause for one minute between each sentence when making the recording. </li>
								<li>Put the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on your bedroom door, turn out the lights, lay down on your bed. </li>
								<li>If laying down flat on your back becomes tiresome at some point, you can turn over on your side. </li>
