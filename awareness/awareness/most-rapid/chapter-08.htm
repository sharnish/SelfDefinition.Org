								<li>These further clarifications appear in a separate chapter because the practice instructions for the Awareness Watching Awareness Method are simple and they should remain simple.
								</li>
								<li>It is not helpful to bring concepts with you into the practice. </li>
								<li>It is best just to focus on the simple practice instructions. </li>
								<li>One of the things you might wonder is what to do after you start watching your awareness.
								</li>
								<li>There is nothing else to be done. </li>
								<li>You just continue with awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>There are no objects to see. </li>
								<li>Awareness is empty, there is no thing to observe there. </li>
								<li>Just continue for the entire practice session watching your awareness. Only awareness watching awareness and nothing else. </li>

								<li>Don&apos;t expect any type of experience. </li>
								<li>If you are wondering if you will have some kind of spiritual experience, then that very wondering means you have added something to awareness watching awareness.
								</li>
								<li>Never add anything to awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>The key is to be content just watching your awareness and not to move from that and not to add anything to that. </li>
								<li>You may or may not have some kind of spiritual experience. However, you should never be expecting any kind of spiritual experience. </li>
								<li>If you wonder if the state is going to deepen, that very wondering means you have added something to the Awareness Watching Awareness practice. </li>
								<li>Never add anything to the Awareness Watching Awareness Method. </li>
								<li>Just be content with awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>You should look at it like awareness watching awareness is all there is, there is nothing more. </li>
								<li>In the Awareness Watching Awareness Method practice, you are not seeking anything.
								</li>
								<li>You are observing, not seeking. </li>
								<li>If you were seeking something, then there would be seeking and awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>That would mean you would have added seeking to the awareness watching awareness practice. </li>
								<li>Never add anything to the awareness watching awareness practice. Just be content to continue with awareness watching awareness without adding anything to it.
								</li>
								<li>The best practice session is when there are no thoughts. </li>
								<li>If there are thoughts, turn your attention away from the thoughts and towards awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>Do not encourage thoughts. </li>
								<li>Do not try to complete a thought. </li>
								<li>Do not turn your attention towards thoughts. </li>
								<li>Do not think about thinking. </li>
								<li>If thoughts are happening, do not make a problem out of it. Just turn your attention away from thoughts and towards awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>Just remain with awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>When awareness is watching awareness something extraordinary is happening. </li>
								<li>You are for the first time turning inward. </li>
								<li>Your true nature is awareness. </li>
								<li>What you really are at your core is awareness. </li>
								<li>Therefore, in awareness watching awareness, you are for the first time observing yourself and knowing yourself. </li>
								<li>However, you should not think about that or anything else written in this chapter while practicing awareness watching awareness, because then you would be adding those thoughts to the practice. </li>
								<li>It is being pointed out that you are doing something extraordinary when awareness is watching awareness because at first you might think: &quot;what else?&quot; or &quot;so what?&quot;.
								</li>
								<li>Just continue to practice and forget about &quot;what else?&quot; or &quot;so what?&quot;. </li>
								<li>Just by turning your attention away from thought and towards awareness watching awareness, you are doing something that will change your life completely if you are sincere and continue to practice. </li>
								<li>Most humans live their entire lives always looking outward at people, places and things. </li>
								<li>By turning your attention away from the world, body and thought, and towards awareness watching awareness, you are doing something extraordinary. </li>
								<li>For some people it might take a few days, others a few weeks and others a few months to start to feel something. </li>
								<li>At first it is subtle and you won&apos;t know what it is, but you will know that you like it. </li>
								<li>It is pleasant. </li>
								<li>A new subtle feeling. </li>
								<li>You are beginning to feel: eternal life-love-peace. </li>
								<li>However, you should not have any expectations about that, because if you expect that, then you are adding that expectation to your awareness watching awareness practice. </li>
								<li>Never add anything to your awareness watching awareness practice. </li>
								<li>Just remain in awareness watching awareness while ignoring all else. </li>
								<li>Just stay there. </li>
								<li>Just remain in that. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t look for something else. </li>
								<li>While you are practicing the Awareness Watching Awareness Method (55 - 89):
								</li>
								<li>Just stay there. </li>
								<li>Relax with that. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t seek something other than awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t seek any other state. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t seek deeper awareness. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t seek anything. </li>
								<li>Just remain in awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>Be happy that it is simple. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t seek more than that. </li>
								<li>It is just a simple state. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t seek peace. </li>
								<li>Let peace come on its own if it is going to come, without your expecting or seeking it. </li>
								<li>Just remain with awareness watching awareness, and every time a thought arises, turn your awareness away from the thought and towards awareness watching awareness.
								</li>
								<li>Just continue to practice every day. </li>
								<li>Look at it as though all you were seeking was the awareness watching awareness itself and not something else. Therefore, be content with just staying in awareness watching awareness without moving from it. </li>
								<li>Some days the mind may be noisy, but if you keep on practicing, a good day will appear when your practice will go very deep without your trying to make it go deep.
								</li>
								<li>Never think about deep or not deep. </li>
								<li>If you think about deep or not deep you would be adding something to the awareness watching awareness practice. </li>
								<li>Just be content to remain with awareness watching awareness regardless of whether it seems like a good practice session or not. </li>
								<li>Some days your emotions may be turbulent. </li>
								<li>Just ignore the turbulent feelings and turn your attention away from the turbulent emotions and towards awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>If you continue practicing the Awareness Watching Awareness Method every day, eventually you will start to enjoy awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>How long it will take to begin enjoying awareness watching awareness is different for different people. </li>
								<li>For some people it may take days, others weeks and others months. </li>
								<li>The point is, if you find it difficult to remain with awareness watching awareness in the beginning, don&apos;t give up, practice every day on the good days and on the noisy mind or turbulent feeling days also. </li>
								<li>Just continue turning your attention away from thoughts and towards awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>You should not be expecting the day when you will start to enjoy awareness watching awareness, because then you would be adding something to the awareness watching awareness practice in the form of an expectation. </li>
								<li>The best kind of awareness watching awareness practice is one that is empty.
								</li>
								<li>Just awareness watching awareness and nothing else. </li>
								<li>Just stay there. </li>
								<li>Just be there. </li>
								<li>Just dwell there. </li>
								<li>Just remain there. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t seek anything different, just be content with awareness watching awareness.
								</li>
								<li>Just relax and continue watching your awareness. </li>
								<li>Here is a way to look at it: </li>
								<li>Awareness watching awareness is a little like falling in love. </li>
								<li>You spend time with someone. </li>
								<li>You watch them. You observe them. </li>
								<li>But you do not yet know them. </li>

							</ol>
							<!-- break between 99 and 100, triple digits -->
							<ol start="100" class="book-triple">

								<li>You continue to observe them. </li>
								<li>You don&apos;t have expectations, because you don&apos;t know them well enough yet to have expectations. </li>
								<li>You just keep on observing. </li>
								<li>Some days you have pleasant feelings while you observe them. </li>
								<li>Some days you have unpleasant feelings while you observe them. </li>
								<li>You continue to observe them. </li>
								<li>Every day you are coming to know them better, even though you may not be aware that you are coming to know them better. </li>
								<li>Then one day suddenly and unexpectedly, you have fallen in Love. </li>
								<li>Awareness watching awareness is a little like that. </li>
								<li>Just don&apos;t expect anything, and continue watching your awareness. </li>
								<li>The fact that nothing is happening is great! </li>
								<li>If it seems like day after day it is just the same, only awareness watching awareness, that is great! </li>
								<li>Just remain content with that. </li>
								<li>If you think it is going to change, then you are adding something to awareness watching awareness, in the form of an expectation that it is going to change. </li>
								<li>Just look at awareness watching awareness as enough, just as it is. </li>
								<li>Continue your practice every day. </li>
								<li>When will you fall in love with awareness watching awareness? </li>
								<li>It may be after one month or after many months of practice. </li>
								<li>You will have plenty of confirmation along the way. </li>
								<li>Once you have started to experience even a little joy or peace from awareness watching awareness, the practice progresses very rapidly after that. </li>
								<li>It does not take long to reach the point where just closing your eyes brings awareness-joy to you even before you have started the practice. </li>
								<li>You should not expect it, because then you have added something to the Awareness Watching Awareness Method. </li>
								<li>Some people might not like the practice for the first week or two. </li>
								<li>Just persevere and keep practicing. </li>
								<li>You can look upon your awareness as something that wants you to watch it without expecting anything from it, like someone who wants to be loved just for what they are and not for what they can give you. </li>
								<li>Just continue to watch awareness, and don&apos;t be expecting peace-love-joy. </li>
								<li>Let peace-love-joy come on its own, without your expecting it. </li>
								<li>What you truly are is: Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Bliss-Love. </li>
								<li>However, by having your attention turned towards the world, the body and thought all the time, you imagine you are a body subject to disease, death and suffering.
								</li>
								<li>By turning your attention towards awareness, you are for the first time observing what you are. </li>
								<li>When you practice, do not think about what you are. </li>
								<li>Just watch your awareness without expecting anything. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t watch your thoughts. </li>
								<li>Turn your attention away from your thoughts and watch your empty awareness.
								</li>
								<li>Observe the observing. </li>
								<li>Observe the awareness. </li>
								<li>If you remain content with just awareness watching awareness, eventually your problems will start to disappear. </li>
								<li>Your misery will start to disappear. </li>
								<li>Peace will come unexpectedly. </li>
								<li>Joy will come unexpectedly. </li>
								<li>Infinite Love will come unexpectedly. </li>
								<li>Awareness watching awareness is awareness being awareness. </li>
								<li>Because of the long ancient habit of looking outward towards people, places and things, the word &quot;watching&quot; is used in some of the practice instructions. </li>
								<li>One takes that same habit of watching people, places, and things and shuts the eyes and turns it inwards towards awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>That is why the word watching is used in some of the practice instructions.
								</li>
								<li>What is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. </li>
								<li>What is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people, places and things.
								</li>
								<li>Looking outward brings suffering, death and futility. </li>
								<li>Watching thoughts is not looking inward. </li>
								<li>Watching feelings is not looking inward. </li>
								<li>Watching breathing is not looking inward. </li>
								<li>Only turning the attention away from the observed and towards the observer is looking inward. </li>
								<li>Only awareness watching awareness is looking inward. </li>
								<li>Looking inward is liberation. </li>
								<li>Looking inward is eternal life. </li>
								<li>Looking inward is eternal awareness. </li>
								<li>Looking inward is eternal peace. </li>
								<li>Looking inward is eternal joy. </li>
								<li>Looking inward is eternal Love that is absolutely perfect and free of all forms of sorrow and misery. </li>
								<li>That joy, that perfection is your awareness. </li>
								<li>Because you always looked outward, you never experienced it. </li>
								<li>To change this long habit of looking outward you need to practice every day.
								</li>
								<li>Spend as many hours every day practicing as you can. </li>
								<li>If you only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very quickly.
								</li>
								<li>If you want rapid results, drop all your unnecessary activities to create the maximum amount of time you can spare to practice for many hours per day, every day. </li>
								<li>Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can devote the whole day (8 to 12 hours) to practicing the Awareness Watching Awareness Method. </li>
								<li>To come to know, experience and live in Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss is definitely worth the time spent practicing. </li>
								<li>You will discover you are not a body living in a world. </li>
								<li>You are eternal awareness, perfect love-joy. </li>
								<li>Remember to be content with just awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>Don&apos;t expect any of the experiences described in this chapter. Expectation will destroy the effectiveness of the practice. </li>
								<li>If it seems boring the first few times you try the awareness watching awareness practice, that is OK. Continue to practice. </li>
