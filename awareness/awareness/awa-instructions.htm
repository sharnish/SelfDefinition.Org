								The Preliminary Instructions
							</h3>
							<p>
								Set aside as much time each day to practice the Awareness Watching Awareness Method
								as you are willing to set aside.
							</p>
							<p>
								Drop as many unnecessary activities as you are willing to drop, to free up more
								time for awareness watching awareness practice.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is better if you can be undisturbed during your practice.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you practice at home you can ask those whom you live with not to disturb you
								when you are meditating, unless there is an emergency. Or you can find some other
								place to practice where you will be undisturbed. If you can&apos;t do that, well of course,
								go ahead and practice anyway.</p>
							<p>
								Bodily posture is not important in the Awareness Watching Awareness Method. However,
								since one wishes to turn the attention away from the body, it is important that
								the body be comfortable and relaxed and not causing any pain or strain.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can do the practice sitting crossed legged or sitting on a chair or sitting
								on a sofa or couch or even lying down on your bed if you are able to do so without
								falling asleep. Whatever is comfortable and does not cause any pain, strain or discomfort.
								Whatever posture helps you to ignore the body and turn the attention away from the
								body.</p>
							<p>
								For the purposes of this practice the following definitions for the words awareness
								and thought must be used.</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thought</em>: Thoughts are the words of your native language in the mind. If
								your native language is English, and the language you think in is English, then
								thoughts are those English words in your mind. If you think in two languages, then
								thoughts are the words of those two languages in your mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Awareness</em>: When you wake up in the morning, awareness is that consciousness
								that woke up in the morning. Thoughts come and thoughts go, but the background of
								awareness remains continuous during all the waking hours until you go to sleep at
								night. Awareness is you, your awareness, just your awareness that is looking through
								your eyes right now.
							</p>
							<p>
								The words Awareness, consciousness, attention, observation, watching, looking, seeing
								and concentrating all have the same meaning.</p>
							<p>
								Try an experiment:</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									Just look at an object in the room.<br />
									Notice the awareness that is looking through your eyes.<br />
									Now shut your eyes and notice that you are still aware.<br />
									It is the same awareness that was a moment ago looking at the room.<br />
									Now, with your eyes still closed, observe your awareness.</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								The following practice instructions are the Awareness Watching Awareness Method
								described, using carefully chosen slightly different wording.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is important to use as few words as possible to describe the practice. Use only
								one description per meditation session. If you are going to be practicing for one
								or two or three hours today, then for that entire time you should be using only
								one set of instructions.</p>
							<p>
								Try Description A first. If A is easy for you to understand and practice, there
								is no reason to go to B or C or D. A is enough. However if you do not understand
								the instruction then the next day you could try B.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some versions might for a moment have you start with your eyes open, but once you
								are instructed to close them, then keep them closed. In other words, the Awareness
								Watching Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed.</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									When you are observing your awareness, just remain with that.<br />
									No need to do anything else.
									<br />
									Awareness is empty, so there is no object you are trying to observe.
									<br />
									It is just awareness being aware of itself.<br />
									Also it is no special kind of awareness, it is just your ordinary every day awareness
									that you normally go through the day with, looking at itself.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								You can record the instructions below on an audiocassette or CD for personal use
								if you wish. The best way to do this is to only record one description, description
								A for example. It is important to listen to only one description during a meditation
								session. Otherwise you would be bringing in too many words and too many concepts.
								You do not wish to interrupt your practice session by having to turn a tape recorder
								off either. That is why it is best to record only one description, if you decide
								to record it. Repeat the instructions on the recording every 30 minutes.

							<p>
								The Abandon Release Method is a whole and complete practice, and as long as you
								are satisfied with the new life the Abandon Release Method gives you, you need no
								other practice.</p>
