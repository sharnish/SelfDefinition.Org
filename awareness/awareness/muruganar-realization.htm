								Sri Muruganar first met Sri Ramana Maharshi in 1923. On a subsequent visit to Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Ramana answered Sri Muruganar&apos;s pleas for Grace by directing His Divine Look at him. Under this penetrating Gaze, Sri Muruganar lost his delusions and found himself restored to his natural state of Self-awareness. The experience was permanent for Sri Muruganar. The ego and limited human consciousness never returned and the Infinite-Bliss-Love-Awareness remained forever.

								I find that reading the Sri Ramana experience above, on paper, sitting in a comfortable position on a sofa or couch or even lying down, greatly enhances the experience. Also, reading very slowly enhances the experience. Sri Muruganar&apos;s words have a unique power to convey experience. If you read the Sri Ramana Experience, just as you find it above, all of it, at least once per week, you may find a beautiful change occurring in your consciousness.
