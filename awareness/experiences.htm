								In January of 2004 after two years of practicing awareness watching awareness, the
								illusion of the ego ended. Gone forever, never to return.
							</p>
							<p>
								What remained is Infinite-eternal-awareness-bliss-love aware only of Infinite-eternal-awareness-bliss-love.
								Five words that point to that which is one and does not change.
							</p>
							<p>
								The practice instructions for the Awareness Watching Awareness method can be read
								at this link:
							</p>
							<p class="page-link"><a href="awa-instructions.htm">
									AWA Instructions</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								What follows is a report of what happened during those two years of practice:
							</p>
							<p>
								A quote by Sri Muruganar from Garland of Guru's (Sri Ramana Maharshi's) Sayings:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									1038. "Awareness is not a quality of the Self. The Self is without qualities. Awareness
									is not an action of the Self. The Self does nothing. The Self, our Being, IS Awareness."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								A quote by Sri Ramana Maharshi from Day by Day with Bhagavan:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									"You are awareness. Awareness is another name for you. All that you have to do is
									to give up being aware of other things; that is, of the not-Self. If one gives up
									being aware of them, then pure awareness alone remains, and that is the Self."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								Self Awareness is: Awareness of Awareness.
							</p>
							<p>
								This discovery, translated into practice as awareness watching awareness, was a
								great blessing for me.</p>
							<p>
								I was trying to find a clear easy way of understanding and practicing Sri Ramana
								Maharshi's and Sri Nisargadatta's instructions regarding focusing the attention
								on I or I AM.
							</p>
							<p>
								The awareness watching awareness discovery solved everything.
							</p>
							<p>
								I wrote about the details of what lead up to that, including practice instructions
								here:
							</p>
							<p class="page-link"><a href="awa-discovery.htm">
									AWA Discovery</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								That discovery was back in December of 2001. The following is a brief report on
								the progression of the actual practice of awareness watching awareness:
							</p>
							<p>
								In the beginning of the practice, Sri Muruganar's quotes regarding refraining from
								looking at thought, the body, the world etc., and instead turning the awareness
								towards awareness watching awareness were helpful.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because the habit of looking outward is so strong, reading these practice instructions
								and then actually practicing them was helpful:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									<a href="inquiry-abidance.htm">
										Inquiry - Abidance (Jan 2004 version of AWA Instructions)</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="muruganar-the-world.htm">
										The World (108 sayings on turning away from the world) - from Garland of Guru's
										Sayings by Sri Muruganar</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="ramana-think-read-discuss.htm">
										Ramana Maharshi on Thinking About, Reading &amp; Discussing Spiritual Teachings</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="muruganar-turning-inward.htm">
										Turning Inward - from Garland of Guru's Sayings by Sri Muruganar</a>
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								There were other things that were helpful to read such as descriptions of liberation
								which helped increase the desire for liberation and quotes by Sri Ramana Maharshi,
								Sri Annamalai Swami, Sri Muruganar and Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj that encouraged
								intense, constant, continuous practice.
							</p>
							<p>
								I won't list all those links here, they can all be found on this page:
							</p>
							<p class="page-link">
								<a href="five-sages.htm">Five Sages Teaching the Direct Path</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								As the practiced progressed there was far less reading.
							</p>
							<p>
								Very rapidly the practice simplifies and it is just awareness watching awareness.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the beginning it took a lot of effort to turn the attention away from thought,
								the body, the world, etc., towards awareness watching awareness, due to the long
								habit of looking outward.
							</p>
							<p>
								Awareness watching awareness is not just keeping quiet. One can keep quiet and still
								be looking outward.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are not two awarenesses, one watching the other. Awareness watching awareness
								is only one awareness watching itself.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								Awareness watching awareness is the perfect practice.
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									It instantly becomes awareness of awareness<br />
									which instantly becomes abiding as awareness,<br />
									which instantly becomes being awareness.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								Or one might say:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									awareness watching awareness<br />
									is really awareness of awareness<br />
									which is really abiding as awareness<br />
									which is really being awareness.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								I prefer to shut the eyes. Because the habit of abiding as awareness is there, upon
								shutting the eyes, there it is.
							</p>
							<p>
								Instant abidance.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just awareness by itself.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								As the practice progresses, it becomes simpler.
							</p>
							<p>
								One just abides as awareness.
							</p>
							<p>
								Awareness only.
							</p>
							<p>
								No thought, no body, no world, no universe.
							</p>
							<p>
								As Sri Ramana describes it in Talk 17:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									Questioner: "Does Maharshi enter the nirvikalpa samadhi?"
								</p>
								<p>
									Sri Ramana: "If the eyes are closed, it is nirvikalpa; if open, it is (though differentiated,
									still in absolute repose) savikalpa. The ever-present state is the natural state
									sahaja."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								If the attention is turned inward away from the body, thought, world, universe,
								etc. and towards awareness watching awareness it does not take long to realize that
								I am that awareness that lives forever.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								Thinking will not help. One has to feel the eternal life within, for the fear of
								ending the human known to disappear. Awareness watching awareness makes one aware
								of that feeling after only a little practice.
							</p>
							<p>
								Having felt that eternal life within, one wants only that, and the desire for an
								imaginary bodily existence that is really a kind of death and not life at all, disappears.
							</p>
							<p>
								Or as Sri Ramana described it:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									"So I am the spirit transcending the body. The body dies but the Spirit transcending
									it cannot be touched by death. That means I am the deathless Spirit."
								</p>
								<p>
									"All this was not dull thought; it flashed through me vividly as living truth which
									I perceived directly..."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								It begins just as a subtle feeling, then rapidly it emerges as the Reality.
							</p>
							<p>
								That subtle feeling can be felt after only a little time spent turning within towards
								awareness watching awareness. Maybe from the very first time one attempts it, or
								maybe after a few attempts.</p>
							<p>
								Because of the long habit of looking outward and calling a dream reality, it is
								good to continue to look inward long after one's first glimpse-feeling-awareness
								of what one really is.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								Knowing who one really is, is to remain without any sorrow, suffering, disease or
								death.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thus one trades in this limited imagination for Infinite-Eternal-Being-Awareness-Bliss-Love-Peace
								and those are not seven, that is just one.
							</p>
							<p>
								The solution to the fear of losing the known (imagining oneself to be a body living
								in a world) is just to turn inward, to cease looking outward at a world, body and
								thought and towards awareness watching awareness.
							</p>
							<p>
								The ending of the fear comes with the experience. Some experience comes very quickly.
								One begins to feel the eternal life within. As that feeling grows, the worry about
								losing what one formerly called life, which was not life at all, disappears.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								If one just starts turning inward towards awareness watching awareness, there is
								nothing one need think about.
							</p>
							<p>
								One falls in love with empty awareness, and discovers I am empty awareness, then
								"I am" disappears and one remains as: being-awareness.
							</p>
							<p>
								That being-awareness is eternal life.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just see the beauty of it!
							</p>
							<p>
								Being-Awareness is: Awareness.
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>

								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								There is no thought, no body, no world and no universe in that awareness.
							</p>
							<p>
								Although empty of all these, it is full.
							</p>
							<p>
								Full-whole-complete-perfect-Awareness.
							</p>
							<p>
								The practice took some time.
							</p>
							<p>
								However the end of the ego happened in just an instant.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								The above is the progress report.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here is a brief commentary:
							</p>
							<p>
								Due to the fear of ending the known, almost no human wishes to end the human known.
							</p>
							<p>
								In almost all humans the desire to preserve the ego illusion is trillions of times
								greater than the desire to end the ego illusion.
							</p>
							<p>
								This includes those humans who study, think about and discuss spiritual topics.
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, having a means to end the ego illusion which is extremely quick rapid
								and Direct, really does not matter, until the desire for liberation is awakened.
							</p>
							<p>
								Pretending that it has been awakened when it has not been awakened, while the fear
								of ending the known is still there, does not help to awaken it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Self honesty does help.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								There are thousands of relevant quotes by Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Muruganar, Sri
								Sadhu Om, Sri Annamalai Swami and Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and I will continue to
								add them to the Direct Path Links Directory [Five Sages page].
							</p>
							<p>
								Awareness watching awareness was taught by Ramana Maharshi, Sri Muruganar, Sri Sadhu
								Om , Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and Sri Annamalai Swami.
							</p>
							<p>
								Ceasing to think about such quotes, and instead taking one at a time, and not moving
								from it until it has been put into practice, is a powerful key.
							</p>
							<p>
								One might read such a quote many times with no effect, because the extremely intense
								desire for liberation has not yet been awakened.
							</p>
							<p>
								After the extremely intense desire for liberation awakens, then when one reads the
								very same quote, instead of thinking about it, or discussing it, one puts it into
								practice.
							</p>
							<p>
								Putting it into practice, there are no more questions, not even questions on spiritual
								topics.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the practice of awareness watching awareness, no questions arise.
							</p>
							<p>
								Take care
							</p>
							<p>
								&nbsp;
							</p>
							<hr />
							<br />
							<p>
								A previous experience:
							</p>
							<p>
								The last 4 or 5 months have been the most rapid change in consciousness that &apos;I&apos;
								have ever experienced. Like a river of insight every day sweeping away all the old
								views including most of the old spiritual views.
							</p>
							<p>
								The desire for liberation became the extremely intense desire for liberation in
								a quantum leap.
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									The awakening of the extremely intense desire for liberation is such a blessing!<br />
									It takes care of everything.
									<br />
									It brings everything one needs (spiritually),
									<br />
									it removes all doubt and it answers all spiritual questions
									<br />
									so that there are no more questions.
									<br />
									It brings great honesty, clarity and insight.<br />
									It brings one to intense practice.
									<br />
									It dissolves all obstacles.<br />
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								It is like surrendering to liberation and the core Direct Path Teachings.
							</p>
							<p>
								One&apos;s whole life is surrendered.
							</p>
							<p>
								I can&apos;t read spiritual teachings with detours. If I try, after just a few sentences
								I can see the detours and I put the book down quickly, just like one would withdraw
								one&apos;s hand quickly from a hot stove. This represents quite a change in consciousness.
								The intellectual approach is now ended, gone forever, dead.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the amazing things about this new river of insight is that first there is
								the insight, then later a quote will be discovered. In other words &quot;I&quot; see something,
								have a profound insight, then later I see that a sage has seen what I have seen.
							</p>
							<p>
								I can see that almost all spiritual paths are detours and distractions, nothing
								more, and I can see why they are distractions and detours, nothing more.
							</p>
							<p>
								Then later I came across the quote by Lao Tzu and see that Lao Tzu has also seen
								this:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									&quot;Not all spiritual paths lead to the Harmonious Oneness.<br />
									Indeed, most are detours and distractions, nothing more.&quot;
								</p>
								<div class="blockquote">
									<p>
										– Lao Tzu, Hua Hu Ching
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>
								Sri Ramana Maharshi stated it like this:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									&quot;The intricate maze of philosophy of different schools is said to clarify matters
									and reveal the Truth. But in fact they create confusion where no confusion need
									exist. Why should confusion be created and then explained away? Ah! Fortunate is
									the man who does not involve himself in this maze! I was indeed fortunate that I
									never took to it. Had I taken to it, I would probably be nowhere - always in confusion.
									My former tendencies directly took me to the inquiry &apos;Who am I?&apos;. It was indeed
									fortunate.&quot;
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								Regarding spiritual teachings, a demand for no detours and delays has arisen. The
								core Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Annamalai Swami, Sri Muruganar, Sri Sadhu
								Om and Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj survived this sweep, but almost every other spiritual
								path did not.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								Even what are called the teachings of those five Direct Path Sages, are filled with
								detours. The detours come from answers to questions which are a reflection of the
								thoughts of spiritually immature questioners. This is another example of having
								the clear insight first, then later discovering that some sage has also seen what
								I have seen.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here is a quote by Sri Muruganar from the Garland of Guru&apos;s (Sri Ramana Maharshi&apos;s)
								Sayings:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									1106. The sage&apos;s pure mind which beholds as a mere witness the whole world is like
									a mirror which reflects the foolish thoughts of those who come before him, <em>and these
										thoughts are then mistaken to be his</em>.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								Those distractions and detours must be removed from the Teachings in order to reveal
								the Direct Path. On the Direct Path Links Directory [Five Sages page] only the core
								Teachings are found, with all the distractions, detours and reflections of the thoughts
								of those questioners who were spiritually immature removed.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are a few core teachings that can help to turn the mind inward and I have
								placed them on the Direct Path Links Directory. Teachings which describe the love-bliss
								of liberation are helpful to increase the desire for liberation. There are teachings
								that help motivate one towards practice. There are teachings that describe the Direct
								Path Practice. There are teachings about how to turn inward and teachings about
								honesty, exposing the false and dropping the false. All of these core teachings
								can be helpful and have been placed on the Direct Path Links Directory.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, what are usually called spiritual teachings, as Lao Tzu pointed out, are
								distractions and detours, nothing more. The intense desire for freedom allows one
								to see that and before the intense desire for freedom awakens, that fact remains
								hidden by the ego.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Direct Path, the Direct Practice, goes by various names such as: Self-inquiry,
								Self-abidance, Self-attention, Awareness watching Awareness focusing the mind on
								&quot;I am&quot;, seeing the seer, knowing the knower, &quot;Who am I?&quot;, finding the source of
								consciousness, turning attention away from the world, body and thought, towards
								attention attending to attention.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								There is a mistaken notion that only those who are ripe are ready to practice the
								Direct Path. This is used by the ego as an excuse to avoid the Direct Path Practice.
							</p>
							<p>
								The ego is unreal and its ripeness or unripeness is also unreal. One need not take
								a lot of time becoming ripe.
							</p>
							<p>
								Anyone who is willing to do the Direct Path Practice is ripe for it. For those who
								are not willing all that is needed is to decide to give it a try and then follow
								through with the decision.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have seen all this clearly and this is another example of having the insight first
								and later discovering that a sage has also seen this. The following is a quote by
								Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj from &quot;I AM THAT&quot;:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									Questioner: &quot;In the beginning we may have to pray and meditate for some time before
									we are ready for self-inquiry.&quot;
								</p>
								<p>
									Nisargadatta: &quot;If you believe so, go on. <em>To me, all delay is a waste of time. You
										can skip all the preparation and go directly for the ultimate search within. Of
										all the Yogas it is the simplest and the shortest</em>.&quot;
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								Almost all humans may have some very weak desire for liberation. However, it is
								very rare that the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened. It is also
								very rare in those humans who are on a spiritual path and rare even in those humans
								who are on what is often considered to be the Direct Path. Therefore almost everyone
								ignores these insights found in the quotes above.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								I am going to write those quotes again here. Please read them very slowly and open
								your mind to the possibility that they reveal something extraordinary:
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									&quot;Not all spiritual paths lead to the Harmonious Oneness. Indeed, most are detours
									and distractions, nothing more.&quot; – Lao Tzu, Hua Hu Ching.
								</p>
								<p>
									&quot;The intricate maze of philosophy of different schools is said to clarify matters
									and reveal the Truth. But in fact they create confusion where no confusion need
									exist. Why should confusion be created and then explained away? Ah! Fortunate is
									the man who does not involve himself in this maze! I was indeed fortunate that I
									never took to it. Had I taken to it, I would probably be nowhere - always in confusion.
									My former tendencies directly took me to the inquiry &apos;Who am I?&apos;. It was indeed
									fortunate.&quot; – Sri Ramana Maharshi
								</p>
								<p>
									Questioner: &quot;In the beginning we may have to pray and meditate for some time before
									we are ready for self-inquiry.&quot;<br />
									Nisargadatta: &quot;If you believe so, go on. To me, all delay is a waste of time. You
									can skip all the preparation and go directly for the ultimate search within. Of
									all the Yogas it is the simplest and the shortest.&quot;
								</p>
								<p>
									1106. &quot;The sage&apos;s pure mind which beholds as a mere witness the whole world is like
									a mirror which reflects the foolish thoughts of those who come before him, and these
									thoughts are then mistaken to be his.&quot;
								</p>
							</div>
							<hr />
							<p>
								The above is brief and someday I may create a separate page to go into much more
								detail as to how this great change took place, what lead up to it, including a more
								detailed description of why the indirect paths are distractions and detours, nothing
								more.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, what allows one to see all that is the awakening of the intense desire
								for freedom. The foundation pages on the Direct Path Links Directory were created
								for the purpose of showing how to awaken the intense desire for liberation. However
								you manage to do it, whatever you can do to make your desire for liberation take
								a quantum leap is well worth doing.
							</p>
							<p>
								The awakening of the intense desire for freedom will insist on only the Direct Path
								because it insists that one take no detours.
							</p>
							<p>
								The awakening of the intense desire for freedom is what sustains intense, constant,
								continuous, practice.
							</p>
							<p>
								The awakening of the intense desire for freedom exposes the ego-lies, falsehood
								and preservation strategies and removes them.
							</p>
							<p>
								The awakening of the intense desire for freedom removes all obstacles.
							</p>
							<p>
								The awakening of the extremely intense desire for liberation is therefore, the key
								of keys.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Direct Path Links Directory is the precious Jewel. Why it is the precious Jewel,
								you can get some sense of from reading the above.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can read instructions on the practice here:
							</p>
							<p class="page-link">
								<a href="awa-instructions.htm">AWA Instructions</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								There will be a few more additions and changes to the Direct Path Links Directory
								in 2004.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								Since this is the Experience page, I thought you might enjoy reading the following.
							</p>
							<div class="blockquote">
								<p>
									A few weeks ago I had a dream. In the dream Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj was teaching
									me how to practice feeling the &apos;I Am&apos;.
								</p>
								<p>
									Nisargardatta only made a brief appearance in the beginning of the dream. The dream
									lasted a long time and consisted only of practicing feeling &apos;I am&apos; and learning
									a different way to practice it. Although there were a few verbal instructions or
									thought instructions, mostly the instruction was non verbal. In other words, a practice
									had been initiated in the dream and the corrections were made automatically in the
									practice in the form of feeling-attention.
								</p>
								<p>
									The practice is difficult to describe. It is like feeling &apos;I am&apos; in the chest. However,
									it is not really a matter of anything physical, that is more just a place for focusing
									the feeling and awareness.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the main points in the instruction is to not expect any experience and not
									to allow any experience to arise. With feeling, one does not allow any experience
									to arise, so that there is nothing, just stillness. It is the rejection of any experience
									with feeling, while feeling the &apos;I am&apos;.
								</p>
								<p>
									The reason is that any experience would be something new. One feels very subtly
									what already is, and not something new. What feels without any motion.
								</p>
								<p>
									One feels feeling that which is still and allows no other feeling or experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									I woke up from the dream. Later I went back to sleep and the new practice began
									again.
								</p>
								<p>
									A few days ago I read the following from the book &quot;I am That&quot;:
								</p>
								<div class="blockquote">
									<p>
										&quot;Those who practice the sadhana (spiritual practice) of focusing their minds on
										&apos;I am&apos; may feel related to others who have followed the same spiritual practice
										and succeeded. They may decide to verbalize their sense of kinship by calling themselves
										Navnaths.&quot;
									</p>
									<p>
										&quot;If you accept a Navnath Sampradaya teacher as your Guru, you join his Sampradeya.
										Usually you receive a token of his grace – a look, a touch, or a word, sometimes
										a vivid dream or a strong remembrance. Sometimes the only sign of grace is a significant
										and rapid change in character and behavior.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>
								Those of you who know me might wonder how the above would be possible since Sri
								Ramana Maharshi has always been my Guru.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is only one Guru. That is the Infinite Self-Awareness within.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the dream humans call the &apos;waking state&apos; or in the dream humans call the &apos;dream
								state&apos; there may be the appearance of a sage who appears to have a body.
							</p>
							<p>
								As Sri Ramana Maharshi and Sri Nisargadatta have pointed out, such appearance of
								a body is only an illusion, a dream just as the world and the universe is only an
								illusion, a dream.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, as Sri Nisargadatta has pointed out, the sage is a dream that can wake
								you up, and it is the teachings of the sage that are important and not the person
								of the guru.
							</p>
							<p>
								When one talks about the type of sage that appears to have or did appear to have
								a body, then you can say that Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Muruganar, Sri Sadhu Om,
								Sri Annamalai Swami and Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj are all my teachers.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, they are all one and that One does not have a body, it is the Self-Awareness
								within.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is no need of going here and there to see some supposed sage or Guru or teacher.
								Their teachings can be found in books. What is important is to practice those teachings.
							</p>
							<p>
								To physically go to see some supposed sage is to follow an indirect path. To go
								deep within one&apos;s consciousness to discover the inner teacher is to follow the direct
								path.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the intense desire for freedom is awakened, all that one needs spiritually will
								be brought to you. If there is any need for Sri Ramana Maharshi, or Sri Muruganar,
								Sri Sadhu Om, Sri Annamalai Swami or Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj to come to you, they
								will come to you.
							</p>
							<p>
								The fact that they are no longer in a body does not matter. They never were in a
								body in Reality. However, there is usually no need for any such appearance.
							</p>
							<p>
								The teachings are there, they can be practiced, the inner teacher can be discovered,
								and the inner teacher is Infinite-Awareness and it has no form, no body, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the dream described above, the appearance of Nisargadatta in the dream was very
								brief. Because the appearance of Nisargadatta in the dream was not what was important.
								The teaching was what was important.
							</p>
							<p>
								Awareness watching awareness is still the primary means to Self-Abidance; however,
								as a way of saying thank you, &apos;I&apos; spend a little time every day practicing the method
								that was taught in the dream as described above.
							</p>
							<p>
								I usually end what I write with the words &apos;take care&apos;. What I mean by &apos;take care&apos;
								is: pay attention, be honest with yourself, slow down, be careful, be aware, challenge
								your beliefs and assumptions, put an end to the ego illusion, practice the Direct
								Path constantly, continuously, intensely, and do all that with love!
							</p>
							<p>
								Take care,
							</p>
							<p>
								with Love
