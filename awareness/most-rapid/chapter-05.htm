								<li>The primary means to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation is to carefully examine two choices every day until the extremely intense desire for liberation awakens.
								</li>
								<li>Choice A is to choose to end the ego by dropping all unnecessary activities, to create the maximum amount of time every day to practice the most direct and rapid means to eternal bliss. </li>
								<li>The most direct and rapid means to eternal bliss, here and now in this lifetime, is the Awareness Watching Awareness Method described in Chapter Seven. </li>
								<li>Choice A is Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss with no sorrow and no suffering.
								</li>
								<li>Choice A is Eternal Life. </li>
								<li>Choice A is to live as your true Self for all eternity. </li>
								<li>Choice A is absolutely perfect joy. </li>
								<li>The above (2 - 7) is a summary of Choice A. </li>
								<li>
									Some people may find it helpful to read more descriptions of Choice A written by the Awakened Ones who have taught in the past and such quotes or a list of books will be provided in future volumes of this book or on The Freedom Religion, inc. web site:

								<li>Choice B is being identified with a body subject to suffering, sorrow, disease, death, violence, fear, anger, etc. </li>
								<li>Choice B is to allow an imposter called the ego to pretend to be yourself and to control you. </li>
								<li>Choice B is to allow an imposter called the ego, that has created all the wars, diseases, death, sorrow, suffering and evil that every human has ever experienced, to continue. </li>
								<li>Choice B is to have a temporary and therefore futile life that leads only to death.
								</li>
								<li>In order to better examine Choice B, you can make a list of all the forms that human sorrow and suffering take. </li>
								<li>You can write on that list thousands of wars, thousands of diseases, thousands of forms of violence and every other form human sorrow and suffering takes that you can think of. Usually humans look only at a small part of the ocean of human sorrow and suffering. The purpose of the list is to look at the entire ocean of human sorrow and suffering all at once. The purpose of the list is to look at the entire negative side of human life all at one time.</li>
								<li>You need only read the suffering list once. </li>
								<li>After that, the summary found in Chapter Five should be enough. <span class="note80">[this chapter]</span> </li>
								<li>Read Chapter Five every day, comparing the summary of Choice A and the summary of Choice B, until the extremely intense desire for liberation awakens in you.
								</li>
								<li>Read Chapter Five every day comparing the summary of Choice A and the summary of Choice B until you have made Choice A. </li>
								<li>How will you know that the extremely intense desire for liberation has been awakened?
								</li>
								<li>When you drop all unnecessary activities every day, and use all of that free time created to actually practice every day the most rapid and direct means to eternal bliss, you will know that the extremely intense desire for liberation has been awakened.
								</li>
								<li>How will you know that you have made Choice A? </li>
								<li>When you drop all unnecessary activities every day, and use all of the free time thus created to actually practice every day the most rapid and direct means to eternal bliss, you will know you have made Choice A. </li>
								<li>The Awakening of the extremely intense desire for liberation, which can also be called &quot;really making Choice A&quot; is (25 - 55): </li>
								<li>It is like a sign stating &quot;NO MORE&quot; that is a million miles high. </li>
								<li>NO MORE to all of the human evils of the past. </li>
								<li>NO MORE to all of the horrors the ego has created. </li>
								<li>It is like a silent shout saying NO MORE so loud, that if it were given a voice it would shatter the eardrums of every human on earth. </li>
								<li>It is a demand for Truth. </li>
								<li>It is the absolute demand for absolute Truth. </li>
								<li>It is the absolute demand for the final end of all human opinions. </li>
								<li>It is the absolute demand for absolute goodness. </li>
								<li>It is the absolute demand for the final end of the imposter who is called the ego.
								</li>
								<li>It is the absolute demand for the Direct Experience of the true Self. </li>
								<li>It is like an infinitely strong grip that grabs hold of Truth with a grip so strong, no power can weaken that grip. </li>
								<li>It is like an infinitely strong grip that grabs hold of the true Self with a grip so strong, nothing is powerful enough to weaken that grip. </li>
								<li>The extremely intense desire for liberation is like an infinitely strong grip that grabs hold of the absolute goodness that has never known falsehood with a grip so strong nothing can weaken that grip. </li>
								<li>It is like an absolutely immovable &quot;NO&quot; saying no to the trillions of human lies spoken in the past and the billions of human lies being thought of each day.
								</li>
								<li>It is an absolute &quot;NO&quot; to the trillions of horrors humans have created in the past and the billions of horrors humans are creating every day. </li>
								<li>It is an absolute demand for the end of all sorrow and suffering. </li>
								<li>It is an absolute demand for perfect infinite-eternal-love-joy. </li>
								<li>It is an absolute demand that the source of all suffering, violence and evil, which is the imposter called ego, come to a final end. </li>
								<li>It is an absolute devotion to the true Self that is the background of awareness.
								</li>
								<li>That absolute devotion takes the form of turning the attention away from the world, the body, thought, etc. and towards awareness watching awareness. </li>
								<li>The extremely intense desire for liberation is a demand for Truth that never compromises.
								</li>
								<li>It is a demand for the end of thought. </li>
								<li>It is a demand for the Direct Experience of the absolute Truth. </li>
								<li>When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, these demands are directed inwards, not towards others. </li>
								<li>When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, one never again bows before any egotistical human. </li>
								<li>When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, all obstacles are swept away.
								</li>
								<li>It is absolute dedication and devotion to absolute Truth. </li>
								<li>It is absolute dedication and devotion to knowing the true Self in Direct Experience.
								</li>
								<li>After the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, every moment of one&apos;s life is dedicated to awakening from the human dream. </li>
								<li>When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, all of the ego&apos;s lies and games are seen for what they are and all of the ego&apos;s lies and games come to an end. </li>
								<li>When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, the nightmare the ego has created is no longer tolerated. </li>
								<li>The ego is the source of all evil. </li>
								<li>The ego is insane. This is true for all humans. </li>
								<li>To produce so many trillions of horrors, the ego has to be evil and insane.
								</li>
								<li>Something in you longs for an end to the imposter&apos;s dream. </li>
								<li>Something in you longs for infinite Love. </li>
								<li>Something in you longs for the end of all suffering and sorrow. </li>
								<li>Something in you longs for eternal-joy-love. </li>
								<li>It is possible to end the ego&apos;s dream and to discover the true Self which is free of all suffering and sorrow and whose nature is infinite-eternal-love-joy. </li>
								<li>It is possible now in this lifetime, while this body is living. </li>
								<li>Co-operate with your Heart. </li>
								<li>Stop listening to your ego. </li>
								<li>If you turn your attention away from thought and towards awareness watching awareness and sustain that look for many hours every day, eventually the ego dream will end and the true Self will be known. </li>
								<li>Then all suffering and sorrow ends and what remains is the eternal perfection of awareness-love-bliss. </li>
								<li>Make Choice A. </li>
								<li>Make your choice absolute and absolutely immovable. </li>
								<li>Make your choice absolutely solid and final. </li>
								<li>Your true Self, the background of awareness that is looking through your eyes now, deserves your attention. </li>
								<li>For your entire life, you have been ignoring your true Self. </li>
								<li>Your true Self, the background of awareness, deserves your love &amp; attention.
								</li>
								<li>Demand sanity. </li>
								<li>The human dream is insane. </li>
								<li>Demand sanity by waking up from the human dream into the reality of your own awareness.
								</li>
								<li>Make Choice A by dropping all unnecessary activities to create more time for spiritual practice. </li>
								<li>Make Choice A by dropping all distractions, detours and entertainment to create more time every day for spiritual practice. </li>
								<li>Make Choice A by making sure your spiritual practice is the most rapid and direct means to eternal bliss. </li>
								<li>The suffering and sorrow that life brings is also a means to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation. </li>
								<li>Reading Chapter Five every day is a much easier and more rapid means to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation. </li>
