								Further Clarification of the Loving-All Method
							</h3>
							<ol start="33" class="book-double">

								<li>If you don&apos;t understand how to practice the above instructions using the word &quot;love&quot;, you can substitute the words &quot;emotionally allow&quot; for the word &quot;love&quot; in the above instructions. </li>
								<li>After practicing every day for one month using the words &quot;emotionally allow&quot;, you can substitute the words &quot;emotionally accept&quot; for the word &quot;love&quot; in the above instructions.
								</li>
								<li>After practicing every day for one month using the words &quot;emotionally accept&quot;, you can go back to the original wording of the instructions, just as they are, using the word &quot;love&quot;, and then continue using the word love from then on. </li>
								<li>The Loving-All Method refers only to your emotions. </li>
								<li>No changes in your external behavior are required. </li>
								<li>For example: if a vase falls and you would normally try and catch it, you will also try and catch the vase while you are practicing the Loving-All Method. </li>
								<li>You do not allow the vase to fall because you are loving the falling. </li>
								<li>If someone were to try to punch you in the face and if you would normally duck, you will also duck while practicing the Loving-All Method. </li>
								<li>The fact that you are loving the fact that someone is trying to punch you does not mean you will not duck. </li>
								<li>You also love the fact that you are ducking to avoid being punched. </li>
								<li>The Loving-All Method is about emotional acceptance. </li>
								<li>The Loving-All Method is not about changing your actions. </li>
								<li>Like any skill, the more you practice, the more skill you gain. </li>
								<li>If someone says something mean to you and if you feel bad emotionally because of what they said, then love your negative emotion and love yourself for having the negative emotion. </li>
								<li>In the beginning, even though you are attempting to love everything and every experience exactly the way it is, you probably will not succeed in loving everything and every experience exactly the way it is. </li>
								<li>Changing the long time habit of emotionally rejecting experiences will require lots of practice. </li>
								<li>Love as much as you can love. </li>
								<li>Keep practicing every day trying to love everything exactly the way it is. </li>
								<li>As the months go by, you will gain more success at loving more and more experiences exactly the way they are. </li>
								<li>It might take some years of practice for you to be able to love everything exactly the way it is. </li>
								<li>Every day, try to love everything and every experience that happens, exactly the way it is. </li>
								<li>Loving everything the way it is includes emotional acceptance. </li>
								<li>Emotional acceptance does not prevent you from trying to change whatever you wish to change. </li>
								<li>What you wish to change, you will still change. </li>
								<li>Whatever action you would normally take to change something, you will still take that same action. </li>
								<li>In the beginning, even though you are trying to love everything you experience, you might only be able to love a small part of what you experience. </li>
								<li>Every day that you practice the Loving-All Method, you will gain more skill at being able to love everything you experience, exactly the way it is. </li>
								<li>You should not try to look inward while engaged in daily activities. </li>
								<li>You should look outward while engaged in daily activities. </li>
								<li>In other words, it is important to pay attention to what you are doing while engaged in daily activities. </li>
								<li>The Loving-All Method is not a &quot;looking inward&quot; method. </li>
								<li>It is important to pay close attention to what you are doing during your daily activities so that your activities flow smoothly. </li>
								<li>If you were to try to look inward during your daily activities, your activities may not flow smoothly. </li>
								<li>For example: if you try to look inward while putting toothpaste on your toothbrush, you might put shampoo or shaving cream on your toothbrush instead of toothpaste, because of having your attention divided between outward and inward. </li>
								<li>Fortunately, the Loving-All Method does not require inward attention. </li>
								<li>The Loving-All Method does not require thought either. </li>
								<li>The Loving-All Method is developing a new feeling habit. </li>
								<li>The Loving-All Method is developing the habit of feeling love towards everything you perceive. </li>
								<li>In the beginning you could try practicing &quot;no emotional resistance&quot; during all of your daily activities. </li>
								<li>In action you can resist all you want to resist. </li>
								<li>If you would normally resist something in action, you will continue to resist something in action while practicing the Loving-All Method. </li>
								<li>Not resisting emotionally has nothing to do with what you do in your actions, activities and behavior. </li>
								<li>You can continue to resist all you wish to resist in your actions, activities and behavior while practicing the Loving-All Method. </li>
								<li>While you may be resisting in action, you do not resist emotionally while practicing the Loving-All Method. </li>
