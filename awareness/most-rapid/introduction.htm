								<li>For thousands of years humans have been stuck in the same pool of inward unsolved problems. </li>
								<li>Thousands of years ago humans had the problems of suffering, sorrow, anger, fear, violence, conning, cheating, lying, death, etc. </li>
								<li>Today humans have the problems of suffering, sorrow, anger, fear, violence, conning, cheating, lying, death, etc. </li>
								<li>All of those problems have a single cause. </li>
								<li>In this book the cause of the lack of progress and the solution that actually works is revealed. </li>
								<li>There is a secret, a missing link, a vicious circle, that is keeping humans stuck in the same pool of unsolved problems. </li>
								<li>That secret, that missing link, that vicious circle is revealed in this book.
								</li>
								<li>How to break free of that ancient human trap is also revealed in this book.
								</li>
								<li>The solutions taught in the past have failed. </li>
							</ol>
							<!-- break between 99 and 100, triple digits -->
							<ol start="10" class="book-double">
								<li>Not even one in a million humans have been freed from all suffering and been established in absolutely perfect infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss by the solutions that have been taught to humanity in the past. </li>
								<li>It is possible to be free of all sorrow and suffering and to experience absolutely perfect infinite eternal joy here and now in this lifetime. </li>
								<li>It is possible for all humans, not just a few humans. </li>
								<li>There is a rapid means to infinite bliss. </li>
								<li>That rapid means is taught in this book. </li>
								<li>The strategies the ego uses to avoid liberation and how to end those strategies are also revealed in this book. </li>
								<li>Whatever spiritual path you are on, this book will be a great help. </li>
								<li>The problem of the ego distorting, distracting and keeping the attention directed outward, is a problem shared by all humans, whatever path they are on. </li>
								<li>The ego&apos;s tricks have seldom been looked at in spiritual literature. </li>
								<li>The ego&apos;s tricks are revealed in this book. </li>
								<li>How to put an end to the ego&apos;s tricks is also taught in this book, making this book a unique and immensely valuable contribution. </li>
								<li>This book will be a great help to all humans, including those who are not on a spiritual path, because the most rapid means to end suffering and sorrow and to live in awareness love bliss, is of benefit to all. </li>

								How to Read this Book
							</h3>
							<!-- continuing 10+ with double digits -->
							<ol start="22" class="book-double">

								<li>When humans are taught to read in school, they are taught to accumulate information and store it in memory in order to be able to pass a test or exam.
								</li>
								<li>If this same approach to reading is used when reading an authentic spiritual teaching, the human will miss what is being conveyed. </li>
								<li>A completely different approach to reading is needed for spiritual reading.
								</li>
								<li>The purpose of an authentic spiritual teaching is to awaken an experience. </li>
								<li>The purpose of an authentic spiritual teaching is to awaken insight. </li>
								<li>To awaken insight, read very slowly. </li>
								<li>Stay with one sentence for a very long time before proceeding to the next sentence.
								</li>
								<li>Do not think about what is being read. </li>
								<li>Thinking is the tool of the ego. </li>
								<li>Thinking will lead away from insight. </li>
								<li>Do not let the ego&apos;s arguments prevent you from seeing what is being taught.
								</li>
								<li>Do not allow the ego to distort what is being taught. </li>
								<li>Do not allow the ego to add to what is being taught, for that too is a method the ego uses to distort. </li>
								<li>This book is a step-by-step instruction manual. </li>
								<li>This book is not for the purpose of intellectual entertainment. </li>
								<li>For human consciousness to be transformed, something new must be introduced.
								</li>
								<li>This book introduces something new into human consciousness. </li>
								<li>Infinite Love-Bliss is available in this lifetime. </li>
								<li>Read each chapter very slowly three times before proceeding to the next chapter.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Read this Introduction very slowly three times before reading Chapter One.
