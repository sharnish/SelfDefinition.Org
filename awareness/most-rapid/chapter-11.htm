								<li>When people practice the Awareness Watching Awareness Method, they often tend to have the perception that awareness is something in their head. </li>
								<li>Your awareness is not in your head. </li>
								<li>Your awareness is infinite. </li>
								<li>The Infinite Space Method helps to remove the perception that awareness is something in your head. </li>
								<li>The Infinite Space Method helps to provide a sense of the limitless nature of infinite space. </li>
								<li>The Infinite Space Method is not an essential method, therefore, the Infinite Space Method should not be practiced more often than once per month. </li>
								<li>You can practice the Infinite Space Method in any position, however, for the first time, try practicing laying down on your bed with the lights turned off. </li>
								<li>If you record the instructions, pause for one minute between each sentence.

								<li>Imagine you are traveling into outer space in one direction in a straight line.
								</li>
								<li>Imagine you have traveled into outer space eight hundred trillion miles. </li>
								<li>Continue in the same direction, along the same line, and travel another eight hundred trillion miles into outer space. </li>
								<li>Now imagine that you have traveled another eight hundred trillion miles into space in the same direction. </li>
								<li>Now imagine that you have traveled another eight hundred trillion miles further in the same direction. </li>
								<li>Now imagine that you are traveling at the rate of speed of one hundred thousand miles per second, and that you have traveled for eight hundred trillion years at that rate of speed in the same direction. </li>
								<li>Now travel for another eight hundred trillion years in the same direction at the rate of one hundred thousand miles per second. </li>
								<li>Now see that no matter how fast you travel and no matter how long you travel, you have not come any closer to infinite space because infinite space never ends.
								</li>
								<li>Now travel another eight hundred trillion miles in the same direction. </li>
								<li>Now imagine that you have traveled another eight hundred trillion miles in the same direction. </li>
								<li>Now travel another eight hundred trillion miles in the same direction. </li>
								<li>Now look forward in the same direction and see that infinite space never ends.

								<li>Now look forward in the same direction and see the meaning of: &quot;space never ends&quot;.
								</li>
								<li>Now travel another eight hundred trillion miles in the same direction. </li>
								<li>Now imagine you have traveled another eight hundred trillion miles in the same direction.
								</li>
								<li>Now look forward in the same direction and see the meaning of: &quot;space goes on forever and ever&quot;. </li>
								<li>See that even if you travel in the same direction for all eternity, you will never come to the end because space never ends. </li>
								<li>Look in the same direction and see infinite space. </li>
								<li>Look in the same direction and see the meaning of: &quot;space goes on forever and there is no end&quot; </li>
								<li>Now realize that space is never ending in all directions. </li>
								<li>That infinite space is your awareness. </li>
								<li>That infinite space is infinite love.</li>
								<li>That infinite space is eternal life. </li>
								<li>See the infinite freedom of infinite space. </li>
								<li>See how infinite space is open to allow everything. </li>
								<li>Whatever wall or boundary you imagine, there is infinite space on the other side of that boundary. </li>
								<li>If you imagine a circle, there is always a larger circle and there is always infinite space on the outside of the circle. </li>
								<li>Now come back to earth. </li>
								<li>Imagine you are sitting outside on a chair. </li>
								<li>There is space in the atoms of your body. </li>
								<li>There is space between the atoms of your body. </li>
								<li>There is space in the molecules of your body.</li>

								<li>The imagined boundaries are also space. </li>
								<li>The earth and everything on the earth is space. </li>

								<li>There is only one space.</li>
								<li>Space is the source of life. </li>
								<li>Space is alive. </li>

								<li>There is only that one eternal-infinite-space-awareness-love-bliss. </li>
								<li>All the boundaries are imagined. </li>
								<li>There are no real boundaries.</li>
								<li>In Reality there is only the infinite freedom of infinite space. </li>
								<li>From time to time in your daily life, focus on the space instead of on the objects.
								</li>
								<li>Space inside the objects, space outside the objects, and space in the imagined boundary.
								</li>
								<li>Never again imagine that space is just nothing. </li>
								<li>Space is that which is truly valuable. </li>
								<li>Space is eternal life-awareness. </li>
								<li>Space is infinite Love. </li>
								<li>One being, one space, one infinite Love. </li>
								<li>Space projecting space into space. </li>
								<li>To focus on space is to focus on infinite freedom.</li>
								<li>To focus the attention on space is to focus on infinite Love. </li>
								<li>Your awareness is space. </li>
								<li>All limits are imagined. </li>
								<li>All limits are a product of delusion. </li>
								<li>All limits are a type of dream. </li>
								<li>It is possible to wake up. </li>
								<li>You can wake up to the Reality of infinite-eternal-space-awareness-love-bliss.
								</li>
								<li>You can wake up to perfect peace. </li>
								<li>You can wake up and discover that you have always been eternal-life-love-awareness-joy.
								</li>
								<li>You can wake up and discover that you always will be eternal-life-love-awareness-joy.</li>
								<li>Because of the long habit of imagining you are a thinker living in a body in a world, it takes much time in practice to wake up. </li>
								<li>You are not a thinker living in a body in a world.</li>
								<li>You are: infinite-eternal-space-awareness-love-joy. </li>
