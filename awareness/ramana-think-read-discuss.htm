										</p>
										<p>
											What is the use? Can they bring in Realization of the Self?
										</p>
										<p>
											Vichara Sagara is full of logic and technical terms. Can these ponderous volumes serve any real purpose?
										</p>
										<p>
											However, some people read them and then seek sages only to see if they can meet their questions. To read them, to discover new doubts and to solve them, is a source of pleasure to them.
										</p>
										<p>
											Knowing it to be sheer waste, the sages do not encourage such people. Encourage them once and there will be no end.
										</p>
										<p>
											Only the inquiry into the Self can be of use. (Self-inquiry)
										</p>
										<p>
											Those familiar with logic, Vritti Prabhakara, Vichara Sagara or Sutra Bhashya, or similar large works, cannot relish small works like Truth Revealed (Forty verses on Reality) dealing only with the Self and that pointedly too, because they have accumulated latent tendencies of mind (vasanas).

											6th April, 1937: Later Sri Bhagavan continued:</p>
										<p>
											&quot;The intricate maze of philosophy of different schools is said to clarify matters and reveal the Truth. But in fact they create confusion where no confusion need exist.
										</p>
										<p>
											To understand anything there must be the Self.
										</p>
										<p>
											The Self is obvious.
										</p>
										<p>
											Why not remain as the Self?
										</p>
										<p>
											What need to explain the non-self?
										</p>
										<p>
											Take the Vedanta for instance: They say there are fifteen kinds of prana. The student is made to commit the names to memory and also their functions. The air goes up and is called prana; goes down and is called apana; operates the indriyas and is called something.
										</p>
										<p>
											Why all this?
										</p>
										<p>
											Why do you classify, give names and enumerate the functions, and so on? Is it not enough to know that one prana does the whole work?
										</p>
										<p>
											The antahkarana thinks, desires, wills reasons, etc., and each function is attributed to one name such as mind, intellect, etc.. Has anyone seen the pranas or the antahkaranas? Have they any real existence?
										</p>
										<p>
											They are mere conceptions. When and where will such conceptions end?
										</p>
										<p>
											Consider the following:
										</p>
										<p>
											A man sleeps. He says on waking that he slept. The question is asked: &apos;Why does he not say in his sleep that he is sleeping?&apos; The answer is given that he is sunk in the Self and cannot speak, like a man who has dived into water to bring out something from the bottom. The diver cannot speak under water; when he has actually recovered the articles he comes out and speaks.
										</p>
										<p>
											Well what is the explanation?
										</p>
										<p>
											Being in water, water will flow into his mouth if he were to open the mouth for speaking. Is it not simple?
										</p>
										<p>
											But the philosopher is not content with this simple fact. He explains, saying that fire is the deity presiding over speech; that it is inimical to water and therefore cannot function!
										</p>
										<p>
											This is called philosophy and the learners are struggling to learn all this! Is it not sheer waste of time? Again Gods are said to preside over the senses of Virat (samashti). So they go on explaining Hiranayagarbha, etc.
										</p>
										<p>
											Why should confusion be created and then explained away?
										</p>
										<p>
											Ah! Fortunate is the man who does not involve himself in this maze!
										</p>
										<p>
											I was indeed fortunate that I never took to it. Had I taken to it, I would probably be nowhere - always in confusion. My former tendencies (purva vasanas) directly took me to the inquiry &apos;Who am I?&apos; It was indeed fortunate.&quot;

										</p>
										<p>
											Sri Bhagavan: &quot;Ravi Marga (Sun Marga) is jnana. Moon marga is Yoga. They think that after purifying the 72,000 nadis in the body, sushumna is entered and the mind passes up to the sahasrara and there is nectar trickling.
										</p>
										<p>
											These are all mental concepts.
										</p>
										<p>
											The man is already overwhelmed by world concepts. Other concepts are now added in the shape of this Yoga.
										</p>
										<p>
											The object of all these is to rid the man of concepts and to make him inhere as the pure Self – i.e. absolute consciousness, bereft of thoughts!
										</p>

											Questioner: &quot;Is the study of science, psychology, physiology, philosophy, etc. helpful for: 1.) this art of yoga-liberation 2.) the intuitive grasp of the unity of the Real?
										</p>
										<p>
											Sri Bhagavan: &quot;Very little. Some knowledge is needed for yoga and it may be found in books. But practical application is the thing needed, and personal example, personal touch and personal instructions are the most helpful aids.
										</p>
										<p>
											As for the other, a person may laboriously convince himself of the truth to be intuited, i.e. its function and nature, but the actual intuition is akin to feeling and requires practice and personal contact.

											Questioner: &quot;Is it any use reading books for those who long for release?&quot;
										</p>
										<p>
											Sri Bhagavan: &quot;All the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for endless reading.
										</p>
										<p>
											In order to quiet the mind one has only to inquire within oneself what one&apos;s Self is; how could this search be done in books?
										</p>
										<p>
											One should know one&apos;s Self with one&apos;s own eye of wisdom.

											The Self is within the five sheaths; but books are outside them. Since the Self has to be inquired into by discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books.

											Questioner: &quot;How is one to think of the Self?&quot;

										<p>
											The very thought of thinking will end in bondage.
										</p>

											Questioner: &quot;Why does not Bhagavan go about and preach the Truth to the people at large?
										</p>
										<p>
											Sri Bhagavan: &quot;How do you know that I am not doing it?
										</p>
										<p>
											Does preaching consist in mounting a platform and haranguing the people around? Preaching is simple communication of Knowledge; it can really be done in silence only. What do you think of a man who listens to a sermon for an hour and goes away without having been impressed by it so as to change his life?
										</p>
										<p>
											Compare him with another who sits in a holy presence and goes away after some time with his outlook on life totally changed. Which is the better, to preach loudly without effect or to sit silently sending out inner force?
										</p>
										<p>
											Again, how does speech arise?
										</p>
										<p>
											There is abstract Knowledge, whence arises the ego, which in turn gives rise to thought, and thought to the spoken word. So the word is the great-grandson of the original Source.
										</p>
										<p>
											If the word can produce effect, judge for yourself, how much more powerful the preaching through Silence! But people do not understand this simple, bare truth, the truth of their every day, ever-present, eternal experience. This Truth is that of the Self. Is there anyone unaware of the Self? But they do not like even to hear of this Truth, whereas they are eager to know what lies beyond, about heaven, hell and reincarnation.
										</p>
										<p>
											Because they love mystery and not the Truth, religions cater to them so as eventually to bring them round to the Self.
										</p>
										<p>
											Whatever the means adopted, you must at last return to the Self; so why not abide in the Self here and now?&quot;
