                                Whether a person is aware of it or not, he is assaulted constantly by misleading and hostile voices within the mind. They speak both through you and to you. Everyone is their target, but because of their extreme cunning, few people ever detect and dismiss them. So the only problem is a lack of information about these foreign voices. The curing facts are as close as your desire for them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is extremely important for you to remember the following truth: these hurtful voices ARE NOT you, and they do not belong to you, but merely speak through your psychic system. Don't take them as being your own voices, any more than you take radio voices as being your own. They simply USE unaware human beings. Your true nature has nothing to do with them. When finally dismissing these sinister speakers you make room for spiritual health and true life.
                            </p>

                                    Insisting that you are too stupid to learn, they add torment by running mental movies through your mind of past follies.</dd>

                                    Mental pain occurs when personal fantasy collides with spiritual fact, but the voices don't want you see this.

                                    A favorite torment is to force pointless repetitions through the mind, such as the words of a popular song.

                                    One speaker says it is safe to reveal your personal secrets to others, then laughs and leaves you to their treachery.

                                    When a man is wrong they command him to insist that he is right, which keeps the man a tragic slave.

                                    One way they assault someone is to talk him into stormy likes and dislikes, which destroy clear thinking.
