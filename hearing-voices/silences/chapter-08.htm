									It was John who always quoted these words of Hamlet to me as his life and the lives
									of others began to mesh with mine. But not just yet: they were all in the future,
									and nothing that followed would have happened if I had not taken the road over the
									Scottish Border in that sunny late May in 1982, to determine whether there was in
									reality "... something in my hands which would have the power to live and act and
									serve the future."
								</p>
								<p>
									The auguries had been consulted and it was indeed deemed auspicious that I should
									begin my apprenticeship with Bruce Macmanaway at his centre at Strathmiglo, and
									there I arrived near midday one Sunday to a kind welcome. I was placed in a flat
									in the village that I shared for a short while with a young student, Nicky, who,
									it turned out, originated from a place not fifteen miles from my own South Welsh
									home. We did not share for very long for she departed, ostensibly to stay with a
									sick friend.</p>
								<p>
									I spent the Sunday evening taking stock of my surroundings and musing upon what
									might happen, though I was not in any way certain exactly what I would be doing,
									for I wasn't to get my "induction" until the following morning. In a sense, though,
									I had company, for since my visit to my Uncle Gwyn it had been put into my mind
									that I was to have transferred to me his two "guides" - "Great Heart and Xiang".
									I cannot remember how I reacted to this intimation, and had not speculated much
									upon what, if anything, it might mean, nor what might follow. I was still very wary
									of <i>any</i> form of intrusion or overt spiritual association, as I am right up
									to this present day, for I have never been without them, good and bad, as I shall
									write in detail later. In addition to the alleged African, Ibn Ubar, who, I assumed
									was still active and party to the developments, I had my new duo, and thus equipped,
									but not thinking specifically about any of "them", I slept well and rose early to
									meet the day.</p>
								<p>
									It was such a beautiful sunny morning, as indeed it was all week, and I walked the
									short distance to "Westbank" - a sturdy former farm house with its buildings converted
									to a variety of other uses, though there were still horses. At the entrance and
									vying with the sun was a rosebush in full bloom, a rose that I have grown myself
									ever since. It is the first of any to show in spring, and although its flowers are
									single and just a couple of inches across, the whole bush presents such a joyous
									picture, truly living up to its name of <i>Canary Bird</i>.</p>
								<p>
									How very much I regret that I can do no more than give you the merest inkling of
									the impact that this week, and particularly this first day, were to have on my life
									and development thereafter. At one level, there is a whole crowd of superlatives
									jostling to be used: at another, and so very potent, are the images that so easily
									return to my mind's eye. In every one of these images there was the sunshine that
									was all pervasive, especially in the part of the treatment area in which I was to
									work closely with Bruce. The sunlight poured in through a large area of glass, which
									itself gave onto a beautiful and imaginative garden, the product of Patricia's mind
									and hands. It illuminated a long room divided by curtains into several consulting
									and treating areas, and shone onto Bruce and two young women, friends, who had arrived
									together, each needing help.</p>
								<p>
									Both were professional violinists and, as with many of their calling, had upper
									back problems. Bruce used to declare that he could muster at least one full orchestra
									from among his clients! Permission for my being there having been sought and willingly
									given, I sat to one side, watched, and listened. A decision having been made as
									to which would go first, Bruce sat and chatted to her, pendulum in hand. I already
									knew what he would be seeking in his mind, but it soon became apparent that he could
									work simultaneously on two levels. A pendulum is used in these circumstances simply
									to indicate a definite "Yes" or "No", giving answers to the mental questions - "Can
									I help this person?" "Are there any problems in the spine?" And so on, following
									a sequence that had been established over years of practice, and through which an
									easy conversation could still proceed.</p>
								<p>
									It was determined that this young woman's problems lay in the muscles controlling
									the shoulder blades, and these in turn were subjected to some subtle and skilful
									manipulation. She was next sat upon a high stool, I stood behind and responded to
									my instruction to "Put your hands there, Roy" - "there" being parallel with her
									spine and between her shoulder blades. So simple, but such a seminal moment, especially
									as the response was almost immediate. "Phoooaaah!" was the ecstatic sound, followed
									by attempts to put the inner sensations produced into context, the nearest analogy
									being, I think, that they were the equivalent of being in a microwave oven. It was
									the response that I needed, for I had had no inkling of what to expect, as through
									my hands I felt nothing, no tingling, no excessive heat, nothing exceptional. And
									there I stayed, applying "hot hands", as my mentors used to phrase it, while the
									second violinist received the equivalent from Bruce. I know that this was commonplace
									to the workers at Westbank, but to me that ecstatic sound had told me all that I
									needed to know, just as I knew that my life would never be quite the same again.</p>
								<p>
									If I needed further demonstration and confirmation, it came with the next client
									of the morning, a Russian Orthodox priest who had arrived with his interpreter.
									A diminutive man, bent and hobbling with a stick, he looked very un-Russian, and
									more like an ancient Chinese intellectual. He was riddled with arthritis in knees,
									hips and shoulders, and kneeling for prayer or his beloved gardening was impossible.
									The conversation, travelling as it did via the woman interpreter, who also had an
									input, was fascinating, but all the while the pendulum was reacting. </p>
								<p>
									Following a series of manipulations, Bruce sat with his hands in place on hip and
									knee, while I was placed to stand so that I could have my hands at the back and
									front of a shoulder. The animated conversation continued, while I felt the crabbed
									little rounded shoulder between my hands. But what was this? My hands were slowly
									coming together, and between them it felt as if the intervening shoulder was melting.
									From time to time a hand came up and stroked the one of mine that was at the front,
									and again, occasionally, the head turned and bright bird-like eyes shone up at me
									from above a beatific smile, which itself emerged from a wispy oriental beard. </p>
								<p>
									I have no real idea how long we stayed thus, but magic moments always end too soon,
									and there he was, being escorted out by Bruce, while his interpreter sat holding
									herself with laughter. What amused her so was that the little priest no longer hobbled
									and had gone off without his stick, totally oblivious to the extent of his now upright
									stature, while it was being slowly explained to him that Bruce never took payment
									from the ministers of any religion.

									What a range of memories and consequences there are to recall and put in some sort
									of order and sequence, as each of the strands of my life unwound and wove again
									one with the other. One of the principal ones, undoubtedly, was that concerned with
									an understanding of many of the factors involved in my own health and that of other
									people, which had been made all the more relevant with my direct opening into the
									field of "healing". </p>
								<p>
									As my body and mind had cleared themselves of all the residues of my unfortunate
									sixteen years of being polluted by the drugs that I had taken, I found that, in
									many ways, I had been going through a process of rebirth and of rediscovery. What
									was coming back to life, and what I was rediscovering, were normal body functions
									and reactions that had been suppressed by all the invasive medications, whose prime
									function had been, after all, to suppress or alter the body's natural functions
									and reactions via their effect upon the central nervous system. Even now, nearly
									forty years after my initial encounter with Librium, I am still trying to re-educate
									my centre of reaction that I would call the solar plexus, which went into a sort
									of rebound after so many years of being suppressed, and has never truly regained
									a stable and natural function.</p>
								<p>
									After having been subjected to a sort of medical "rape" of my mind and body, my
									one overriding approach to anything to do with my health was that which also governed
									my burgeoning activities in the home - Do-It-Yourself. My encounter with Richard
									Mackarness' book, <i>Not All in the Mind</i>, and Sandy's realistic attitude to
									medical intervention, prompted me to start learning in earnest, and from all sources,
									and at every juncture. As I encountered anything to do with health, I read and read
									and asked questions. One learning leap occurred following my hearing of a broadcast
									of the radio programme "You and Yours". </p>
								<p>
									The name "myalgic encephalomyelitis" has thankfully been shortened to M.E. At the
									time, i.e. 1981, and when also known as the "Royal Free disease", it was not commonly
									recognised nor talked about. As the broadcast progressed, I found myself recognising
									in myself so much of what was being described, sufficiently for me to write to an
									address given for further information. With the information package came a very
									detailed and wide-ranging questionnaire, which I duly completed fully and honestly.
									The answers were assessed by a group of doctors who had volunteered their services,
									but, inevitably, it was a procedure that took some time.
								</p>
								<p>
									The reply, when it came, said that there was a distinct probability that I could
									be suffering from M.E., and offered several suggestions about how next to proceed.
									In the time between sending my questionnaire and receiving the reply, I had decided
									that whatever the outcome I had no intention of being saddled with <i>any</i> illness,
									and had moved on, with a determination that I should take as much responsibility
									for my own well-being as I possibly could.</p>
								<p>
									In spite of this decision of mine to disassociate myself from any personal connection
									with an illness, it is worth looking briefly at those of my own reactions that I
									had felt matched the ones that had been used to define M.E. The reason why I do
									so is that they appear severally or alone in a setting that will emerge shortly.
									The effects that I thought that I recognised, or with which I identified, were:
									intermittent difficulty in sleeping; unexplained and unpredictable mood swings,
									particularly to "lows" that went as inexplicably as they had arrived; periodic difficulty
									in achieving coherent thought; physical sensations that were hard to identify or
									specify, as they incorporated aspects of tingling, twitching, numbness and aches,
									which were worse in bed and cumulative through the night, and so on.</p>
								<p>
									One positive and fruitful area of study derived from my increasing use of herbs,
									and was stimulated by a delightful and remarkably informative book <i>Grandmother's
										Secrets</i> by Jean Palaiseul. Over the years, I have acquired other herbals,
									but this is always my reference book of first choice. From it, and allied with the
									information disseminated by the Henry Doubleday Association, I learned of the properties
									of one herb that, in particular, has become both efficacious and influential in
									my life. Comfrey, or knit bone, or any of the many other country names by which
									it is known, has a prolific life in my garden, where it provides the core of my
									composting activities. But it is the remarkable healing properties that it possesses
									that have kept it to the fore ever since I learned of them, and it was these that
									were to have a major influence in my continuing contact with Marie and her dispensary.
								</p>
								<p>
									Sometime in 1982-3, she had written describing the even worse economic situation
									that was enveloping Uganda. In particular, they were desperately short of medicines;
									could I help? I did the first two things that came to my mind, and through which
									I believed that I could achieve <i>something</i>. I contacted the Medical Department
									of my former employers, who most willingly and generously provided a quantity of
									materials and drugs, which I sent. Secondly, I sent a copy of <i>Grandmother's Secrets</i>;
									a book by Lawrence Hills called simply <i>Comfrey</i>, and all my available supply
									of comfrey ointment. </p>
								<p>
									This may appear to some as na&iuml;ve, but many of the ailments being treated in
									the bush were on the surface of the body, where I believed that the direct healing
									promoted by comfrey would be effective. Anyway, I did what I could, and invited
									other agencies to help as well. The ointment duly arrived, on a Friday, and was
									immediately applied to an ulcer that was on the leg of an old man who had walked
									for three days to reach the dispensary. Marie wrote that such an ulcer would normally
									take a fortnight to heal using the standard treatments available to them. However,
									by the following Monday new pink skin started to appear, and within a very few days
									the healing was complete. The old man departed joyfully, calling down blessings
									on Our Lady, while everyone else who was there at the time was most impressed!</p>
								<p>
									After such an auspicious start there had to be a follow up, and that came through
									the assistance of a remarkable man, Lawrence Hills of the Henry Doubleday Organisation.
									He could not have been more helpful, for he obtained seeds of comfrey for me to
									send, and also supplied me with several kilograms of ointment, having himself sent
									an equivalent amount directly. My contribution went to Uganda courtesy of Marie's
									sister, who was about to depart for a holiday there and who carried it with her.
									The ointment was so valued and applied so freely to all manner of skin complaints
									that it disappeared like the proverbial snow off a dyke, so that when Marie returned
									to work following her own break, there was not much left. This remainder was applied
									to a varicose ulcer that had defied all other remedies, and yes, that soon healed
									as well.</p>
								<p>
									The seeds grew into plants, and when they reached maturity and their form could
									be seen, the nuns found that there was comfrey growing in their own garden already!
									But having the plants available led on to other things, for one of the sisters took
									note of a photograph in the book <i>Comfrey</i>. This pictured a woman who used
									to buy at her local cattle market, calves that no one else wanted because they were
									scouring i.e. had diarrhoea. She took them home and fed them milk in which was chopped
									comfrey, and the property which the herb has of being an internal vulnary, helped
									heal the calves' guts, and they went on to thrive. You may be aware that one of
									the prime causes of infant death in tropical regions is dehydration following prolonged
									diarrhoea, and by feeding the infants in a similar way to that of the calves, many
									of them recovered and likewise began to thrive. Marie moved on to a different location
									soon afterwards, and so, eventually, I lost touch with this fascinating development.</p>
								<p>
									However, this was not to be the end of the train of events set in motion by the
									comfrey saga, far from it. I had asked Marie's sister, Wilma, to take some photographs
									during her visit, so that I could appreciate more fully the work of the dispensary,
									and its location. Following her return, Wilma and husband Tony, together with their
									three daughters, came for a week-end visit, bringing with them a large collection
									of slides, which were all-encompassing in the way they in which brought the Ugandan
									bush to life. </p>
								<p>
									I, in turn, was invited to visit them in Dundee, which I elected to do in the coming
									September. I broke my journey with a friend at Livingston, and set off northward
									again early-ish one morning. I planned my journey so that I could call at Westbank,
									principally to renew acquaintances. I had hardly crossed the Forth Bridge than I
									found myself subjected to heavy intrusions and obsessive thoughts as to whether
									I would have enough petrol to cover the motorway part of my journey. Having learned
									that the safest course during such disturbances is to stop and take stock, I left
									the motorway at the first opportunity, bought petrol, and sat awhile to compose
									myself before continuing north, feeling rather more secure and focussed.</p>
								<p>
									When I arrived at Westbank, I found that the reception arrangements had changed
									since my previous visit, and that the people whom I had expected to see were no
									longer there. So I stood composing in my mind what I was going to say to introduce
									myself to the new secretary. She, meanwhile, was attending to a woman who had just
									emerged from treatment. Also waiting patiently nearby was a clergyman. The lady
									having departed, the secretary turned to my neighbour and addressed him "And now,
									Mr Grieve" ... I stepped back and looked at him, and thirty-seven years fell away,
									to the sea off Corfu, and my friend David standing at the foot of the accommodation
									ladder of the aircraft carrier, HMS <i>Ocean</i>, down which he had helped me and
									into the pinnace that was to transport me to the nearby hospital ship.
								</p>
								<p>
									"David, Shepherd, Alan Grieve?" I said, and I treasure to this day his look of mixed
									surprise and consternation, while I hastened to identify myself. I will not even
									begin to try to describe the encounter; words just would not do it justice. Patricia,
									alerted, came out to take in the spectacle, and, when all was reasonably composed
									again, I went in to assist with David's treatment, which seemed fair, as the last
									time we had met he had been tending me.

								<p>
									My visit to Dundee was most enjoyable as Tony and Wilma went out of their way to
									make me welcome. Theirs was a lovely warm and caring household, <i>caring</i> manifested
									in virtually every one of their many activities and work. My visit was broken in
									the middle to respond to an urgent invitation to travel to David's home a short
									distance to the north, where I was to meet his wife Marjorie, and their youngest
									daughter, Margaret, the only one of their four children still at home. </p>
								<p>
									Additionally, I was to renew another friendship, and how delightful that was. During
									our training, and when we had been comparatively close to London, David and I had
									hitched to the north of the city and to Brookmans Park, where there was a Free Polish
									Radio, and where, helping to man it, was David's new brother-in-law, Bruno, who
									had married his elder sister Rae. The epic of Bruno's escape from Poland when it
									was overrun is well worth the hearing, but here he was and Rae also, so welcoming,
									and such warmth.
								</p>
								<p>
									And here it was, the other family that I wrote about earlier, which I hadn't know
									that I had, but which absorbed me as if I had always been a part of it, as did David
									and Marjorie's other children, Allison, Michael and John and their partners, when
									I was to meet them subsequently. But I have to warn you: Bruno's Polish generosity
									with a tumbler and whisky bottle exceeds even that of a generous Scot - and you
									get one nationality <i>added</i> to the other, and you need a strong head!
								</p>
								<p>
									It is interesting to pause and reflect for a moment that if I had not responded
									to the intense intrusions in the way that I had, and left the motorway to compose
									myself, my arrival at Westbank would not have coincided with that of David. This
									pause for reflection really acknowledges the fact that the spiritual intrusions,
									good and bad, were a feature of my every waking moment. That I had coped thus far,
									and continued to cope satisfactorily, says a lot for the strategies that I was developing,
									which in turn owed everything to the fact that I was fully aware of how the voice
									hearing and physical intrusions first began. </p>
								<p>
									I write in analytical detail later describing exactly the variety of forms that
									the intrusions can take, and how they can exert their influence, but for the moment
									please accept that <i>anyone</i> can be imitated, or any situation conjured up within
									one's imaginative mind, and the skill with which this is done is considerable. A
									"voice" resembling that of Inspector Clousseau, or the subtle effects of a sensual
									female presence, can be generated so easily - and all the while I was trying to
									cope within and through this barrage, and wondering whether, indeed, there <i>were</i>
									these three individual "guides", as had been represented. Fortunately the issue
									was to be resolved, and soon.</p>
								<p>
									Still reeling from all the amazement and excitement generated at Westbank by my
									encounter with David, I had, nevertheless, remembered to ask Patricia whether I
									could come with my friends to the absent healing meeting during the coming week.
									She had agreed and so we duly arrived. All the gatherings took place in a spacious
									and light upstairs lounge, and while I haven't consciously tried to copy it in the
									arrangement of my own room, there is, nevertheless, a similarity of ambience and
									outlook, which makes it easy for me to recall this particular day, and sequence
									of events.</p>
								<p>
									We were a small gathering, for, apart from myself, Tony and Wilma, there was just
									Patricia and a woman who normally assisted with her healing work. Patricia began
									a gentle led meditation, and, virtually as she started, and always conscious of
									my intention never to lose control of my own thoughts, I was strongly aware of the
									presence of my supposed quartet of "guides" - four, because my father was sometimes
									represented as being present. </p>
								<p>
									It is difficult to describe one's awareness of "manifestations", but, by whatever
									means, I was conscious of four "individuals" close to me, and almost as soon as
									this fact registered, they moved rapidly to my rear. Suddenly, I became aware of
									a huge body of available resource, support and power. It was as if I had become
									the spear point of a huge phalanx of infinite size; my back was ramrodded, and with
									that came the knowledge that there would be unlimited support and assistance available
									in all my endeavours, but - and this is the most crucial element of the whole event
									- everything would be delivered <i>anonymously</i>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Simultaneously my view out of the window opposite ceased to be that of the garden,
									and instead I was presented with the concept of my far distant goal from which I
									was separated by a varied and difficult terrain. I knew that if I was to arrive
									there, it would only be through my own efforts in walking every step of the way,
									but, provided that this goal was the <i>right</i> one, the available support would
									be immense.
								</p>
								<p>
									Through it all, I had not lost the thread of Patricia's narrative. Symbolically,
									she was taking us to the ultimate centre of healing and the ultimate "healer", as
									we journeyed steadily up the abstract mountain to the divine temple at the top.
									"But", she said, "you may not feel it necessary to go fully to the top, you may
									decide to pause". That, I thought, is for me, and immediately there was fed into
									my mind a view looking down on the small plateau on which my house sits, and I was
									indeed looking <i>down</i> onto my own house. Patricia continued upward to arrive
									at the temple at the top of the mountain in which would be the person, source of
									all healing, but essentially unseen, the "ineffable". </p>
								<p>
									"Hold on" I thought, "this is not my understanding" - all my recent experiences
									following on from recovery from the initial spiritual trauma, had been of a growing
									<i>openness</i> in what I was trying to do, and in respect of relationship with
									the "Holy Family" of my prayer and response. So where did that leave me? Stuck on
									a mountain with nowhere to go? No, for again I was looking down at my house, only
									this time the "lid" was off, and I was looking down into my kitchen and there at
									the table, the arrangement of which was still in the planning stage, sat my "ultimate

									I could not have had plainer answers to my inner questions and to questions that
									I had yet to ask. I would know that in future <i>every</i> voice would be suspect,
									and that, as I further found out, everything that came from a desirable source would
									be entirely by deep "subliminal transfer", and without being represented as coming
									from <i>any</i> nominated "person" - the origin should be obvious and clear.
								</p>
								<p>
									That, unfortunately, did not mean that henceforth there would be absolute certainty
									about the source of anything that came into my head. I wish that this could be so,
									but it is not to be, and constantly one must be on one's guard: constantly.
								</p>
								<p>
									There were many gifts that came via the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and one of these,
									perhaps the most important, is Discernment. It has become customary in certain political
									circles to say everything in triplicate, so I must do the same. Discernment. Discernment.
									Discernment. There is no other option; constant alertness and never drop one's guard.
									Intelligent people become familiar with the ploys of the advertising industry, from
									the full frontal assault, to the subtle, low-key, almost subliminal insinuation.
									The supermarket does not have to advertise its bread; it lets the smell of freshly
									baked loaves diffuse through the air-conditioning. Coffee shops used to let the
									smell of roasting coffee beans drift down the High Street. Who can resist? (Just
									mention a bacon butty, or the smell of frying onions, and I am sure that in some
									mouths the saliva will start to run).</p>
								<p>
									In a similar manner, thoughts, concepts, perceptions of taste or smell even, can
									be subtly drifted into the mind in such a way that one does not realise that they
									have come from anywhere but one's own intellect. It is hard to write of these situations
									without going into an immense amount of detail, and obviously, the perception and
									reaction will differ from person to person. If possible, I shall try to describe
									typical scenarios later in my writing as I enlarge other concepts, although I cannot
									guarantee that I shall succeed. But I must try, for in addition to the direct voice
									hearing experience, there can be created in susceptible individuals obsessions,
									cravings and addictions, self-image fixations and eating disorders.</p>
								<p>
									For my immediate purpose, the additional statements and answers that emerged during
									the course of the meditation could not have been more plain, either. There would
									be no ethereal, unreachable "temple of healing" in my predictable future other than
									here in my own home. Neither need I look further than these four walls for my role
									model; he would be here, both inside me as I attempt to emulate him and at my side
									or in my hands when I ask for help for others. I am sorry that I cannot comment
									further, but my spiritual life and thoughts are very private to me, as are the dedications
									of my self and my domestic resources to the needs and care of others here or where
									they are reachable.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I had returned from my first visit to Westbank, I found myself essentially
									on the edge of a void. Full of thoughts of my new found talents, having no point
									of reference, no one with like experiences to consult or with whom to explore ideas,
									I felt as a painter must when faced with a blank canvas. But whereas the painter
									has been there before, has had tuition and had tutorial experience, and has a whole
									tradition of painting deriving from early times from which to draw inspiration,
									I was looking at my own canvas, but finding that there was no living tradition of
									healing there to guide me, nor practitioners to consult. </p>
								<p>
									It might have been said that I had my role model, and that his healing exploits
									have been fully written about in the New Testament. Quite so, but at times this
									association with Biblical healings turned out to be a major disadvantage in addressing
									the expectations that many individuals have.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some people preface the word "healing" with "spiritual" or "faith", and from those
									two words many things flow. Firstly, the word "spiritual" has, for some, a connotation
									of "spiritualism" that they find unacceptable; for others it betokens an interaction
									with spiritual beings, which they are not prepared to experience. Yet again, there
									can be the unspoken expectation of a "Jesus"-type miracle, a concept that an individual
									could find overwhelming.
								</p>
								<p>
									Secondly, "faith" also releases a whole gamut of reactions; is it the faith of the
									practitioner or the faith of the patient that is implied? If it is the faith of
									the patient, does that mean that he or she has to take on board any <i>religious</i>
									beliefs or practices, and if there is no cure or improvement, does that mean that
									the person did not have enough faith, or that past "sin" was an impediment?</p>
								<p>
									I found all these reactions, either expressed openly or implied, as I started to
									offer to individuals what I thought would be of benefit to them. Gradually, as these
									resposes started to become apparent, and as my own predilections came to the fore,
									my approach, technique and strategy started to develop.</p>
								<p>
									It may be asked why I did not follow exactly the methods and techniques that I had
									witnessed and assisted with during my time at Westbank. That would be a fair point.
									There are two reasons why I did not do so: the first is that, as you may recall,
									I no longer used a pendulum: the second is that I never felt myself to be sufficiently
									competent to perform any physical manipulations upon a person. In the event, and
									as will emerge, I adopted, and gradually developed, a practice based upon and more
									suited to the analytical engineering method that governs my approach to most situations.
								</p>
								<p>
									You may remember that in my work with measuring devices in the nuclear plants, if
									any piece of equipment failed it was not sufficient simply to repair it, but the
									<i>reason</i> for its failure had to be known and eliminated before a repair could
									be considered complete. Similarly, with any illness there must be a cause or causes,
									which if found could be addressed and hopefully eliminated, although I did not reach
									a sufficient degree of competence to follow this investigative path for some time.
									Initially, and continuing while my understanding and experience increased, I simply
									applied my hands where and for how long seemed appropriate.

								<p class="part-number">Part 4</p>
								<p>
									The simple and the practical - that sums up both my original and continuing approaches.
									As I have written several times before, I am embarrassed by the showy, the exaggerated,
									and I did not want to inflict anything of that nature upon the people whom I was
									trying to help. Thus, there were no elaborate manual "passes", no "aura stroking",
									no adjuncts such as crystals or essences, no overt "religious" or mystical ceremony.
									Just the simplicity of my hands and intellect - and who? </p>
								<p>Without going into detail,
									I had committed myself completely to my own <i>intent</i> when trying to help someone,
									and had committed myself unequivocally to the spiritual association in which I totally
									believed. Having made that commitment privately there was no need to produce it
									on show; I simply carried it with me into every healing encounter, in the absolute
									and certain belief that, as and when needed, help would be forthcoming from an ethereal
									source. So far, I have never been disappointed.</p>
								<p>
									In mentioning or discussing such interventions I am always conscious of the danger
									of presenting myself as one of the "chosen", or of appearing to be a sanctimonious
									prig: neither, I hope, is the case. In mentioning or describing any overt spiritual
									or ethereal participation, I do so simply to affirm that such <i>does</i> happen.
									I also do so to balance what may appear to be the solely <i>terrestrial</i> and
									pragmatic approach that was developing as my response to the individual ailments
									that were being presented to me. The fact that, as I continue writing, I shall give
									much more space to this latter approach, reflects the nature of the process of exploration
									with which I found myself involved.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition, I find it necessary to readdress the issue of continuing adverse spiritual
									intervention and intrusion. Like you, I would have supposed that with such powerful
									and benevolent spiritual allies, all aggressive opposition would be swept away.
									Not so. In real life, no matter how powerful the civil law enforcement and protection
									agencies, there are thieves, muggers, delinquents of all kinds, and violent and
									"road-raging" individuals.
								</p>
								<p>
									Equally, within a life of developing spiritual openness, and throughout one's attempts
									to put the results of one's spiritual awareness into practice, increasingly one
									meets the equivalent from the adverse spiritual world. Direct mental aggression,
									traps and trip-wires are all there for the unwary, as are the "con-artist" and deviant.
								</p>
								<p>
									As events moved on, I began to recognise more and more of the ways in which one
									can be taken over, demoralised, undermined and tricked, and sometimes dominated.
									Different "ploys" began to emerge, as did an awareness of the times, circumstances
									or occasions when certain attacks were made and were effective. Increasingly, I
									began to observe and recognise these for what they were, and to record the various
									ones as they happened. Some will emerge as I write, but in the main, I will describe
									and analyse the modes of attack all together in a later section.
								</p>
								<p>
									Somewhat fancifully, and without being specific, I imagined the great and the good
									being carried on their palliases to my home to be made whole. Such imaginings, which
									I do not think that I took very seriously, were soon dispersed as I found my "great
									and good" amongst the farmer, the coal man and the housewife. Again, a catalogue
									of people and their ailments would be inappropriate and frankly boring. There are,
									however, a few encounters within which pointers can be seen, indicating the way
									in which my thought and practice were developing, and that are worth describing.
									In some, I perceived strong evidence of "ethereal" involvement; and there were others
									within which I was permitted to see the inner resource and heroism of individuals,
									as they confronted a potentially fatal illness.</p>
								<p>
									I happily adopted the word "ethereal" from Patricia Macmanaway. I had discussed
									with her the situation that was created by the fact that I did not dowse nor manipulate
									people's bodies in the ways that were practiced at Westbank. She told me of others
									who did neither, yet were able to achieve results, as their clients could be manipulated
									"ethereally". I saw no problem with this approach since my body had been physically
									"restructured" by such means during the earlier events of my spiritual encounters,
									and in this manner I proceeded, initially simply placing my hands where seemed appropriate.
									I did not dispute or question the fact that I believed what I had had demonstrated
									to me, namely that there was immense resource available, and that I was participating
									in a "combined operation". I did not find it necessary to keep voicing a disclaimer
									to the effect that "I am but a channel", but proceeded as simply as I could, and
									explained to people as well as I could what it was I was trying to do.</p>
								<p>
									On some occasions, I felt that my role was to act as an "anaesthetist" while others
									went about the <i>real</i> work. For example, I was once asked to help a woman who
									had mental trauma following a difficult breech birth and episiotomy. Beginning with
									my hands covering her upper back and shoulder, which itself is very tranquillising,
									I ended with a hand each on her lower back and abdomen. It was then that I became
									"<i>aware</i>" (again the difficulty of describing awareness in these circumstances)
									of two "individuals" close by, and of her "ethereal" legs being placed in the birth
									posture, while that which was required was done.
								</p>
								<p>
									On many other occasions, I recognised my personal inadequacy in the face of very
									serious illness, and appealed directly to "higher authority". I did so for Esther.
									She had an inoperable brain tumour at the base of her skull, and had had much exploratory
									surgical intervention. Now she was about to have radiation therapy along her spine.
									One evening as she lay reclining, I placed my hands adjacent to her head and asked
									fervently for help for her. Soon we were enveloped within a cocoon of love so strong
									that I felt that I could reach out and touch it. All Esther's treatments and therapies
									produced favourable results and she lived actively for another year, when unfortunately
									she succumbed to meningitis. She was one of many individuals from whom I learned
									of the determination and inner resources that can reside within a person when faced
									with the fatal potential of their condition.
								</p>
								<p>
									But this was only a part of the learning process through which I was going at the
									time, because within Esther's flat I came to realise the insidiousness of geopathic
									stress, for where she slept was awful. This was also the situation that I found
									when I visited John's house, for where he had slept, I could not. But I jump ahead
									of myself, for I have not yet arrived at the time when I became a supporter of the
									so-called "gentle approach" to cancer, and I have so much to observe and to learn
									about many things.
								</p>
								<p>
									Returning to events in their sequential order, I must describe the outcome of <i>another</i>
									broadcast from the B.B.C. Radio 4, "You and Yours" programme. This particular one
									was about SAD - the so-called "seasonal affect disorder" - and described experiments
									that were in train at the Maudsley Hospital, which were trying to confirm the hoped-for
									beneficial effect upon sufferers of exposure to high intensity light during the
									winter months. As with the previous M.E. broadcast that I had heard, I thought that
									I recognised in myself a broad swathe of the symptoms and reactions that were described.
								</p>
								<p>
									I can almost hear you thinking, "We've got a right one here, a paranoid hypochondriac,
									no less". My attendance at my local surgery should give the lie to that, for apart
									from annual flu injections and a visit to become acquainted with a G.P. on whose
									list I chose to go, in well over five years I have only consulted about a minor
									fungal infection and nothing more. No, there are specific reasons for my apparent
									over-sensitivity that began to emerge, and which have prompted me to engage in a
									study that has been continuous since about 1981.</p>
								<p>
									Certain aspects of my home and its location have emerged as my narrative has developed,
									but nothing has been written directly about its tranquillity and freedom from pollution.
									There is no source of industrial pollution within twenty-five miles; traffic along
									my adjacent (very) minor roads is so minimal that each passing vehicle is almost
									an event to be remarked. Apart from occasional gunfire from a nearby M.O.D. gun-range,
									noise, other than from tractors working nearby fields and the bleating of sheep,
									is non-existent. The only electrical pollution comes from the two low voltage wires
									bringing the supply to the house, while the effects of microwave transmissions are
									diminished by mountains to the south and east, and the sea two miles to the west.
								</p>
								<p>
									Added to all of this, I have my own private water supply, originally from streams
									running off the nearby fell-side and, since 1996, from a 50 metre bore hole in one
									of my fields, so the only additions to the water are solely what nature puts in
									- no chlorine, no fluoride. Thus, compared with most urban living, industrial working
									individuals, I can and do live with several layers of protective "shell" removed,
									and that is why my urban visits are curtailed, and my last visit to London was in
									about 1989. It also means that I, as with many individuals in similar locations,
									have developed an awareness of extremely subtle variations in my ambient environment
									and of my responses to them. Thus, I have a very suitable "laboratory" in which
									to observe myself and what are, it transpired, very sensitive reactions to subtle,
									and mainly electrical, phenomena. I am not alone in this sensitivity, for about
									forty percent of individuals are similarly sensitive, but their reactions are often
									masked by the gross effects of the polluted environment in which many have to live.
								</p>
								<p>
									None of these many facets were visible to me when, following the programme broadcast,
									I wrote asking whether it was possible to obtain for domestic use the type of light
									that the experimenters described. The response when it came was a surprise, for
									it materialised as a phone call from a doctor actually at the Maudsley Hospital.
									He was one of the research team and quizzed me for some considerable time. He judged
									that I was of the type that was being studied, and invited me to the hospital for
									a fuller discussion and examination.
								</p>
								<p>
									We spent the greater part of a morning together, taking my history and analysing
									my reactions in particular circumstances. Although I could have stayed nearby with
									my brother while participating in tests through a winter, I new that my reactions
									would be distorted by the urban environment, and even though the researcher concluded
									from his observations that indeed I could be considered as suffering from SAD, we
									opted, in the circumstances, for a different strategy. We agreed that I would study
									my reactions through the coming winter, keep a diary and ultimately report.</p>
								<p>
									Thus began my close observation, and the study expanded as I started to identify
									reactions, but also, and increasingly, began to identify <i>causes</i>. However,
									before I launch into a description of what and how I studied, let me make what I
									consider to be a significant observation. I had responded thoroughly and honestly
									to all the questions from the M.E. team, who had concluded that in all probability
									I had M.E., and now a researcher from the Maudsley Hospital, to whom, again, I had
									responded completely and truthfully, had concluded that I was one of those who succumbed
									to SAD. In both cases, what had prompted me to contact the radio programme had been
									a set of virtually identical symptoms or reactions.</p>
								<p>
									Slowly, as I began to observe and record, but definitely, I became aware, as I never
									had before, of the natural world, the world in which we evolved and continue to
									have our being, and became aware, also, of some of our reactions to its variables.
									As time went by, I realised that SAD-type reactions could occur at any time of the
									year, but, as they might not coincide with the dark, drear days of winter, and because
									they were transient, they passed almost unnoticed, having possibly affected me for
									a day or two.
								</p>
								<p>
									My acquisition of the book, <i>The Ion Effect</i> by Soyka and Edmunds, provided
									me with an understanding of the electrical nature of our surrounding world and atmosphere,
									and gave me insights into some of the causes of my reactions. And so began an observation
									of weather <i>systems</i> - not "hot or cold", "wet or dry", "windy or still" -
									but an attempt by me, through seeing the entire system, to be able to judge from
									<i>where</i> the current ambient air had come, and thus to form some conclusion
									about its electrical qualities.
								</p>
								<p>
									One by one, other variables came to light, and were included amongst the subjects
									for study. One such became apparent from the unlikely event of having a new pair
									of glasses. I had chosen the then comparatively new variable-focus lenses. Because
									they need to be positioned precisely, and because I was very active out of doors,
									I had decided upon close fitting frames with curled, springy loops over the ears.
									It took a little while to get used to the accurate positioning of the head that
									viewing required, (Little Noddy is the appropriate name as the head is moved slightly
									up or down to achieve focus), but when I had done so, I enjoyed the freedom that
									the lenses gave me.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, from time to time I found myself getting irritated with my new acquisition,
									for the frames became tight on my head, and they needed frequent adjustment to restore
									them to the proper viewing position. The irritation lasted for three or four days
									at a time, and then things returned to normal. It took approximately six months
									for the penny to drop. The periods of irritation coincided with the new and full
									moons.

								<p>
									"... but this is wondrous strange!", quoth Horatio. Not so, when one considers that
									our body has within itself such a high percentage of fluid. I can still hear the
									voice of my then GP as she shot me down - "<i>With respect</i>!!! Roy..." - never
									having allowed herself a moment for reflection.
								</p>
								<p>
									Consider this: if you take a bowl of water to the equator and pull the plug, the
									water goes straight down, without a swirl: take it one bowl-width either way, north
									or south, pull the plug and the water swirls, anti-clockwise in the north and the
									reverse in the south. Fluids are <i>remarkably sensitive</i> to the forces acting
									upon them, and "the moon, mistress of the floods" exerts a significant pull. So,
									I had another factor to observe and insert in my human reaction equation, and a
									greater awareness of the moon and its movements developed.
								</p>
								<p>
									And not only the moon, for, over time, the involvement of the whole planetary menagerie
									emerged. <i>But</i> - before you have time even to form the thought - there is nothing
									of <i>astrology</i> in this. What emerged, and what I will write about fully in
									an appropriate place later, is that the moon, alone or in conjunction with other
									planets, or these planets together in significant groups, can have an ac-tual <i>physical</i>
									effect upon people, their well-being and interactions. The effects are engineered
									through subtle gravitational changes and variations in the natural electrical/magnetic
									environment, which, in turn, have an impact upon the solar wind and its components.
								</p>
								<p>
									If I had any doubts about the electrical functioning of our bodies, they were dispelled
									when I got to know someone who practices the electrical form of acupuncture. In
									traditional Chinese acupuncture, imbalances within the body and between the various
									meridians are detected by feeling for variations in subtle pulses at the wrists.
									The electrical version uses a measuring instrument to detect similar imbalances
									- measurements being made at the meridian ends on feet or hands.
								</p>
								<p>
									Naturally, I wanted to know more, and went to experience this particular therapy.
									Correction of imbalances is effected either by using a traditional needle as in
									normal acupuncture, or by feeding into an appropriate acupuncture point a small
									electric current through a moist conducting pad. The input to the pad can be varied,
									and is usually under the control of the clients in order that they can decide upon
									their own discomfort level. My friend was frequently surprised that I reached my
									discomfort threshold at such a low level of input, a fact that reinforced my developing
									knowledge of the vastly different electrical sensitivities of various individuals.
								</p>
								<p>
									Any further encouragement that I needed to explore these phenomena came from the
									growing realisation that part of my own personal contribution to the healing process
									came from what I began to see as a subtle body electricity. This realisation, in
									its turn, proved to be a deciding factor in the way in which my approach to healing
									developed then and subsequently.
								</p>
								<p>
									Marrying the concept of body electricity with the understanding of the electrical
									nature of the acupuncture points and meridians, led me to experiment by directing
									my healing "energy" through appropriate points, simply by touching them with my
									fingertips for a suitable length of time. Over a period of time, I acquired a number
									of texts and atlases of acupuncture, covering both the traditional Chinese methods
									and the newer electrical methods, in which Dr Julian Kenyon has been a prolific
									author, sources of reference that are never far from my side. My choice of this
									approach was further strengthened by the realisation that I could practice on myself,
									which I do either for my own benefit or for experiment.
								</p>
								<p>
									A series of programmes on television initiated my next quantum leap. The so-called
									"Bristol Approach to Cancer" was featured in six weekly stages in which the nature
									of the approach was described, and in which the progress of a number of individuals
									with cancer was observed and monitored. So strongly did I admire the pluck and resource
									of these people that I determined to add my own support if the opportunity arose.
									I did not have long to wait, for a friend told me that one of the original "Bristol"
									founders had started another base within reach of my home.
								</p>
								<p>
									I made contact and after several months found myself spending one day a month trying
									to help. I drove for about an hour and a half to a school that, on this day each
									month, was transformed - transformed into what? The concentration of supporters
									and helpers providing organisation, superb food and therapies galore, was intense.
									If a therapy was available and was thought to be of value, it was added to the galaxy
									- reflexology, music and movement, art, nutrition, healing, counselling - <i>anything</i>
									that it was felt would enhance the prospects and quality of life of the individuals
									who came seeking help.</p>
								<p>
									But there was another sort of "concentration" which was quite indefinable, and which
									was voiced by a lady who came to my "pitch". She was near to tears. "I can't take
									it" she said, "I can't take it. For years I have cared totally for my parents to
									the exclusion of myself, and now, coming here, I find so many people wanting to
									do the same for me ... so much <i>love</i> ...". When our period together was ending,
									she looked beyond me and said, "Who is that man? How I wish I could find just what
									it is that he has got". I looked behind me to see John standing and patiently waiting,
									for we had overrun our scheduled time. "That's John", I said. "He has leukaemia".
									But he didn't just "stand", for he walked and stood inside a smile.</p>
								<p>
									John and Vanessa. It is impossible even now, several years after John's death, to
									separate them in my thoughts; and speaking on the phone to Vanessa, as I do from
									time to time, it is still as easy to talk <i>about</i> him as it was <i>to</i> him
									when he was alive. Together they exemplified the whole concept of the "Bristol"
									approach that encourages partners to work as one against the cancerous intrusion.
									("<i>We</i> have cancer", Arnold used to say when speaking of his wife Muriel).
								</p>
								<p>
									But more than that, John and Vanessa studied and followed-up every conceivable remedy
									or therapy that might help to improve John's condition. They were very rigorous
									followers of the "macrobiotic" diet, a practice that benefited me considerably whenever
									they came to stay, for they brought all the wide ranging and delicious ingredients
									with them, and while I gave John his healing "fix" in a quiet part of the house,
									Vanessa was busy preparing the most appetising and visually delightful food. "Love
									on a plate" I used to think, as I gorged on exquisitely prepared and cooked vegetables,
									with perhaps a "Swiss-roll" of grains rolled in seaweed. ("Sea <i>vegetables</i>!"
									I was constantly reminded).</p>
								<p>
									It was in their home that I began to take seriously the actuality of geopathic stress.
									On my first visit, I was put in a double bed in a room that John had used in a previous
									marriage, but had almost no sleep because I was constantly beset by aches, twitches,
									tinglings and numbnesses the whole night through. On a second visit, I asked if
									I could turn the bed at right angles in case it was the orientation that was causing
									these effects, but experienced little improvement. On my <i>next</i> visit, I was
									put in a different room and slept very well.
								</p>
								<p>
									Several of us had gone to stay with Vanessa and John to take part in a series of
									workshops that were particularly aimed at exploring the so-called "muscle testing"
									method of identifying a person's allergies, opening yet another avenue, to which
									I will return later.
								</p>
								<p>
									Participating with us, and returning later to join in the evening meal, was a man
									who took his dowsing talents wherever he went. A great enthusiast, it was natural
									that he should make a full survey of the house, where he detected two earth currents.
									One current occupied a narrow strip about 30cm wide that went the length of the
									house, while another, equally narrow, crossed it diagonally towards one end. The
									first ran down what had been John's side of the bed, the side where I had been unable
									to sleep; the other crossed the first, exactly under the location of his relaxation
									chair.
								</p>
								<p>
									The whole visit was highly educational, and not only with respect to the information
									that it revealed to me, but also because it helped me to see aspects of human nature
									and behaviour that I had never experienced before. One interesting consequence came
									later from the man who did the dowsing. He carried out a survey of the gypsies who
									regularly attended the Appleby horse fair, quizzing them about their lifestyle,
									diet, domicile, smoking and other habits.
								</p>
								<p>
									He found that the genuine <i>travelling</i> gypsies had an extremely low incidence
									of cancers and heart conditions, irrespective of diet and other factors, compared
									with those who had stopped travelling and had settled into permanent housing. His
									deduction was that the traditional sites used by the travellers had been assessed
									for their safety through the fundamental, unsuppressed instincts of these "natural"
									people, and, furthermore, by never spending long at any one place, their exposure
									to anything adverse was greatly diminished.
								</p>
								<p>
									I do not think that I had returned home for more than a day when I had a phone call
									from the friend who practiced electrical acupuncture. She had been to a very interesting
									talk and demonstration on the subject of muscle testing for allergies! Floored by
									the proverbial feather, I picked myself up and asked for more.
								</p>
								<p>
									It transpired that the practitioner was well known to me. Graham had first come
									into my orbit as a young graduate electrical engineer whom I was instrumental in
									engaging during my stint in charge of Training at Sellafield. Now, about sixteen
									later, our paths were converging again. Much has resulted from this convergence,
									some of which will emerge as I continue, but in the immediate time it was such a
									relief to have another electrical engineering mind with which to share ideas, experience
									and information, and one that also thinks highly of Nikola Tesla!
								</p>
								<p>
									Graham was himself completely committed to exploring the concepts of geopathic stress
									and the consequences of the electrical phenomena that I had been discovering and
									studying. He was impelled by a very strong motive, for his wife has multiple sclerosis,
									and he was convinced that her sensitivity to electrical interference was a major
									contributory factor. In a similar manner to John and Vanessa, and the way in which
									they had set about studying leukaemia in all its aspects, Graham and his wife were
									equally zealous in doing the same with regard to M.S. Some of their investigations
									and what they have found will emerge fully later.</p>
								<p>
									If I needed any <i>further</i> convincing about the existence and effect of geopathic
									stress, I received ample confirmation in two separate locations. Esther had lived
									with her partner in a particular flat, which I visited. Standing at the bed head,
									I experienced a feeling of acute nausea, which subsided as I moved down the length
									of the bed towards the foot. One of the pair used to experience heavy, disturbing,
									teeth-grinding nightmares, and morning depression, while the other regularly awoke
									feeling the equivalent of a heavy weight on the chest, following very disturbed
									sleep. Houseplants, of which they had many, would deteriorate rapidly if placed
									on the bedside tables, but regained full health when moved to other locations. Esther
									had returned to her parents' home, but her partner, alerted to the unhealthy siting
									of the bed, moved it within the room and experienced normal sleep.
								</p>
								<p>
									The second location was inside the home of my cousin in Carlisle. Calling there
									as I returned from Westbank, I had been concerned to see how she was deteriorating
									from a condition that was developing in her spine, which, it turned out, was the
									consequence of treatment that she was receiving for severe muscular rheumatism.
									She was on a "diet" of steroids, and her spine was disintegrating slowly. </p>
								<p>
									Ivy had been a nurse, a late entrant to the profession, having nursed a crippled
									mother until the latter's death. She had been a gold medal winner at Edinburgh Royal
									Infirmary, and her compassion and caring shaped her every activity. However, her
									training had also given her a misplaced acceptance of the authority, nay, <i>majesty</i>,
									of Consultants, and even though she knew the dangers of continued ingestion of steroids,
									nevertheless would not override the advice of someone so revered. And so she continued
									taking the tablets, until, bent nearly double and unable to breathe, she died in
									her sleep.</p>
								<p>
									Ivy had moved into this particular house a few years earlier, joining forces with
									a nursing friend who also had never married. Visiting them one day, and sitting
									in a particular seat, I was concerned to find an intolerable ache developing in
									my back. I rearranged cushions, but the ache persisted and got worse.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then suddenly it dawned - geopathic stress. I excused myself, ostensibly to the
									loo, and on returning took a different seat. Instant relief. I came home and pondered,
									and then raised the question with the two. Ivy's condition had only developed since
									moving to the house - she normally sat in this horrible area, and slept immediately
									above it. Her friend, sleeping in a second bedroom that was in an area of lesser
									stress, had, nevertheless, developed the most atrocious teeth grinding, of which
									she was unaware.
								</p>
								<p>
									Importantly, however, the friend's dog would not remain within that particular downstairs
									room, solely entering it if called, but immediately retreating. I tried to give
									Ivy a device called a "Raditech", that I shall describe in detail later, which,
									using the natural resonance of its inbuilt electrical coils, can significantly diminish
									the effects of the earth currents. Unable to be convinced, and worried about incurring
									any expense, which I assured her was non-existent, she carried on as prescribed,
									and sadly died.

									Teeth grinding, nightmares, night-time depression, unexplained aches, cancers, psychological
									problems, incessant crying of infants, are all listed in two books that I own, as
									consequences of remaining in stressed areas. I have mentioned earlier the book by
									Gustav von Pohl; the other is called <i>Are You Sleeping in a Safe Place?</i> Written
									by Rolf Gordon, it provides clear information about the sources of geopathic stress,
									and its effects upon people. There are clear instructions on how to dowse for earth
									currents, and also descriptions of the sensitivity to them of plants and animals.
									The responses of the dog belonging to my cousin's friend, and of Esther's plants,
									should help to convince sceptics that the <i>human</i> reactions are neither subjective
									nor psychosomatic. </p>
								<p>
									Rolf had a son who died of a cancer that he is convinced owed much in its origin
									to geopathic stress. He has since become a zealot in the promotion of knowledge
									about the phenomenon, and about devices such as the "Raditech", which he sells,
									the beneficial effects of which have often been demonstrated. Anyone who is interested
									in keeping up to date with current knowledge and experience will find a considerable
									amount of information on the Internet, as they will about most of the other topics
									that I introduce.</p>
								<p>
									My own reasons for including so much about a diverse range of phenomena are two
									fold. First, there is the appreciation of the way in which my knowledge and awareness
									were expanding, and, in doing so, were affecting the direction in which my life
									was moving. Second, many of the phenomena affect sensitive and vulnerable individuals
									in ways that make them even more susceptible to adverse spiritual intrusion. The
									circumstances in which this can happen, and the methods used, will be revealed later
									when I write the appropriate section.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many people refer to the "Swinging Sixties" as having been so very influential upon
									the subsequent development of their lives. If asked, I would cite the "Enlightening
									Eighties" as the years during which many aspects of my life came together as a coherent
									whole. I do not know if you sense it, but I am having something of a struggle in
									riding the verbal flow. I feel somewhat as if I am rafting down a fast flowing,
									boisterous river that is being joined at unpredictable intervals by equally turbulent
									confluences, as all the new sources of information and experience pour their contribution
									into the main flow, and to which I have to adjust in order to continue to stay in
									control without losing a sense of direction.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the counsels given to mariners in charge of vessels at sea when things appear
									to be getting out of control is "Ease her, stop her, go astern". Well, I certainly
									cannot slow the river, nor go astern, so let us steer into an eddy and pause to
									take stock.
								</p>
								<p>
									Reflect, I would not have been in this particular flow, nor in this actual channel,
									except for the events of 1979-80, and the spiritual traumas and awakening that occurred
									then. Coincidentally with that time, I had been discovering unexplored talents in
									artistic craftwork, and in particular in the field of leather carving, which I hoped
									and planned to take it to an advanced level. The lady who introduced me to this
									craft, someone who herself has much skill and artistry in many directions, subsequently
									has become a very good friend. It was she who effected my introduction to the retired
									art professor, carver and sculptor who gave me many insights, and who effectively
									taught me how to <i>look</i>, that essential prerequisite of any artistic or skilled
									craftwork. Many times since then, and currently, even, I have regretted that I did
									not commit myself entirely to <i>that</i> particular channel, for I recognise that
									I could have been competent in several fields, and would have gained much satisfaction
									from my achievements.</p>
								<p>
									But with my spiritual awakening and the discovery of my healing talents, my eyes
									of compassion had been opened and I could not shut them again, no matter how hard
									I tried. My compulsion grew and grew as I realised what could be achieved. I have
									never been so egotistic as to believe that, alone, I could effect significant change,
									but nevertheless have persisted in learning, learning, and experimenting, in order
									to achieve the maximum of which I, myself, was capable, and to maintain myself as
									an effective partner in this human/spiritual exchange.
								</p>
								<p>
									One outcome of my study was that I learned or developed combinations of acupuncture
									points through which much could be caused to happen. This was especially so in the
									relief of pain. What a joy it was to be able to give even just temporary ease.
								</p>
								<p>
									George certainly stands out in my memory. He came and sat on my stool at the cancer
									centre, looking entirely robust, as robust as his attitude was to the death that
									he said was inevitable from the asbestos induced cancer that was destroying his
									pleura. Using chosen acupuncture points, I had developed a strategy that I could
									use to good effect in the all too short time that one had with each person. </p>
								<p>
									My first move was to use points called "Spleen 21", which are at the side of the
									rib cage. I put my hands there on George, and was startled to find close to the
									surface the cut ends of ribs, the result of his most recent operation. But what
									surprised me more when it came, was his gasp and exclamation as, almost with a whip
									crack, the constant and intense pain went. The down side was, of course, that the
									pain would come back, for one could not achieve much that was permanent in half
									an hour, once a month, and George had come from a distance, as I had, and we could
									not meet.</p>
								<p>
									What did persist within me and for some time was the combined effect of everybody"s
									contributions made throughout the day. Undoubtedly there was much input from spiritual
									sources, and one tried to play one's own part. On my windowsill, there is an object
									that constantly reminds me of these particular days, and the many people who came
									to the school. It is a small, conical glass bowl, into the surface of which is engraved
									the image of a pair of hands that are seemingly holding the empty bowl. The hands
									were fashioned for me by a Scottish lady, who has exquisite artistry in the art
									of glass engraving.
								</p>
								<p>
									The bowl and the hands represent what I saw as my role in some circumstances - effectively
									to hold a person in tranquillity while their inner "bowl" was filled. How I wished
									that the allotted times were longer, for some were so <i>transported</i>, were so
									obviously "elsewhere", that it often required a touch and the sound of their name
									to bring them back to awareness. How memorable and moving were the deep hugs and
									kisses of unspoken shared experience that sometimes accompanied these returns.
								</p>
								<p>
									What was perhaps remarkable was that of five of us who offered this type of healing,
									three had been "inducted" by Bruce Macmanaway! What an input that man had into this
									field, for within a small number of years, I had encountered yet three more, all
									within fifty miles of my home, as I shall relate.
								</p>
								<p>
									Yet, in spite of the high endeavours and dedicated motivation of most of whom I
									met, there were, nevertheless, individuals who seemed to have their own personal
									agenda directing what they did. I seem to be particularly na&iuml;ve in not recognising
									soon enough the female of this species. No purpose is served by revisiting such
									occasions of disillusion, but, with one such, when there seemed to be a friendship,
									I fell in with a suggestion that I should go and talk to a woman, who lived some
									distance away, and who gave so-called "readings" or "channelled".
								</p>
								<p>
									Green as grass I went, always expecting the best from a situation. Certainly the
									person in question could not have been more attractive or "wholesome", to use an
									old fashioned word. Within the family home we sat, while she talked for some considerable
									time, with a break for a snack. Her intentions were of the highest, and she believed
									implicitly in what she was doing and in the veracity of whatever it was that she
									was saying, while her demeanour was purity itself as she blessed each "spirit" that
									she could apparently "see" in her ambit. However, after I had listened for some
									time, I began to think, "This is a pointless load of twaddle" - and much more pungent
									thoughts. What surprised me was that these "irreverent" thoughts were not intercepted
									by the, one assumed, spiritual source of her "channelling", but that she went on
									talking in similar vein.</p>
								<p>
									I did not, as had been suggested, record her delivery, and on reflection, I am glad
									that I did not, for, of what I remembered, enough remained to have a long-term effect.
									There is a problem with being the object of such attempts at prescience, of "divination"
									or supposed spiritual analysis, for no matter how much one is saying to oneself,
									"This is a load of cobblers", inevitably some of what is said sticks in one's mind
									and memory, always to be on hand in an appropriate situation.
								</p>
								<p>
									For example when, having been told "I give you X and Y", these being names of people,
									but without any actual context, inevitably, no matter how hard one tries not to,
									when one meets an X or a Y, one thinks "Is this the one who was meant?" - and one
									starts endless speculation in spite of oneself. Or, "You will write a book in collaboration
									with someone who already has a reputation in your field" (not naming the field).
									Thinking that it was most likely that what I would want to write would be of a medical
									nature deriving from my work in healing, I said something about "a doctor". "I didn't
									say "doctor", but meant a professional person". So again, in spite of oneself, the
									speculation starts rolling whenever an apparently "suitable" individual crosses
									one's path, and even more confusing, as there were other topics on which I knew
									that I could go into print.
								</p>
								<p>
									I did not speak subsequently of this encounter to the person who had suggested that
									I should go, and kept my thoughts to myself. Whether this aggravated her, or what,
									I do not know; what I do know is that she began a vindictive undermining campaign
									against me among certain people at the cancer centre, which was most unpleasant
									to experience, particularly in what it revealed about the way in which <i>others</i>
									so easily allowed themselves to be influenced. However, fortunately, she was detected
									in her malice, and was hoist by her own petard. (I've always wanted to write that!)</p>
								<p>
									Unpleasant though it is to recall, I have done so in order to introduce the topic
									as a means of exploring the dangers of implicit belief in one's self as a "channeller"
									of "wisdom" or advice from an apparently etheric source. And also to explore the
									equally great danger of accepting from others the product of their activities, whether
									as channellers, clairvoyants, Tarot card readers, astrologers or practitioners of
									other forms of divination. It is important to consider this topic and all that is
									implied within it in great detail, for concealed in such seemingly innocent attempts
									at divination are other "channels", channels through which malevolent intrusions
									can enter people's lives and minds. This may appear to be a melodramatic concept,
									but I hope to demonstrate the truth of what I write when I discuss the topic in
									detail at a later stage.</p>
								<p>
									The turbulent and rapid passage of the river of the nineteen-eighties has whirled
									me past a number of topics so quickly that I have been able only to give them a
									brief mention - diet, acupuncture, geopathic interference, ion imbalance, electromagnetic
									fields - and some that I have been too "breathless" even to mention in passing,
									such as hypnotherapy and Alexander technique. To all these I shall return, and explore,
									and, hopefully, explain why I believe them to be important within all that I am
									trying to convey to those whose problem is within the mind, or with the spirit.
									Yes, inevitably, one cannot separate them - body, mind and spirit - and acceptance
									of that inevitability would be of immense benefit to anyone trying to regain control
									of a disturbed mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									In case you think that I have left behind my own struggle with spiritual intrusions,
									let me reiterate, as I do from time to time, they are always there in some shape
									or form. The actuality of these intrusions will emerge when later I present my records
									and analysis of these times. However, before I leave the comparative tranquillity
									of this eddy where we have been regrouping, and before I thrust out into the last
									brief turbulent flow of the decade, let me leave you to ponder one particular incident
									that was perfectly unique in the midst of the whole collection of the experiences
									of those ten years ...
								</p>
								<h4>Ley lines</h4>
								<p>
									I have written earlier of how I read and came under the spell of <i>The Old Straight
										Track</i> by Alfred Watkins. In his book, and briefly, he describes how he became
									aware of the concept that, long before the days of roads, wheeled traffic, large
									towns and enclosures as we know them, in fact, considerably before even Roman times,
									people communicated and travelled along straight-line routes. When one considers
									that all traffic would be on foot or by pony, with goods carried by porters or slaves,
									this would have been the most logical way to journey. However, the routes were not
									haphazard, but were predetermined by surveying, and, from my own analysis of routes
									in this area where I live, the surveying was remarkably precise. Watkins found that
									the routes passed through many places with "ley" in their name e.g. Hartley, Bentley,
									and from this observation, he named the alignments "ley lines".</p>
								<p>
									Identifying and walking some of these alignments in my own area soon became a key
									hobby, as I could, in fine weather, explore routes that I had identified from my
									maps in the long dark evenings of winter. It was for such an exploration that I
									went one evening in summer to take some compass bearings along a particular route
									that I wanted to explore later in some detail. </p>
								<p>
									It was a brilliant, sunny evening, and I clambered up an old peat track to reach
									a broad plateau, disturbing a feeding roebuck that quickly clattered away over rocks.
									The plateau is most interesting in itself, as it contains the site of an ancient
									Bronze-age settlement, although this was not my goal. It was an evening for just
									sitting and looking. Anyone familiar with the watercolours of W. Heaton Cooper will
									recognise the type of light that flooded the whole land - so lucid and transparent.
									I was totally alone and intent on observing the scene. A fox trotted leisurely across
									my view about 100 yards distant, only to turn away suddenly at right angles and
									run off at high speed, tail and ears low, escape imperative. Such breeze as there
									was drifted from me to the fox and, picking up my scent, it lost no time in putting
									as much distance between us as it could.</p>
								<p>
									However, I had come to take some bearings, and took out my compass. I had bought
									the best that I could afford, and took pleasure in it, a modern version of the much
									respected military prismatic marching and surveying instrument. I identified my
									distant point and put the compass to my eye, getting the sights truly on my objective,
									and then, totally to my amazement, the compass card, of its own volition, moved
									slowly and deliberately through ten or twelve degrees, and stayed there for a while,
									before slowly returning to the required bearing. </p>
								<p>
									You will recollect that in my profession I was an instrument engineer, and familiar
									with most aspects of measurement and measuring devices. I had already made sure
									that my spectacle frames were non-magnetic, even to the extent of having some minute
									screws replaced. I did a recheck on my jacket to ensure that there were no zips
									or metal buttons that could interfere, and that I had nothing in my pockets of a
									magnetic nature. I looked around to confirm that there were no wire fences nearby
									which could exert any influences. Satisfied with my checks, I put the compass to
									my eye again and settled on the distant peak. Once again the card moved, this time
									through fifteen degrees, and stayed there steadily for a significant time before
									returning slowly to the bearing of my desired objective.
								</p>
								<p>
									I pondered long as I packed up and came home, and have often done so since. I have
									used the compass many times in subsequent years with no repetition, and no, I do
									not drink, nor ingest any drugs or hallucinogenic substances. Having had the experiences
									of spiritual intrusion and body manipulation that I have described, I have no illusions
									about the "physical" power and actual presence of a spiritual domain paralleling
									and interacting with our own, and personally have no doubt that I was being given
									another demonstration of this ever-presence.</p>
								<p>
									So, there it is. As I ease the raft into the last turbulent flow that carries us
									into the broad river of the nineties, I'll just leave you with your own thoughts
									to ponder, and while you do so, perhaps you would like to read some verse that David's
									son-in-law Barry Applin wrote following a visit during which we wandered the hills,
									and I explained to him just what it was that I was seeking ...
