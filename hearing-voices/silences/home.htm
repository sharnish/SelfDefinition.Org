                                    It's simple! Selecting this link: <a href="introduction.htm">introduction.htm</a>
                                    will take you to the Synopsis and Introduction from where you can go on to the chapters of
                                    the book.
                                    <!--There is also a contact link, such as at the right side of this page,
									so you can write to me. The "Home" link is on every page, and slecting it will bring

                                <p>
                                    I recommend that you read the book chapter by chapter, as it has been written and
                                    presented. Each chapter is self-contained.
                                </p>

                                    Chapter 16 [<a href="loose-ends.htm">loose-ends.htm</a>]
                                    is not part of the actual narrative but will be an "organic" part of
                                    the book, subject to addition and change. It already contains the picture gallery
                                    that is relevant to Chapter 14 - it is recommended that Readers should
                                    print the illustrations for reference when engaged with these chapters - and the
                                    Bibliography.

                                    Born in South Wales, I spent my early years there, apart from four years wartime
                                    service in the Royal Navy. In 1950, I graduated from the University of Wales with
                                    a degree in Electrical Engineering, and immediately began work at the Sellafield
                                    Nuclear Plant, where I spent all of my working life. I retired early, and began
                                    an entirely new life developing my smallholding, and my interest in horses. Quite
                                    by chance, and following a seemingly innocent investigation and an interest in dowsing,
                                    a situation developed from which I began to hear voices.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That was in 1979, and to this day I have never been free from intrusions into my
                                    mind, or from intruding presences within my body. YES - INTRUSIONS. Because of what
                                    I was doing at the time, and from all that has followed, I have not the smallest
                                    shadow of doubt that my experiences result from spiritual intrusion into my mind
                                    and body. I have never been ill from this cause, although there have been difficult
                                    times. My purpose in writing is to inform and encourage – yes, to encourage those
                                    who are troubled by voices to believe that they can regain control of their minds
                                    and thoughts, and to help them to do so.</p>
