								<p>
									In the autumn of 1979 I began to hear voices and experience other phenomena, and
									have done so ever since. Thus in over 30 years, I have never been free from intrusions
									that enter blatantly or subliminally into my mind and mental faculties, and forcefully
									or subtly into my body and senses.</p>
								<p>
									I use the word 'intrusion' deliberately, for that is what they are - not the product
									of an aberrant mind nor of a diseased brain. Because of what I was doing at the
									outset in 1979, I have no doubt, not the slightest shadow, that what I experience
									is of spiritual origin. Use of the word 'spiritual' to some immediately suggests
									'religion', 'spiritualism', 'theology' and the like - words that to many are off-putting,
									and likely to prevent them from even opening my book. Forget such preconceptions.
									I am an engineer and my approach and language are those of an engineer - as precise
									and realistic as I can be within a realm of experience that is most imprecise and
									unrealistic.</p>
								<p>
									From the beginning I have kept notes, which from 1998 began to turn into coherent
									writing as I became computer literate. In my parallel reading from the field of
									mental health, I found what are called 'The First Rank Symptoms' of schizophrenia,
									and I realised that I had experienced them all, and recorded and written of them,
									albeit in my own words. Yet - and this is the most important point that I am desperately
									trying to make - I have never been ill from this cause, and neither have I, nor
									would I seek help or intervention from the world of psychiatry or that of religion.
									On the contrary, I write to inform those in both such worlds who endeavour to help
									the mentally ill and disturbed.</p>
								<p>
									As fast as I wrote, my words were read avidly by friends who work in the field of
									psychiatry. As they read, they wanted to know about 'before' - i.e. about my life
									before the onset of the intrusions. I realised that I should indeed write about
									'before', in order to separate it from the events of 1979 and what has followed,
									for apart from the fact that both sequences happened to me, they are totally unconnected.<br />
								</p>
								<p>
									What happened 'before' is a story in itself, and it forms the first part of my book.
									In 1961 I had a successful career in the nuclear industry - a career of which I
									was robbed through the consequences of a medical misdiagnosis, and inappropriate
									and unnecessary medication. What is now known to have been a Cryptosporidia infection
									was treated as if 'nervous', and I began a life with Librium. After two years continuous
									use, an addict, dependent, and showing many of the side-effects of the drug, I began
									a 'psychiatric' year that opened with two episodes of cold turkey, hospitalisation
									for a total of twenty weeks, 23 E.C.T.s, 'experiments' with a variety of drugs such
									as Tryptizol, Melleril, Valium Pertofran and assorted benzodiazepines and barbiturates
									plus insulin shock 'therapy' - and that ended with a farcical second opinion from
									someone who went on to become a doyen in the world of psychiatry.</p>
								<p>
									I retired early with my career and home wrecked, and in total, in real terms, I
									have lost over a half million pounds. But hard though it may be to believe, effectively
									I began a new life. It is a life that has been and is both fascinating and rewarding
									- even though after four years it included the events that then led to the spiritual
									intrusions. For, as I found out, not only are there the malevolent - the ones that
									plague the 'schizophrenic' - but there are also the benevolent.</p>
								<p>
									The whole story is there in the book - of how under the tuition of renowned healer,
									the late Bruce Macmanaway, I found that I also had a talent to heal. It is a talent
									that I have used hopefully to good effect, and which has brought me many rewards
									in encounters with wonderful people.</p>
								<p>
									My 'engineering' approach has led to a study of our interaction with the electrical
									environment, and an understanding of aspects of electricity and health. Becoming
									aware of the electrical nature of acupuncture I expanded my knowledge and experience
									in this field also.
								</p>
								<p>
									I identified over thirty different ploys that are used by intruding 'entities',
									and describe these in detail. I also realised that channels into the minds of the
									vulnerable can be opened via such activities as hypnotism and hypnotherapy, past
									life regression, Reiki, channelling and various forms of 'divination'. There are
									cautions, too, for those involved in spirit release, and many of the esoteric practices
									that involve 'opening the mind'.</p>
								<p>
									Among my heroes are such diverse individuals as Galileo, Paracelsus and Nikola Tesla,
									and I quote and draw conclusions from them as I do from the writing and communications
									of a wide variety of psychiatrists, psychologists and others in the field of mental
									health, such as Irving Gottesman, Julian Jaynes, Martin Roth, Kenneth McAll, A.W.Drummond,
									Wilson Van Dusen, Richard Mackarness - to name a few. I have also drawn from that
									well-known hearer of voices and seer of visions, Teresa of Avila.</p>
								<p>
									I am making my book freely available, for it is important that it is read. The only
									price that I ask is that you should use it or put it to use for others who are struggling
									within the morass that their mind has become, and that you should tell others of
									its Web address. I am now well over 80, and still have many other things to achieve,
									so I cannot undertake to respond to any or all communications, but will try. In
									the meantime I can join poet W.B.Yeats, and speculate -</p>
