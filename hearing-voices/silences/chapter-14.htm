								<p>
									In the same way that sixteenth century philosopher, Michel de Montaigne could assert
									that he himself was the "material" of his book of Essays, so, on reflection, have
									I myself become the core of mine. When I began to write I had no intention of writing
									a book - such an idea would have stopped me in my tracks.</p>
								<p>
									As with many journeys of exploration, a few tentative excursions revealed territory
									that invited further examination, and with the examination and exploration courage
									grew, fuelled by the encouragement I received from friends. Filled with this new
									audacity, and inspired by the view that I began to perceive, namely that of ultimate
									publication, I have gone on and on, arriving at this, which I hope will be my last
									chapter.</p>
								<p>
									At the very outset, the first words that I wrote were "I am one of the people least
									likely to write anything remotely autobiographical", and yet everything, yes everything,
									is just that. Beginning with descriptions of actual real time happenings, the words
									have accumulated, and just like a Christmas tree being dressed with care, they form
									the "presents" and "gifts" hanging from it, and that have come from the squirrel
									store of my garnered lifetime experiences and my understanding of these events.
									These presents and gifts are there for anyone to take and to use, either for their
									own benefit or that of others. Even though I have given all that I could from myself,
									strangely I do not feel diminished, but paradoxically I feel enhanced by the hope
									that some will find encouragement and incentive.</p>
								<p>
									Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the self analysis and personal revelation
									is that, apart from incidents and events that were played out in public situations,
									by far the greatest bulk of my writing relates to what was going on in my mind.
									Thoughts and self analysis are there now for all to read - but the spiritual exchanges
									that have pervaded all of these, and that are with me continuously, what of them?
								</p>
								<p>
									There is no "cloud" of activity buzzing around my head as is often seen in cartoons,
									and representing all that is happening within the skull. I don't adopt a particular
									stance or facial expression. When walking, driving, shopping; when engaged in activities
									ranging from the most mundane to the most intimate, there is often the inner exchange
									or intrusion and interjection. And not only into and within my mind, but often silently,
									mutely, <i>physically</i> into and within my body and senses.</p>
								<p>
									Yet I am but one of many billions who inhabit this planet - <i>an individual</i>
									- I repeat - <i>an individual</i>. My DNA is unique to me; likewise my fingerprints
									and the colours in the irises of my eyes. And had I not told you about them, the
									events that I have related would have stayed within the confines of my mind and
									memory; silent and also unique to me. Which is why I question so strongly conclusion
									about mental health and perceived problems of the mind that are addressed through
									studies of multiples of individuals.
								</p>
								<p>
									I keep returning, sometimes with mild sarcasm or criticism to the analysis of the
									lives of 50,000 Swedish conscripts, and to the conclusion that have been drawn from
									their behaviour that allegedly resulted from the use of cannabis. Already the study
									is being quoted widely in the context that "smoking cannabis can cause schizophrenia",
									and with 50,000 men having been studied, the sheer number is taken as giving weight
									and stature to the results of the analysis.
								</p>
								<p>
									And yet, totally ignored is the fact that drugs such as cannabis, mescaline/peyote
									are used by shamans and similar "seers" to induce a physical and mental state in
									which spiritual intrusion is desired and actively sought. Fear not, it is not my
									intention to go on and on in detailed scrutiny of other people's work, but rather
									to use it as a stalking horse to gain access to yet more thoughts of my own.
								</p>
								<p>
									Where does our uniqueness begin? At birth? Before? In the womb? Before? In his <i>Healing
										the Family Tree</i>, Dr. Kenneth McAll invites one to do just that, to look
									at the family inheritance to try to find the source of an "unquiet spirit" that
									persists in plaguing individuals of subsequent descent, and, in some cases, causing
									physical and mental illness.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										[from the back cover] "He believes that many supposedly "incurable" patients are
										the victims of ancestral control. He therefore seeks to liberate them from this
										control. By drawing up a Family Tree he can identify the ancestor who is causing
										the patient harm. He then cuts the bond between the ancestor and the patient by
										celebrating, with a clergyman, a service of Holy Communion which delivers the tormented
										ancestor to God."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									Many people, myself included, have problems with the conventional representation
									of "God", yet, in the context in which I am writing, we would do well to ponder
									the words of psychiatrist William James, who commented, "We and God have business
									together: in opening ourselves to his influence our deepest destiny is fulfilled.
									God is real because he produces real effects."
								</p>
								<p>
									McAll's book is both informative and provocative, and can lead one to a whole range
									of speculations. For example, and still considering the influences that can form
									a person in the womb, he treats of the case of a young man who lived under his mother's
									protection and feared any relationship not only with women, but with chaplains.
									Analysis and discussion over a period finally produced the revelation from the mother
									that while pregnant and continuing her work as a nurse, she had allowed intercourse
									to take place with one of her patients, an army chaplain.</p>
								<p>
									Many prospective parents play music to their unborn infants by such composers as
									Mozart, in the belief that there is something sufficiently significant in the music
									that can influence subsequent development. Who knows? Humans are the only mammals
									that continue to have sex after conception. This is obviously a conscious choice,
									and not the result of an evolutionary imperative.
								</p>
								<p>
									Indeed, searching the Web for any comments about "sex during pregnancy", I was surprised
									to see how many sites there are, and all promoting the desirability and "safety"
									of the practice - even, in one case, into the ninth month. Intercourse and orgasm
									activate just about every cell within the body, and must obviously communicate <i>something</i>
									to the foetus. Who can say what, and whether it is desirable for the ultimate development
									of the child?</p>
								<p>
									The emotional state of the mother-to-be in its general sense must be yet another
									strong influence on the developing child within. I am well acquainted with two people,
									now past middle age, both of whom were conceived out of wedlock when that was a
									serious cause for concern, particularly for the girl and her family. Discussion
									with both provides much insight into lifetime problems that appear to have their
									origins in that time, and not only during the actual pregnancy, but afterwards.
								</p>
								<p>
									In one, the father appeared to hold deep resentment against his daughter, as unwittingly
									she had been the cause of his enforced marriage. In the second, the behaviour of
									the mother towards her son seemed to stem from the fact that she had actually been
									"found out" in her misdemeanour, and that he was the constant reminder. One can
									only imagine what emotions must be coursing continuously through the mind of a girl
									in the times, seemingly now past, when the disaster of pregnancy struck - emotions
									that must be communicated to the child within. I remember vividly the comment of
									one friend in 1951 as we watched someone with whom we were well acquainted as, heavily
									pregnant, she set off for her wedding. My friend was from a small and traditional
									Welsh community, and all of her upbringing was contained in her deeply felt and
									expressed "Oh! The <i>shame</i> of it!"</p>
								<p>
									The child of the marriage developed cerebral palsy and I think that it is reasonable
									to speculate about the possible influence upon it of the state of mind of the mother,
									and wonder whether this contributed to the child's illness. Her parental home was
									at the other end of the country, and there was none of the support that would normally
									have been forthcoming from family in what in those days would have been a trying
									time. And a Registry Office wedding with four friends would have been vastly different
									from the wedding that most mothers plan for their daughters and that most daughters
									anticipate as they grow up.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is interesting to note, and not even remotely suggesting pre-marital conception,
									of the five children that I am acquainted with who were Down's syndrome, autistic,
									or had serious developmental problems, all were first born.
								</p>
								<p>
									I sometimes speculate on what might have been the state of mind of my own mother
									as she came near to giving birth to me. My arrival came twenty-two months after
									that of my brother, and, in giving birth to him, she had come close to dying from
									a haemorrhage, only being saved by the quick thinking and immediate action of her
									family doctor who attended the birth. Was she consumed with anxiety as my "time"
									came nearer? Did her anxiety communicate to me, and did it make me somewhat pusillanimous
									as a child?</p>
								<p>
									And what of my father? Apart from his obvious role in my procreation, if he
									had not found two bricks at the urgent insistence of the doctor who had delivered
									my brother, my mother might not have survived, and I definitely would not be here.
									The bricks propped up the foot of my mother's bed and helped to reduce her haemorrhage.
								</p>
								<p>
									And he gave me the Vincent genes. Very different from my brother who inherited the
									Matthews/Fortune variety -making us dissimilar even in something as fundamental
									as blood group - Bruce being AB while I am O. We grew at different rates until,
									as we were dressed alike, people took us for twins. But with his age advantage,
									he could beat me at almost anything - which is probably why to this day I detest
									board games.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, in another respect, we each had the same early imprint. I have never liked
									hyacinth flowers in the house - for some reason they always make me think of death.
									When, in our sixties, my brother and his wife were visiting, we were in a garden
									centre, and I heard her say "Will this be the year that you let me buy hyacinths?".
									It seems that he had the same aversion, and he knew, being older, that when our
									grandfather had died in our home, our mother had brought bowls of flowering hyacinths
									into the house to disguise any odour. I was about three at the time, and he five.</p>
								<p>
									My brother cried a lot as an infant, and when taking him out in his pram our mother
									used to hurry to where the trees in Major David's garden overhung the pavement -
									where he was pacified. The possible connection of this phenomenon and my mother's
									haemorrhage is something to which I'll return later as I expand my analysis.</p>
								<p>
									My present theme develops from an understanding of one of the many points of inheritance
									that I trace to my father and the Vincent gene. Not the belly that I have developed
									that matches those of my father, grandfather and Uncle Will; not the wavy hair that
									was both my pride and problem as I was developing my contacts with "girls" in my
									teens. None of those and the other similarities that prompted someone who was asked
									to guess who I was on one of my return visits to my former home. "Well it's obviously
									a Vincent", came the first approximation.</p>
								<p>
									From my father came this peculiar body electricity, knowledge of which, in my own
									case, came to the fore as my personal healing talent became apparent. It is reasonable
									to assume that the natural healing that he undertook, and that which had been performed
									by his parents, derived some of its force from this inexplicable part of our make
									up. My grandmother, in particular, was a powerful and much sought healer, and her
									untimely death that resulted from the effects of an accident was deeply regretted
									by many at the time. As a minor example, and before the advent of anti-magnetic
									watches, my father could not wear a watch on his wrist, for they invariably stopped.
									Whether they ever went again is something that I cannot recall.
								</p>
								<p>
									For me, the knowledge began to provide explanations for certain reactions and sensitivities
									that I have already alluded to, and which I am going to explore more fully. If you
									skipped all or part of Chapter 4, this, I am afraid, is where you may have problems.
									But to help you - and I hope that those who were obedient and read it will be tolerant
									- I may revisit and reprise some of the earlier points.</p>
								<p>
									It is impossible to ignore the fact that all life depends for its function upon
									electro-chemical and bio-electronic processes. You cannot ignore this and say "But
									I am only interested in the ultimate function, the intelligent processes of the
									mind, and the psychology of this person, this patient. Why should I even bother
									to consider any of the internal detail?" The reason is that this person, this patient
									is a totality - an individual totality; an electrical phenomenon that lives on a
									huge electrical machine, the earth, and interacts with - <i>everything</i>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Robert Becker writes of the <i>Body Electric</i> and its complexities, and <i>Crosscurrents</i>.
									Fred Soyka wrote of his mental and medical response to the varying concentrations
									of electrical ions in the air. Gustav von Pohl described vividly the illnesses,
									both physical and mental, that affected individuals who slept or worked in locations
									influenced by geo-electricity, as did K&auml;the Bachler in her seminal work, <i>Earth
										Radiation,</i>and as does Rolf Gordon in his book, <i>Are You Sleeping in a Safe Place?</i>.
									<span class="footnote">Ref: <a href="bibliography.htm">bibliography.htm</a></span>
								</p>
								<p>
									Becker began his research into the current of regeneration required to mend fractured
									bones, and ended with a wide analysis of the electrical function of various bodily
									processes. Along the way he confirmed that the acupuncture matrix that links all
									parts of the body and brain is, in fact, a series of subtle electrical circuits,
									and it is with this particular body-brain phenomenon that I will begin.</p>
								<p>
									"But", you may say, "Even if does exist, what possible connection can the acupuncture
									system have with mental health - and particularly with <i>spirit intrusion</i>".
									Here, and making allowance for simple translation from the original Chinese, are
									just a few sample conditions that are capable of being treated from various acupuncture
									points - madness, epilepsy, "alarm in children", vertigo, sadness, "stage fright",
									"a few days before menstruation cries, depressed anxious and nervous", "mental stupidity",
									"prone to fear and unhappiness", "wishes to remain at home", "does not wish to live",
									"walks around madly", delirium, insanity, forgetfulness, frequent weeping, "eyes
									move wildly", suicidal.</p>
								<p>
									Many in mainstream medicine dismiss acupuncture out of hand; others acknowledge
									the possibility of a limited role in analgesia, while GP friend "Harry" used to
									adopt the "Pavlovian dog" conditioned and immediate response, and come out with
									dire warnings about "getting hepatitis from the needles". Although it is not my
									intention to write a dissertation on the subject of acupuncture and the relevance
									to physical and mental health, an acceptance of its significance and an understanding
									of the complex "circuitry" interlinking every strand and function of the body, mind
									and senses, is necessary to be able to follow my argument.
								</p>
								<p>
									In acupuncture treatment, the goal is to try to restore the exquisite balance that
									should exist between the various parts of the matrix, called meridians, and between
									the two sides of the body. A corollary is that damage or distortion at the seat
									of an acupuncture point can act in reverse, so to speak, and has the potential of
									<i>causing</i> the very conditions that would be treated from the point.
								</p>
								<p>
									My purpose at this stage is to suggest various ways in which imbalance may be caused,
									and then to show how the intelligent sources of spiritual intrusion can exploit
									the resultant disturbed mind and body for their own inexplicable purposes. But more
									than that, I believe that this subtle "circuitry" provides the open door through
									which other forms of electrical interference enter, and hence widens the range of
									discomfort and inexplicable unease that can be exploited so easily.</p>
								<p>
									It is very easy to dismiss acupuncture and indeed many other branches of Oriental
									and Asian medicine as coming from "primitive" ideas and cultures, and to say that
									<i>real</i> medicine only began in Europe from about the eighteenth century onwards.
									Anyone with an interest in the inheritance from "the East" might find <i>The Genius
										of China</i> by Robert Temple to their taste. "3,000 years of science, discovery
									and invention" are described and analysed. For example, in engineering, the Chinese
									used techniques for deep drilling for brine and natural gas from before the first
									century B.C., while in medicine, as well as acupuncture there are early records
									that demonstrate knowledge of the circulation of the blood and of circadian rhythms.

								<p>
									Before I proceed any further, let me make it absolutely clear that I am not promoting
									acupuncture <i>treatment</i> as a remedy for the sorts of ailments that I am using
									as examples. However, an understanding of the whole system and its ramifications,
									and how, in a way, it parallels the distribution of the blood, will help me to develop
									my proposition. If the flow of blood to any organ or part of the body is inhibited
									and reduced from its natural level, inevitably disease will result.
								</p>
								<p>
									Regarding the acupuncture system as electrical circuitry carrying minute currents,
									there are many ways in which the "resistance" of a circuit can be increased, imbalance
									caused, and disease created. Remembering that I am an electrical engineer used to
									dealing with the minute currents that one had to measure in a variety of nuclear
									installations, certain reactions will be obvious to me that may escape others.</p>
								<p>
									Let me give some actual examples that may serve to illustrate one of the points
									I am trying to make. I was helped in the development of my thinking through an encounter
									with someone who practiced the <i>electrical</i> form of acupuncture. Diane used
									electrical measurements to detect imbalances between the various meridians.
								</p>
								<p>
									At the time that I met her, I had been pondering on the reason why so many women
									who developed breast cancer did so in the <i>left</i> breast. I had been going for
									some time to assist at one of the centres that offered the "Gentle Approach" to
									cancer, and of those who came for my therapy I only met one whose initial cancer
									was in the right breast. My original thoughts focussed on the wedding ring, for
									this reason: if an electrical conductor is surrounded by another conductor, then
									the current in the former will be reduced. Thus, I thought, the wedding ring might
									inhibit the normal flow in a meridian that has the peculiar name of the "Triple
									Heater" meridian, that begins on the ring finger and which is very closely associated
									with the endocrine system. Might this be the culprit?
								</p>
								<p>
									With Diane's help we first took measurements on a finger, and then repeated them
									with a ring in place, and found what I had expected - the measurement taken with
									the ring in place was lowered. The same results were obtained using close fitting
									metal bracelets, such as expanding wristwatch straps.</p>
								<p>
									I soon had a real demonstration with a woman who had a right breast cancer. As I
									applied my therapy I pondered "why?", and then had a potent response. Having comparatively
									little time with each person, I had devised a strategy that involved touching certain
									acupuncture points in sequence - sequences that usually concluded with points on
									the circulation meridians that are found on the wrist. My touching them actively
									stimulated the circulation and resulted in a feeling of well-being and warmth being
									felt by the individual.</p>
								<p>
									Pulling the sleeves back to locate the points, I found on her right wrist two tight
									gold chains that "I never take off". The chains had been in place since her teens
									and she was now in her fifties and they were tight to her wrists, though not so
									tight that they interfered with the circulation of the blood. Finding my points,
									which were above the level of the chains, I sat touching both arms for about five
									minutes. Her final comments as she left me were that she felt a lovely "glow" throughout
									herself - except for her <i>right</i> hand, which was stone cold. I tried to develop
									the ideas that I was formulating through discussion with a variety of people, but
									apart from a passing interest, active support was zero, and one soon gets tired
									at pushing at "closed door" minds.
								</p>
								<p>
									I first became aware of the possibility of a connection between "acupuncture" and
									mental health in relation to Alzheimer's disease. I had never actually thought about
									the condition until I saw on television a film called "Do You Remember Love?" It
									was a sympathetic depiction of the development of dementia in a middle-aged American
									woman university lecturer.
								</p>
								<p>
									At the time I could only name two individuals who had died from Alzheimer's. One
									was the film star Rita Heyworth, and the other was someone from the village in which
									I had formerly lived. Apart from being female, they had one important feature in
									common - they had both been dancers. The local woman had been a ballet dancer and
									had continued with dancing as she taught many young aspirants in our district.
								</p>
								<p>
									The thought that came to me on seeing the film and thinking about the two women,
									was that damage to the feet of a dancer is likely to occur frequently. This would
									be particularly so in someone who regularly dances on points, and bearing in mind
									that for many girls the urge to become a dancer develops early, when dedicated practice
									can soon distort feet that are still being formed. And so, unlikely though it may
									seem, I am proposing a link between damage to the feet and damage to the brain.
								</p>
								<p>
									I shall include diagrams of the feet in the final section in which I shall give
									other references. <span class="footnote"><a href="images-foot.htm">images-foot.htm</a></span>
									It will be a short section and so easy to print and refer to while reading this
									discussion. The meridians are named for the organs of the body, but are not specific
									to those organs when treating ailments.</p>

								<p class="footnote">Also see: <a href="gallery.htm">gallery.htm</a></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										Those involved on the feet are: Spleen, Sp; Liver, Liv; Stomach, S; Kidneys, K;
										Gall, G; Bladder, Bl.
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									I have listed only those points that are relevant to my argument, and would point
									out that while some of the conditions listed are not specific in the terms used
									in Western medicine, the descriptions are appropriate to my proposition.

									<p>

									In 1997 I responded to a broadcast on BBC radio 4 in which the discussion centred
									on the high proportion of professional footballers who were contracting and dying
									from Alzheimer's disease. The natural conclusion of the programme contributors was
									that it was heading the ball that probably caused the onset of dementia. My own
									assessment, based on the arguments above, was that equally with heading the ball,
									foot, ankle and shin damage are the most likely injuries sustained by footballers.
									Nervous depression, insanity, "suddenly becomes mad" are just three relevant conditions
									that could be treated from points on the lower leg.
								</p>
								<p>
									I also pointed out that of the inmates of a ward for demented women where I used
									to visit a friend, very few were likely to have headed footballs. A patient in Lancaster
									Moor Hospital, my friend had chosen to be placed in this particular ward because
									she found it to be quieter than the one that normally housed women with her range
									of problems. Of the women in the ward, one stood out in the context of my argument.
									About sixty years old, she walked around incessantly in stocking feet, revealing
									the most distorted bunions that one could possibly see. The big toe on each foot
									crossed the others virtually at right angles - Liv 2, K 1 and Point A being the
									three most likely to sustain damage.</p>
								<p>
									Visiting someone else in my local hospital, someone who was a patient in the geriatric
									ward, I overheard the nurse who was issuing medication say to one woman, who appeared
									to be marginally demented, that if she took her medication "the voices would go
									away". Did the dementia result from hearing the voices, or did the voices manifest
									as the mind became disturbed? Somewhat "chicken and egg" it would seem.

									As I have mentioned, scars from operations, trauma resulting from such as fractures
									and scar tissue left after accidental damage are all potent sources of imbalance
									in the meridians and possible causes of seemingly unrelated ill health. Scars created
									during hysterectomy have always struck me as major sources of a range of adverse
									conditions.
								</p>
								<p>
									While she did not have an actual hysterectomy, Esther, whom I wrote about much earlier,
									had a near equivalent in terms of scarring. You may recollect that she had a malignant
									tumour at the base of her brain, and prior to having radiation treatment along the
									whole length of her spine, her ovaries were relocated to minimise the possibility
									of her becoming sterile.
								</p>
								<p>
									On one of my visits, she agreed to let me photograph her abdomen with the relevant
									acupuncture points marked on it - you will find the picture in the final chapter
									as "Esther 1". <span class="footnote"><a href="images-esther.htm">images-esther.htm</a></span>
									Apart from the point at the right of the picture that I missed because she was laughing
									so much, all of the others marked are in true locations. As you will see, several
									lie directly along the line of the incision and the scars. What the long-term effect
									might have been I shall never know, for she died a year later.
								</p>
								<p>
									The points are associated with many vital female functions and the resultant emotions,
									and their disruption may account for some of the emotional trauma experienced by
									a proportion of women following hysterectomy. If the incision is made vertically
									up the abdomen it will be seen that several points would be affected, points for
									treating a similar range of ailments to the ones that I have mentioned, with the
									significant addition of one that would be used when "the patient wants to die".</p>
								<p>
									Esther also had deep exploratory surgery at the back of her neck in the vicinity
									of the tumour; surgery that produced scars through a number of major acupuncture
									points, one of which could be used to treat meningitis. The fact that she died from
									meningitis gives me food for thought.
								</p>
								<p>
									Living where I do, frequently I have visitors coming to stay, and inevitably I drive
									them around the district, for there is so much to see and so many places of interest
									to visit. Many of our routes run through the neighbouring valleys and dales, where
									the roads are very narrow, with acute bends and hills, moving through woods, past
									rivers, lakes and mountain waterfalls. At every bend of the road there is a new
									vista, and often we stop and the scene is viewed with an artist's eye, or that of
									a photographer, fell walker or angler - and the actual journey becomes as interesting
									as is the ultimate destination. After reading some of my writing, one of my visitors
									likened it to a recent trip that we had made in the car. She said that although
									she new what our intended destination was, the journey with its variety and many
									facets was equally delightful and she looked forward to returning to each of our
									intermediate points for a longer and more comprehensive visit.</p>
								<p>
									With my friend's comments in mind, let me try to define for you what I plan to be
									the ultimate goal of this episode. In earlier chapters I have described the variety
									of ploys used by spiritual intruders that I have identified, and I have referred
									to the varying circumstance in which the ploys are most successful in having a disturbing
									effect upon me. I have tried to demonstrate the fact that both the type of ploy
									used, and its coincidence with the undermining effects of external phenomena, show
									that the strategies derive from an intelligent source.
								</p>
								<p>
									Having referred in earlier chapters in an almost piecemeal way to the wide range
									of phenomena that cause disturbance, my plan now is to try to bring them together
									into a coherent whole. As I have commented earlier in the book, one cannot prevent
									the different winds from blowing, nor stop the moon in its track, nor yet eliminate
									earth currents, but one can minimise the emotional and other disturbance with the
									knowledge that the influence is outside oneself, that the effects will be transient,
									or can be avoided, and that one is not intrinsically mentally ill.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you have looked ahead to the final chapter in order to see the illustrations
									of the feet that are there, <span class="footnote"><a href="gallery.htm">
											gallery.htm</a></span> you may be wondering, and justifiably so, why there
									is a photograph of Esther's back, and several of nude models. Why, also, is there
									a drawing of a horse? <span class="footnote"><a href="images-horse.htm">images-horse.htm</a></span>
								</p>
								<p>
									It was the drawing of the horse in a book on equitation, and what it actually represents,
									that opened my eyes to the facts that I am next going to write about, and explains
									why the other pictures are also there. Anyone who has been involved in the initial
									training of a young horse will have become aware of one salient detail. The training
									usually begins with the horse being worked on a circle at the end of a lunge rein
									- a single long rein that connects the noseband on the horse to the trainer who
									stands at the centre of the ring. Once the horse has got used to the situation it
									is always found that it proceeds amicably and freely in one direction, but is reluctant
									to go in the other, and often tries to break back and circle in the direction in
									which it was comfortable.</p>
								<p>
									Those who farm red deer soon learn that the pens used to corral the deer have to
									be constructed with a clockwise lead, otherwise the deer will not "herd". Likewise
									sheep being gathered move calmly on a clockwise curve, and break away if turned
									anticlockwise. If you watch horse racing you probably will have noticed that when
									horses are galloping on a straight, they are actually running with their hindquarters
									offset to one side of the direct course. Likewise if you see a long dog approaching
									you on a straight path, you will undoubtedly see that its hindquarters are also
									offset.
								</p>
								<p>
									My good friends Tricci and Peter have over 150 milk cows. For record and identification
									purposes the cows have a number tattooed on one hip, and for some perverse reason,
									it is always on the cows right hip. Perverse, according to Tricci, because almost
									every time she has to find a particular cow by its number, the animal is lying down
									with the right hip underneath.</p>
								<p>
									In other words, as far as it is possible to observe free-ranging mammals, they all
									have a lateral curve as shown in the illustration of the horse <span class="footnote">
										<a href="images-horse.htm">images-horse.htm</a></span>. When animals in the wild
									appear on TV, I always keep one eye open for any evidence of the curve, and my greatest
									find was in a programme about orangutans. Centre stage was a venerable and solitary
									male, and as I watched, and it moved away from the camera down a straight path,
									plainly seen was the curve in the spine and a slightly asymmetrical walk or shuffle
									that matched it.
								</p>
								<p>
									Humans are mammals, and it is not very long in evolutionary time since we were quadrupeds.
									And yes, humans are born with a lateral curve. There are many ways in which it can
									be confirmed as I shall illustrate, although for reasons that appear to follow from
									our "domestication", some curve to their left and are left-handed, while the majority
									curve to their right and are right-handed. The two models are right-handed and are
									standing or sitting in a relaxed manner, and no doubt believing that they are upright.
								</p>
								<p>
									I took Esther's photograph shortly before she began the radiation therapy along
									her spine. She wanted to see where the radiographers had made their marks when planning
									her treatment. Esther was lying completely prone and relaxed, and was left-handed.
									I am right-handed, and will list the observable features for a right-hander. The
									most obvious is the left shoulder, which is higher; the left breast, also. If a
									shoulder bag or satchel is carried, it is almost invariably on the left shoulder.
									I have heard people say "My left shoulder is higher because I carried my school
									bag on it". The reverse is actually true - that shoulder was chosen because it was
									already higher, and the bag lodged on it more securely than the other.</p>
								<p>
									Ballroom dancers follow the majority handedness and always circle anti-clockwise,
									likewise skaters on a rink, although solo figure skaters usually demonstrate their
									handedness, left-handers going clockwise, and making their jumps, toe-loops and
									spins also in a clockwise direction.
								</p>
								<p>
									The most obvious difference between the two "hands" is usually not readily observed,
									and is only ascertained by asking the question "How do you wipe your bottom?" -
									guaranteed to produce an interesting reaction at a dinner party! There are two schools
									of bottom wipers - those who reach through between the thighs, and those who reach
									around behind. <i>Right</i>-handers who reach through, use the <i>left</i> hand,
									and as right-handers are in the majority, the left hand became the "cack" hand.
									It is much more obvious in the situation where one does not use a toilet seat, but
									crouches down to defecate; the curve of the body makes the left-handed reach through
									of a right-hander more convenient, and vice versa. (Conversely, reaching around
									behind for a right-hander is much more easily accomplished with the <i>right</i>
									hand.)</p>
								<p>
									As the body curve determines one's stance when throwing or when holding a sword
									and shield, the left foot comes forward, the shield is naturally held in defence
									on the left arm, while the sword is most easily wielded with the right hand. From
									this fighting posture, the sword hand became the "noble" one, and the left with
									its anus cleaning association, the "dishonourable" hand. Many books and articles
									have been written on the subject of handedness, and if I did not have to limit my
									discussion after introducing the topic and showing how it fits into my main theme,
									I could no doubt write another, for I have been making these observations for nearly
									thirty years.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have never seen any reference to the natural body curve in humans, whether in
									relation to handedness, or in any other context. So, remember, you read it first
									here, and as the explorers of old named islands, rivers and mountains after themselves,
									I shall name the curve "The Vincent Anomaly, Asymmetry, or Curve", and claim my
									rightful place in posterity!
								</p>
								<p>
									The views of the models' backs illustrate my reason for including them, and including
									them particularly within the total context of body asymmetries and differential
									stresses. Far from them having the smooth continuous curve that is seen in quadrupeds,
									the upright stance adopted by humans has served to divide the spine into a series
									of "chords" of curves.
								</p>
								<p>
									The lumbar spine is rigid, and has very little noticeable curve, although when observed
									in actual people whom I have studied, the intersection between the lumbar and thoracic
									vertebrae has been anything up to 3 cms off the centre line. "Sit up straight",
									"Stand up straight" - these are the commands one heard as a child, and so we attempted
									to comply, and caused a discontinuity between Thoracic 12 and Lumbar 1 vertebrae.
									The thoracic spine has a more noticeable and smoother curve, until it enters another
									discontinuity at the intersection with the cervical spine, where again attempts
									to obey the commands to sit or stand upright result in a kink.</p>
								<p>
									A spine that has more than its fair share of problems belongs to a young woman of
									my recent acquaintance. As she was being born her chin became caught on the inside
									of her mother's organ and she was bent severely backwards - there was no spare theatre
									for a caesarean section, and so there was a lot of cutting and pulling. "Vicky",
									now a young adult, has a number of emotional and behavioural problems some of which
									seem to stem from her difficult birth, and are particularly appropriate in the context
									in which I am writing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Her spine has the most peculiar double-jointed connection between the lumbar and
									thoracic elements, where there are two adjacent acupuncture points, one of which
									may be used to treat insanity and epilepsy. It also coincides with a point that
									has importance in Japanese medicine, and where treatment would be applied "to stimulate
									heart action, the kidneys, aorta, peritoneum and brain".</p>
								<p>
									There are other factors that take one back to where I wrote about the influences
									that can be created <i>before</i> the birth, and which might result from the stresses
									that can be created from pre-marital conception. This was the situation with Vicky's
									parents, and a reluctant bridegroom seems to have turned into a reluctant father,
									whose negative influence upon his daughter may add to those problems that seem to
									stem from the physical difficulties that I wrote about above. It is equally feasible
									that the stress of the pregnancy upon the mother may have been at the root of the
									difficulties experienced at the time of ultimate delivery.

									One does not have to watch TV for very long before one can observe the results of
									these asymmetries and imbalances in the speakers in front of one. TV gives a major
									advantage to the observer of human behaviour in that it allows individuals to be
									studied when they believe that they are behaving normally, and they can be stared
									at without embarrassing them or oneself. Many times I turn off the sound so that
									I can watch posture and expression without the distraction of the actual words.
									The slant of the shoulders and sometimes of the whole body, the breasts at different
									levels, the obliquity of the neck, and the tilt of the head are all there to be
									seen, and I can indulge in my personal guessing game of trying to decide if a person
									is left or right handed.</p>
								<p>
									At the base of the neck, and where the neck meets the skull at the atlas joint,
									there are acupuncture points that may be used to treat a number of serious "mental"
									and "nervous" conditions. Among the ailments listed are: hysteria, paralysis, limbs
									and body not coordinated, "St. Vitus's Dance", convulsions, epilepsy, neurasthenia,
									vertigo, "walks around madly", "eyes move wildly", suicidal. At the junction between
									the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae there is a point that may be used to treat - madness,
									epilepsy, anorexia.</p>
								<p>
									I derive personal benefit from the results of my observations when I want to achieve
									total relaxation. I lie supine on a firm surface in a posture resembling what Yoga
									practitioners call "The Corpse", in which they try to lie symmetrically about a
									centre line. Instead of trying to be symmetrical, I next arrange my body in a gentle
									curve from the top of my head to my feet, keeping my coccyx in place as my "reference"
									point. Being right-handed, the curve is concave to my right, and my head and feet
									are approximately 15 cms removed sideways from the original straight posture. The
									relaxation that I achieve is far superior to that gained when I simply lie symmetrically.
								</p>
								<p>
									Returning briefly to the role and status of acupuncture therapy, it is not something
									that can be dismissed, treated casually, or "learned" in a weekend "workshop". I
									have had treatments from two practitioners of Traditional Chinese Acupuncture. I
									went to them partly for prophylactic purposes and also to be able to experience
									the practice at first hand. Their training had been full time over three years,
									and had included half a year in China.
								</p>
								<p>
									In both cases, my first visit lasted well over an hour, and involved the most thorough
									analysis, testing and assessment that I have experienced in any form of medicine,
									apart from when my eyes were examined recently. As I recall, and for my own purposes,
									I went continuously for about ten weeks to each practitioner, and was impressed
									by the thoroughness of the practice. And contrary to "Harry's" dire warnings of
									hepatitis infection, the needles were either brand new from a sealed packet, or
									direct from the local hospital surgical sterilisation unit.
								</p>
								<p>
									For my own reference I use a book by Dr. Felix Mann - <i>The Treatment of Disease by
										Acupuncture</i> - his <i>Atlas of Acupuncture</i>, and <i>Acupuncture Therapy</i>
									by Dr. Mary Austin. The last one came out in paperback, but as it excluded much
									from the hardback that I considered invaluable, I would not recommend it. The Mann
									book also has different editions, the 1974 that I have being fully comprehensive.
									There are undoubtedly later works by different authors, but the ones that I have
									cited have filled all of my requirements.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Imagine a perfect skeleton" my physiotherapist friends were instructed during their
									initial training - and yet many years experience has told them that there is no
									such thing. "No one has a symmetrical face, and children's faces are the <i>most</i>
									asymmetrical" - so said my optician. Television, again, offers many opportunities
									for observing faces, with asymmetries ranging from the slight whimsical twist to
									the mouth, to the face that resembles a comma. Conversely, I have many opportunities
									for looking at the heads of animals - sheep, cattle and deer - where the horns and
									lugs stick out with complete symmetry.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are many reasons why the variations occur in humans, and there are a significant
									number of acupuncture points affected, points that could used to treat a variety
									of nervous and "mind" conditions. I have identified a number of "thought patterns"
									that over time can create some of the asymmetries, and in the fullness of my analysis
									in this book they have a significant place. Hopefully I shall be able to put them
									into a coherent form and include them later in this chapter.
								</p>
								<p>
									A persistent pattern of thought that occupies the mind for large parts of the waking
									life can create both body and facial twists and tensions, and over time can produce
									a wide variety of diseases. I have already described in an earlier chapter the way
									in which deep concentration can result in very limited breathing, and how this state
									can be created and exploited by various intruders into the mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									The very prolonged inner tension that results from personal distress such as occurs
									during emotional trauma can both be created and exploited by adverse intrusions,
									although <i>they</i> were not specifically involved in the very recent illness of
									a close friend, while prolonged emotional stress was. Her malignant breast lump
									was directly in the site of a significant acupuncture point - significant in that
									it is classed as a "Judo knock-out point". It occurred in the left breast at the
									point labelled Kidney 23, which is in the sixth intercostal space and about half-way
									between the sternum and the nipple. Among the ailments that could be treated here
									are: "cannot breathe", ulcer of breast, tumour of breast, anorexia, spasm of <i>rectus
										abdominus</i>.
								</p>
								<p>
									This last muscular "lock" is something that I have identified in myself during periods
									when I had been held in deep speculation or concentration by <i>them</i>, and when
									my breathing had been so shallow as to be virtually still.

									My persistence in following aspects of the acupuncture system is justified when
									one begins to interpret interaction with external sources of electrical stimulus.
									The analysis by Dr. Becker that demonstrated that acupuncture meridians behave like
									minute electrical conductors, takes one into a new realm of speculation. A moment's
									examination of your radio, TV or mobile phone will reveal the presence in each of
									an aerial. From the simple piece of wire or rod, to the more elaborate digital dish,
									they all have one purpose - to intercept "electricity" from the air, from the ether.
									The original term "Wireless" for the now more common "radio" says it all - the "wire-less"
									connection between source and receptor.
								</p>
								<p>
									Everything "electrical" that travels through the air does so as "electromagnetic
									waves". Most transmissions are intentional, as in communication, entertainment and
									ra-dar, or are accidental or adventitious as are the electromagnetic fields that
									occur around electrical conductors such as overhead power lines, or in the proximity
									of electrical equipment, machines or apparatus. In this environment the acupuncture
									meridian behaves as an aerial, and, by a process known as "induction", becomes activated
									with its own current.</p>
								<p>
									All waves have a frequency and wavelength - i.e. how many occur in a given time,
									and the distance from peak to peak. Normal household electricity has a frequency
									of 50 cycles per second - known as 50 hertz - and a very long wavelength. Modern
									radar and communications transmissions have frequencies of many millions of hertz
									- megahertz - and very short wavelengths, as low as millionths of a metre.
								</p>
								<p>
									In his book <i>Electromagnetic Man</i>, Dr. Cyril Smith describes how the wavelengths
									of some of these latter transmissions are of the same dimension as the cells of
									the body. He then describes how the intrusion of the radiation into the body can
									have a significant impact on the normal functioning of the whole nervous system
									sufficient to cause it to malfunction and produce physical and mental illnesses.</p>
								<p>
									I have illustrated how the acupuncture meridians can become distorted and restricted
									sufficiently to vary the electrical resistance and cause an imbalance within the
									system with resulting illness. This is one of the reasons why I have discoursed
									so widely on the subject of acupuncture.
								</p>
								<p>
									Apart from his analysis of the interference at cellular level, I don't think that
									Dr. Smith considered the mechanism through which the effects were created. I would
									find it very difficult to be specific about the "mechanism" through which the motor
									neurone disease of the other Dr. Smith, my late friend Sandy, was caused. Having
									measured the electromagnetic field in which he sat for many hours in his consulting
									room, there is no doubt in my mind that that was the cause of, or at the very least,
									a major contributory factor in the creation of his illness.
								</p>
								<p>
									Strong em fields featured in the daily lives of others with M.N.D. of whom I have
									been told - a man who spent a large part of each day operating a circular saw and
									another who was a professional wood turner, both men standing with a high-powered
									electric motor less than a metre from their abdomen. Was the field from electrical
									under floor heating involved in the death from M.N.D. of the close relative of one
									of my friends? Was the same type of heating a factor in the causation of leukaemia
									of one person, and the severe depression of another, both living locally?</p>
								<p>
									There is sufficient evidence that will, if examined without prejudice, implicate
									electrical fields from numerous sources in the creation or aggravation of many ailments
									of the human nervous system. I sometimes speculate on the possible adverse effects
									of these same fields upon a developing foetus. If a pregnant woman sleeps under
									an electric blanket, or if she works at an industrial sewing machine where the motor
									is very close to her womb - what then? Is the subsequent development of the infant
									affected? Is there permanent change caused to its nervous system? Is there the potential
									cause of future mental health problems?
								</p>
								<p>
									I grew up without electricity - our house had only gas, and apart from the work
									with the naval radar, I had minimal exposure until I reached twenty-five. Even for
									homes that had electricity, the occupants had only a little exposure themselves,
									for apart from a radio and possibly a very basic washing machine, the sources that
									would create em fields would have been few.</p>
								<p>
									Reviewing these times with my brother, we find it difficult, if not impossible,
									to recollect <i>anyone</i> of our acquaintance, adult or child, who had anything
									resembling the nervous and mental problems that beset many individuals today. We
									knew someone who became depressed and was hospitalised when abandoned by her husband
									coincidentally with the menopause, but only the one.
								</p>
								<p>
									No one amongst our school and teenage contemporaries exhibited any of the common
									problems of hyperactivity, depression, self-harm, suicide even, which trouble today's
									youth. There were the "dunces" of course, and we speculate on whether they were
									the dyslexics of our day. Asthma was rare, maybe non-existent; some kids had the
									inevitable nits, and some had ringworm, while most of us went through mumps, measles
									and chickenpox.
								</p>
								<p>
									We were spared the effects of too much electricity in that we did not have television,
									computers, play stations and mobile phones - we played "out" instead. We were spared
									the junk foods and all or most of the food additives - all of the E numbers that
									constitute so much of today's diet. Maybe the rose-coloured spectacles are working
									overtime, but truly, our lives had a happy "simplicity", until the war came and
									changed the situation - although it made our diet even more basic.</p>
								<p>
									As I wrote earlier, the effect of ambient conditions upon the developing foetus
									cannot be ignored when assessing the nervous and mental problems of the adult. Something
									that is insidiously present and potentially harmful is the "geo-electricity" that
									I have referred to in earlier chapters.
								</p>
								<p>
									I was briefly acquainted with one young woman who had developed muscular dystrophy
									at a very early age. While her mother was pregnant with her, the marriage was breaking
									up, and, as has been ascertained later, the parents slept in a location that was
									subject to severe geo-pathic influence, itself possibly a potent contributor to
									the aggravation between the parents.
								</p>
								<p>
									In yet another situation I used to join a friend when she baby-sat for her daughter
									who lived in a mobile home. Her grandson would cry incessantly, and struggled and
									struggled in his cot, pushing against the side with such effort that he developed
									a hernia. This is "classical" behaviour of an infant that is put to sleep where
									geo-electricity has a strong influence, as was the behaviour of the mother who became
									strongly verbally aggressive to my friend. Both the mother and the child became
									tranquil when they moved shortly afterwards. The behaviour of the two should be
									borne in mind by anyone considering the causes of "shaken baby syndrome", for the
									incessant crying of the infant and the aggravated and provoked state of the parent
									together make an explosive mixture that often has fatal consequences for the child.</p>
								<p>
									K&auml;the Bachler was a schoolteacher in Austria who became concerned that certain
									children in her classes did not achieve the potential of which she new they were
									capable - children who were often uncharacteristically disruptive. Becoming aware
									of the phenomenon of geopathic stress, and being taught by an experienced dowser,
									she began a programme of surveying and analysis of the classrooms that she used,
									and found, almost without exception, that the under-performing and disruptive children
									sat in badly stressed locations.
								</p>
								<p>
									Her book <i>Earth Radiation</i> describes her work and its consequences - consequences
									that, for example, resulted in the children being moved regularly in their seating
									so that no child spent long in the undesirable locations. Her work was treated seriously
									by the education authorities and formed the basis for her further research and grants
									under the auspices of the Pedagogical Institute in Salzburg, for whom she produced
									her "Research into the connections between geopathic zones of disturbance and academic
									failures in school children".</p>
								<p>
									It is almost worth reading the book for one entry alone. This is a commendation
									from the then Archbishop of Salzburg, who, after commenting favourably on Ms. Bachler
									herself, wrote:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"With her dowsing instruments she can find the "good places" and has thus helped
										many people including several priests and nuns of our archdioceses."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									After giving cautions about the misuse of the "divining" gift, the Archbishop continued:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"If however a Christian wants to do God's will and protects himself with prayers
										when doing radiaesthesic works and uses his or her instruments only in a helping
										way, based on love, when examining houses and finding water, then this work is blessed
										by the Church. In this sense I can recommend unreservedly and warmly the work of
										Ms K&auml;the Bachler, and especially her book."</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									The commendation does two things - it acknowledges the existence of the phenomenon
									and the use of dowsing to locate good and bad places, and, importantly in the overall
									purpose of my book, it acknowledges the potential for "evil" work and the existence
									of the spiritual component in dowsing. The Bachler book itself contains many authenticated
									case studies and analyses - and is unfortunately now very rare. The last time that
									I searched the Web I found a site where someone was proposing a reprint. If you
									are interested, I suggest that you search using just the author's name.
								</p>
								<p>
									Emphasis is usually placed upon the "bad", the stressed zones; however, it is important
									that one should remember that there are others that are specifically good, and can
									create well-being. I am fortunate that quite by chance I have found such a place
									to live, and remember well the comments of Bruce Macmanaway when he dowsed the house
									for me - they were to the effect that if anyone was actually seeking somewhere to
									practice healing work, they would be hard put to find somewhere better. Most of
									my visitors relax on arrival and almost all invariably have excellent sleep. Left
									to themselves, animals will find places that feel good to them - on some farms there
									are even recognised places where female animals will go to give birth - although
									it is well recorded that <i>cats</i> are happiest in places that are harmful to
									humans.</p>
								<p>
									I came to the field of "earth currents" as a sceptic - that is until I experienced
									the reality of them for myself. First in the home of my friend John whose leukaemia
									developed during the time that he slept in the bed in which I found it impossible
									to sleep - the fact that his first marriage broke down when that had been the marital
									bed came as no surprise. Then in the flat where Esther lived with her partner, and
									at the head of the bed beside which no plants thrived, where I felt distinctly nauseated
									and where the pair woke following "teeth grinding nightmares", "with a heavy weight
									on the chest", "feeling very depressed", where Esther developed a brain tumour -
									and which all changed when the bed was moved, although far too late for Esther,
									who sadly died.
								</p>
								<p>
									And again in the home of my cousin in Carlisle, where my own reaction was to experience
									severe backache, and where my cousin developed crippling muscular rheumatism - for
									which the only remedy seemed to be steroids and more steroids - and I curse when
									I recollect the sight of this lovely, caring woman bending more and more forward
									as her spine disintegrated and she could no longer breathe, and died. (When I wrote
									of my cousin in an earlier chapter I also noted that the friend with whom she shared
									the house had developed persistent and aggravating teeth grinding, which is commonly
									experienced in geopathic places, and that the friend's dog would not remain in the
									badly stressed room, which again is typical.)</p>
								<p>
									I feel considerable anger when I reflect that there are so many serious physical
									and mental illnesses whose origins may be traced to a variety of electrical, electromagnetic
									or simple magnetic influences, and when I realise that there appears to be no coherent
									or coordinated research into these phenomena. In his book <i>Chemical Victims</i>,
									Dr. Richard Mackarness refers to the "Society for Clinical Ecology" that had been
									founded in 1965. The society worked for an understanding of the influence of food
									and environment upon the health of individuals, but seemingly, unless the objectives
									have changed, restricted to the influence of substances. My concern is that that
									is only a part of the total picture, a picture that will not be nearly complete
									until the electrical environment in all its aspects is added to the "chemical".

									Within the last twenty-four hours I have had a potent demonstration of how the whole
									planet is, in fact, a "whole" and that "no one is an island". Yesterday (21 May
									2003) I said to a friend that because of the way that I felt, I expected there to
									be an earthquake soon. This morning the news bulletins were full of descriptions
									of an overnight major earthquake in Algeria.
								</p>
								<p>
									Several things had come together in my perception. The first was the way that I
									felt, which is very difficult to describe except to say that there was something
									"electrical" going on that past experience has shown me is associated with a major
									earthquake or volcanic eruption <i>somewhere</i> in the world. The second "notification"
									came from the poor performance of my television, in that several normally reliable
									satellite channels were playing up, while terrestrial channel reception was frag-mented.
									Thirdly, the disposition of the moon and major planets in combi-nation was likely
									to contribute to significant variations in the "pull" upon the earth - often coincident
									with an earthquake or eruption.</p>
								<p>
									I did not write that to demonstrate that somehow I have "extrasensory" powers or
									anything of the sort, but rather to indicate that, to someone who is in tune with
									his environment, subtle changes may be sensed, changes that experience can allocate
									to a source. But just as a particular radio signal may be masked by all of the noise
									and chatter over the airways, so the effects that I have referred to are easily
									masked by all of the pollution experienced in urban and industrial living.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I was still in work, I might possibly have gone to the medical department with
									a complaint that would have been recorded as "general malaise", and been content
									with an analgesic of some sort. In times past I may have believed that the analgesic
									had "worked wonders", whereas the <i>actual</i> cause of my discomfort had simply
									moved away.
								</p>
								<p>
									The whole episode illustrates why I continue doggedly - almost obsessively - describing
									and analysing the various natural phenomena. From my experience, observation and
									subsequent analysis I <i>know</i> that there are many individuals who respond in
									a similar manner, but who, not knowing the cause of <i>their</i> "general malaises",
									might become disturbed. This may be particularly so for those who are undermined
									or distressed in different ways, who just might be pushed "over the edge" by feelings
									that they cannot understand.</p>
								<p>
									Certainly I know that such times and occasions are fully utilised by the intelligent
									intruding entities to aggravate and provoke in the ways that I have described earlier.
									Equally I know that there is no medication yet devised that will have any real effect
									on the sufferer. The children studied by K&auml;the Bachler were not aware that
									they were being studied and so did not "jump through hoops" that were held for them;
									the plants in Esther's flat reacted without prompting, as did the dog belonging
									to by cousin's friend; the female animals seeking good places to give birth were
									doing so because it felt good, and not for any other reason that might spring to
									mind.</p>
								<p>
									Geo-electricity exists - of that there can be no question. The real question is
									- when will the reality be accepted by mainstream medicine and psychiatry, and then
									be incorporated into an understanding of the role that geopathic stress plays in
									the causation of many illnesses of the body and mind?
								</p>
								<p>
									Much damage has been caused by the blurring of the reality and actuality of a true
									electrical/electromagnetic phenomenon with another reality - the "ley-lines" of
									Alfred Watkins. As I have written, the name "ley-lines" has been hijacked by those
									who are intent upon surrounding the two phenomena with magic and mystery. In the
									context in which I am writing I beg you to abandon and forget any link that you
									may have had in your mind with "ley-lines", and accept and work with the reality
									that is geo-electricity and the <i>observable</i> evidence of its presence.
								</p>
								<p>
									The fact that dowsing is the easiest way of locating earth currents discourages
									many people; if this is so in your case, I suggest that you should re-read the statement
									from the former Archbishop of Salzburg, Dr. Karl Berg, a statement of understanding
									and approval that would not have been issued lightly.</p>
								<p>
									The harm caused by geo-electricity may be due to direct "radiation" or to the fact
									that the desirable negative ions are repelled from the zone, with a consequent high
									concentration of positive ones. When I wrote earlier linking my mother's haemorrhage
									and my brother's incessant crying, this is what I had in mind. The house in which
									they lived and in which my brother had been born had been built on land that had
									been reclaimed from a fresh-water marsh that was still influenced by the surges
									of the water in a nearby tidal inlet. I speculate that there remained underground
									aquifers that created the currents and a resultant pos-ion concentration.</p>
								<p>
									Referring to the <i>Ion Effect</i> book, failure of blood to clot with resulting
									haemorrhages, and incessant crying of infants are two common results of such a concentration.
									My brother ceased crying when he arrived under the overhanging trees - trees that
									are well-known creators of negative ions, and a pleasant relaxed feeling - witness
									the pictures one can often see of Chinese practicing T'ai Chi out of doors and almost
									invariably under trees.</p>
								<p>
									K&auml;the Bachler wrote exclusively about underground water. Gustav von Pohl accepted
									the other major generator of earth currents - the rotation of the earth itself.
									Rolf Gordon in <i>Are You Sleeping in a Safe Place? </i>illustrates the "Curry Grid"
									and the "Hartmann Grid" - two groups of "force lines" that are created by the rotation
									of the earth, and he and von Pohl both give details of case studies reflecting the
									types of malady that result from time spent in the adverse zones. Von Pohl also
									describes other observable effects that result from the presence of strong earth
									currents - effects discernible in the growth of trees and the striking of lightning.
									He illustrates how certain trees are stunted and die, while other species thrive,
									or yet others grow lopsidedly in an effort to avoid the harmful zone.</p>
								<p>
									I had a practical demonstration of this effect in one of my own pine trees. Its
									growth where it left the ground was almost horizontal, recovering in a long curve
									then to grow upwards. Because all of the other trees - probably planted 150 years
									ago - are sturdy and upright, I conclude that they were all looked after properly,
									and that the twisted growth was an aberration. The significance became very obvious
									when I had my field dowsed at the time that I was planning to have my borehole sunk.
									The dowser's reaction as he passed over the line that we ultimately chose was most
									remarkable to see as he and his twig vibrated violently. The line passed under the
									original planting of the pine tree, and it now became obvious that the tree had
									tried to grow away from it. Directly across a narrow minor road that skirts my field
									and where the line of the aquifer continues, there is a gap in the hedge where nothing
									will grow, although the rest of the hedge flourishes.</p>
								<p>
									Von Pohl declares that lightning strikes most frequently at the point where two
									of the grid lines cross. This effect was dramatically observable in a house that
									I have visited several times. My original visits were to a friend who lived there.
									As a widow, she had married someone whose wife had died of cancer while living in
									this particular house. In time, her new husband developed cancer and died, while
									she herself experienced a recurrence of cancer, having been cured of an earlier
									attack, of which she had been declared free for several years. Quite by chance I
									became acquainted with the new occupants of the house, and visited them on a number
									of occasions.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was during one of these visits that I felt the same unpleasant internal reactions
									that by this time I associated with geopathic stress. Some little time later, I
									was told of a remarkable lightning strike - their dog, while in the kitchen, had
									suddenly become very distressed, and shot out into the garden, when, moments later,
									the house was struck and a strong flash flew from the light fitting in the kitchen
									ceiling down to the floor. The husband has since developed a serious thyroid condition
									for which there is no obvious explanation, which, again, may be the result of living
									in a stressed location.</p>
								<p>
									The reaction of the couple has been revealing and exhibits a phenomenon that I have
									observed in others. They are very enlightened in their attitude to health matters,
									teachers in the field of naturopathy, and very aware of the existence of earth currents.
									Yet when it comes to the application of the knowledge to their own health, they
									exhibit a total blank, a blindness, or maybe a determination not to, or to want
									to see.
								</p>
								<p>
									I met a similar response when I raised the topic with the husband of a woman whom
									I had met at the cancer centre where I had helped. She had leukaemia, and where
									they then lived on the Fylde coast there was an almost identical situation to the
									one where my mother and brother had lived. I described earth currents and geopathic
									stress to the husband and gave him the Gordon and von Pohl books to read. However,
									on the next visit to the centre, he returned the books, unread. He said that he
									did not want to consider the possibility that their house might be subject to the
									phenomenon, because <i>he didn't want to have to move</i>!
								</p>
								<p>
									Whether or not the house had an effect upon his wife's illness was immaterial -
									they were putting such a lot into the house and he liked the location. Likewise
									the possibility that his own health or that of the two young daughters might suffer
									just did not penetrate the self imposed blindness and determination to ignore what
									I was trying to tell him.</p>
								<p>
									In the realm of spiritual awareness that is the mainstay of my book, I remember
									an occasion when I had described some of my experiences to my nephew. He had already
									established a dogged determination not to accept <i>anything</i> of a "spiritual"
									nature into his life or beliefs, and had one, and one only, repeated response to
									my description.
								</p>
								<p>
									The response was to the effect that "<i>it had happened to me</i>". I kept saying
									"that it had happened" - meaning that the phenomena that I had experienced had a
									much wider relevance than solely within the confines of my life; that what had happened
									to me was not specifically unique to me, but had consequences for others, whereas
									Mark wanted to treat them as if they were somehow completely encapsulated, and had
									no significance to him, his beliefs or the way he should live.</p>
								<p>
									The "earth radiation" of K&auml;the Bachler depends upon the presence of an underground
									aquifer - and don't dismiss them as being rare; they are not. As I sit now I can
									look along the length of both of my fields, and can recollect the first visit of
									the dowser, when he surveyed them. He had arrived with some of his children, and
									we all carried bundles of canes or sticks. As he walked at a steady pace, holding
									between his two hands a forked twig that he had pulled from my hedge, we saw the
									twig keep dipping at frequent intervals, indicating points where one of us stuck
									a cane into the ground. Back and forth he went, with yet more canes being inserted,
									as the lines of the aquifers began to be revealed, each with its own "hedge" of
									canes.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the smaller field, which is about 100 metres long and where the borehole is sited,
									Jack located four crossing lines. The day before the drilling rig was due, I had
									asked him to return, because I began to worry that my chosen line might also be
									the one that fed the spring at the farm of my neighbour down the hill, and I didn't
									want to alter his flow. So diligently we followed the respective lines, finding
									that my chosen one veered past the neighbour's farm, while the aquifer feeding his
									spring also ran diagonally and passed under my field at an unlikely looking place.
									Finding the line of that particular spring explained why there was a gap in the
									growth of our dividing hedge over which we had had a dispute some years previously!</p>
								<p>
									The actual drilling of the borehole was one of the more memorable events of my life.
									During the night I had suffered all of the qualms of doubt that accompany a journey
									into unknown territory. It was November, and the day dawned wet and windy - and
									prolonged rain had made the field with its clay soil become very slushy. The heavy
									rig soon got bogged down, and it took heroic efforts by a neighbour with his tractor
									to manoeuvre it into position. A huge compressor had been deposited beside the road
									the day before, and that soon sprang into life, alerting neighbours who came to
									join some other friends who had also come to see the fun, as well as Jack the dowser
									whom I had invited. The drilling started and went through some surprising layers
									- 5 metres of solid clay, then absolutely dry sand and pebbles that gradually aggregated
									into sandstone, until, as the sandstone was giving way to granite at 25 metres,
									a blast from the compressor brought a huge geyser of water jetting up into the sky.
									Water strike!</p>
								<p>
									The rest, as they say, is history. But strange was the attitude of some, in that
									knowing that such a good water strike ("The best I've seen in the Lake District"
									- said the pump man) had been located by dowsing, and seeing the dowser demonstrate
									on other lines, they nevertheless said "Oh, if you drilled <i>anywhere</i> in the
									field you would be bound to find water." When I offered to let anyone drill <i>anywhere</i>
									there were no takers, but still the dogged determination <i>not to believe</i>.
									Exactly the attitude adopted by my nephew, and, regrettably, the attitude taken
									by some who, having been told of all that had happened to me, all that I have described
									in the book, are still stubbornly determined <i>not</i> to accept what I am describing
									from my actual experience, and are prepared to continue with what are nevertheless
									far-fetched "explanations" of their own.</p>
								<p>
									Late on the second day, the rig was hauled off the land, the compressor fell silent,
									and everyone departed, leaving a field that resembled a World War 1 battlefield,
									and a half metre of pipe sticking up from the mud where the borehole began. The
									dowser is a farmer, who had learned from an uncle who had dowsed for water in the
									desert when in the army and in North Africa. As with most people with a true natural
									gift, he would accept no payment. Perhaps his most lasting payment is the constant
									gratitude that I feel each time that I turn a tap and out pours the ice-cold, pure,
									unadulterated water.

									The running water in the aquifers can create its own current, and also act as a
									conductor for electricity created by other natural means. I wrote earlier of the
									"battery" effect at the interface of two dissimilar rock types, or between rock
									and mineral deposits. Where such a battery exists, the current will flow and create
									its own geoelectric field directly above.
								</p>
								<p>
									On a far greater scale are the currents created by a phenomenon that was only discovered
									in the last year of World War ll. Pilots on high level bombing runs over Japan found
									that they could not hold on their targets because of a high-speed wind that blew
									from west to east with velocities of up to 500 kilometres per hour. Investigation
									and research over half a century have revealed more information about what have
									become known as the "jet streams". Very fast flowing currents of air snake from
									west to east over the middle and upper latitudes, carrying with them the components
									of the weather systems that make Western European weather so variable. An equivalent
									set of streams flows along similar latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
								<p>
									During daylight hours, the air at the altitude of the streams is ionised by the
									sun's ultraviolet rays. The resulting electrically charged particles are whisked
									along at very high speeds and together form a continuous electrical current that
									can reach a magnitude into the millions of amperes at local noon. At nightfall the
									ions recombine, and the current falls to zero.</p>
								<p>
									In considering the impact of electromagnetic radiation on people I mentioned earlier
									the process of "induction", where a current is induced in a conductor from external
									sources. The very strong current flowing parallel to the ground therefore induces
									electrical flow in the underground water streams, with the consequent geoelectric
									stresses. The major differences between day and night may account for some of the
									behavioural changes that are noted in some individuals.
								</p>
								<p>
									The movements of the jet streams (in the northern hemisphere) to the north in the
									spring and south in the autumn, probably explain some of the seasonal changes that
									take place in sensitive people. These might be a component of the influences that
									provoke the suicides that increase in number in the spring, and trigger the onset
									of depression in November.</p>
								<p>
									It is almost impossible to separate the phenomena of earth currents (see: <i>telluric
										currents</i>), <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluric_current">
											[Wikipedia]</a></span> geopathic stress and ionisation of the air. Where
									their existence has been accepted and the results of study incorporated into medical
									thinking, a greater understanding of aberrant human behaviour has resulted.
								</p>
								<p>
									Two of the books from which I have quoted frequently, have their origin in the same
									part of Central Europe, and, from the more recent Bachler book, there is evidence
									of the knowledge of earth currents being incorporated into official thinking and
									action. Whether this demonstrates a different attitude to ideas that are a little
									offbeat it is impossible to say, although in other perhaps parallel areas of medical
									thought, there is evidence of a ready acceptance of treatments that simply do not
									exist in other countries such as Britain.
								</p>
								<p>
									Digressing from my main theme, but still continuing with thoughts about personal
									and mental health and differences of attitudes and treatments between nations, I
									want to comment on a herb that is part of the accepted pharmacopoeia in such countries
									as Germany and Austria, but which has no official recognition in Britain. I refer
									to hawthorn - <i>Crataegus oxyeantha</i> - otherwise known as "mayflower".
								</p>
								<p>
									Following my recovery from my disastrous encounter with prescribed drugs, I determined
									that wherever possible I would take responsibility for my own well-being, and follow
									my own path. Commencing with the comfrey that I have already noted, I began a thorough
									study of common herbs and their properties. Hawthorn was one that soon came to the
									fore as I confirmed practically for myself the properties with which it is credited.
								</p>
								<p>
									It chanced that I first read of its characteristics at a time when the bushes in
									my hedges were in full bloom. I collected some of the blossoms, which are the most
									effective part, and incorporated them in tea that I was brewing. Just as it became
									ready, my friends Des and Carol arrived by chance and joined me in this trial. In
									almost no time at all, Des was fast asleep in a chair, and when later he arrived
									home, he rang to say that he could have been had up for "driving under the influence
									of hawthorn"!</p>
								<p>
									That, in a nutshell, illustrates one of hawthorn's most valuable properties - it
									acts "to re-establish the equilibrium of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous
									system on which depend the proper functioning of all our organs and our rest." So
									writes Jean Palaiseul in my well-used copy of <i>Grandmother's Secrets</i>. It is
									one of the most delightful and useful books that I have ever owned, combining as
									it does factual information about the natural substances, with family and historical
									anecdote. I would never be without it and refer to it frequently.
								</p>
								<p>
									Continuing to write of the properties, Palaiseul notes - "The ancients used it as
									a remedy for gout, pleurisy, vertigo, insomnia, angor; and modern science confirms
									that its chemical components are in fact antispasmodic, sedative, diuretic and above
									all constitute a remarkable regulator of arterial blood pressure as well as a valuable
									heart stimulant with excellent sedative effects upon the cardio-vascular system,
									and therefore on angina pectoris and disturbances of circulation whether due to
									the menopause or not."</p>
								<p>
									I could go on, recounting the way that hawthorn is valued and venerated in popular
									culture - but not in Britain! Why? Because of the Reformation! Flowering in May,
									the month dedicated to the Virgin Mary, hawthorn was "her" flower and herb, and
									its benevolent properties were ascribed to her influence. When, with the Reformation,
									all veneration of Mary was condemned and forbidden, propaganda proclaimed hawthorn
									to be the devil's herb and any contact with it was deemed unlucky. I shall not lightly
									forget the eldritch scream that came from the mouth of one traditionalist visitor
									who arrived just as I was taking some flowering hawthorn into the house - predicting
									all sorts of malevolence that would descend upon me as a consequence!</p>
								<p>
									I have used it along with meadowsweet as my "blood and heart" prophylactic for nearly
									twenty-five years, with not a single noticeable side-effect - which is another feature
									of hawthorn, the only caution being that one should not use it if the blood pressure
									is already low. Meadowsweet - <i>Spiraea ulmaria </i>- "Queen of the meadow" - is
									one of the original sources of aspirin, and an anagram of part of the specific name
									"spiraea" became in fact, "aspirin", and I use it regularly instead of a daily aspirin
									tablet.
								</p>
								<p>
									I did not give blood until in my fifties because of the cocktail of prescribed drugs
									that I took. When the "pollution" had cleared from my system, I went regularly to
									blood donor sessions. On the first few visits, my blood flowed sluggishly - at one
									time so slowly that the session was abandoned. However, soon after I began my regular
									use of these two herbs I went to another donor session, and commented to the doctor
									as he put in the needle that my blood came reluctantly. "Oh, you're one of those
									are you?" he grumbled, and then as the needle entered the vein - "Oh no, this will
									be a two minute job" - and it was, as the blood came freely and fluently.</p>
								<p>
									While writing so enthusiastically about hawthorn and its benefits, I do so to illustrate
									its effects upon myself, and what I have learned about it. I would never presume
									to advise or prescribe for anyone else, for such is not my practice. I have found
									the herb to be nothing but benevolent with not a single side effect, and value immensely
									its gentle tranquillising properties. The unravelling of the "knot" that frequently
									tightens my solar plexus, and which is part of the legacy of my earlier benzodiazepine
									drug regime, has to be experienced to be believed.
								</p>
								<p>
									For those who use their sexual function (or lack of it) as a measure of the state
									of their active health, all I can say is that my function and "potency" are as good
									as they have ever been, which is probably due in no small part to the vaso-dilating
									properties of hawthorn and to its ability to unwind inner tensions via the sympathetic
									and para-sympathetic nerves. I laugh when I read of the much-trailed "sexual dysfunction"
									in males and now females, and hear in my mind the chink of money landing in the
									coffers of the pharmaceutical companies as they generate anxiety in both sexes about
									their potency or prowess. Properly used, hawthorn would probably relieve most people's
									problems.</p>
								<p>
									At one time I use to collect and freeze the berries, but latterly have obtained
									my dried herbs from a main supplier - Midland Herbs and Spices - or as tinctures
									from the "Herb Company" in Scotland (01807 590 303), who, along with many reputable
									herb companies, supply standard strength tinctures from acknowledged apothecaries.
								</p>
								<p>
									From time to time various bodies in mainstream medicine mount campaigns against
									the use of herbs, discounting their efficacy, and often "discovering" new and "highly
									dangerous" side effects. A moment's reflection will demonstrate the fallacy and
									farce of these campaigns - one simply has to refer to the facts relating to prescribed
									medicines.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the most frequently listed causes of death is given as that resulting from
									those self-same prescribed medicines - and when one looks at the side effects of,
									for example, one of the more commonly prescribed anti-depressant types based on
									fluexotine, one can only gape wide mouthed and incredulous, and understand full
									well why large numbers of individuals are made ill simply by taking them. What herbal
									remedy properly used has the potential to cause "visual disturbances, palpitations,
									mania/hypomania, tremors, loss of sex drive, antisocial behaviour, double vision,
									memory loss etc, etc"? And what herbal remedy fills hospital beds just as they are
									filled with people who have been made ill by prescribed medicines?</p>
								<p>
									I have described above only one substance, hawthorn, that is capable of giving relief
									to a wide range of common problems that are often treated with tranquillisers or
									anti-depressants; there are in fact many others that are efficacious as anyone can
									find out for themselves. I simply strayed into this field today and made these comments
									as a result of making comparisons of attitudes obtaining in different medical and
									national cultures, and, as I wrote earlier, it is not my function to recommend or

									Just let me mention another of my own favourites before moving on. It is woodruff
									- <i>Asperula odorata </i>- and it is credited with having a wide range of qualities
									that are too numerous to describe in my present context. I will simply quote this:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"However, it is chiefly remarkable for its action upon the nerves: it calms, soothes,
										relaxes - exactly like the tranquillisers in which people indulge so freely today,
										but with the advantage that it causes no side-effects and is in no way toxic. Infusion
										of woodruff may therefore be given safely to all those who are troubled with disturbances
										of the sympathetic nervous system - including children and old persons - or who
										suffer from insomnia, vertigo, angor, neuralgia and excessive nervous tension."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									I usually have a quantity mixed in with my ordinary tea because it imparts a most
									delightful flavour.
								</p>
								<p>
									Returning to the "global" world and the necessity to consider our total interaction
									with it and all of its varied properties, there is one major component that just
									cannot be ignored. The earth's magnetic field protects the planet from the drastic
									effects of the "solar wind" - a huge and constant stream of electrically charged
									particles that are thrown out of the rotating ball of the sun in a manner resembling
									a Catherine wheel. Our magnetic field repels the particles and they flow past, being
									mainly observed in their transit at the poles where they create the northern and
									southern lights - the auroras. Planets such as Mars, where the magnetic field has
									declined, have been "scoured" and their atmosphere whisked away. However, it is
									not that aspect that I want to discuss, but the omnipresence of the field, and its
									importance in our continuing healthy life.</p>
								<p>
									It is an essential part of the environment in which we evolved, and we cannot live
									healthily without it. Inside a car, it vanishes completely - which might explain
									some of the bizarre behaviour of some drivers who spend many hours behind the wheel
									- while in nuclear submarines steps are taken to minimise the effects upon the crew
									of the long-term depletion that they would otherwise suffer as a result of the deprivation.
									Experiments upon the embryos of amphibians whose initial development resembles that
									of humans, reveal major deformities after short-term withdrawal of the normal terrestrial
									field.</p>
								<p>
									In a practical sense, a large lump of iron such as a central heating radiator will
									cancel out the local field for a distance on either side that depends upon the size
									of the radiator - typically, about 70 cms. If someone lies with their bed close
									to a wall <i>on the other side of which</i> a radiator is hung, they will experience
									total or partial screening, depending on whether they lie head to the wall, or parallel
									with it.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have experimented on myself in this type of situation, lying on the floor adjacent
									to a radiator. I don't lie there for very long, for the effects created are not
									pleasant, particularly those in my head when I place myself head to the metal. I
									have long thought of this as a possible contributor to cot death, and in the past
									I have written with these thoughts to representative organisations, with what success
									I do not know, for, apart from acknowledgments that I have received, there has never
									been any follow up from them.</p>
								<p>
									However, if someone sleeps in such a location in which they are wholly or partially
									deprived of the natural field, I am certain that they will not have good sleep,
									and that they could well develop problems. Disturbed sleep and a feeling of disorientation
									that persists into the day, create a happy hunting ground for spiritual intrusions
									intent upon causing mischief. As well as radiators, large chunks of building iron
									such as R.S.J.s [rolled-steel joists, I-beams] can act similarly in creating areas
									devoid of a magnetic field. Where the field is present in the fullness of its natural
									strength, all may still not be well. Left to itself it pulses regularly, and it
									is the pulsing at 10 cycles per second (hertz) that is so very important in the
									maintenance of mental and physical well-being.</p>
								<p>
									"Left to itself" being the operative words. A few moments thought will confirm that
									we live on a planet that, whether one believes it was created by God, or arrived
									courtesy of the Big Bang, is an exciting phenomenon. Rotating on its axis; orbiting
									the sun; performing a "dance" with the moon and other planets. Surviving collision
									with asteroids and other nasties; generating life; having this life suffer successive
									extinctions from trilobites down to dinosaurs and Neanderthals, and recovering and
									stabilising - until along comes man and Super Power Politics and rivalry, beginning
									a process of buggering up the whole lovely harmony. Many people have written and
									spoken about all the harm that has already been "achieved" in this process; I am
									here concerned with only one aspect, namely the damage that is being done to our
									health environment through interference with the natural magnetic field and its
									pulsing.</p>
								<p>
									Conjure up "HAARP" <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarp">
											[Wikipedia]</a></span> and also "USSR Woodpecker" <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Woodpecker">
											[Wikipedia]</a></span> from the Internet, and you will learn about high-powered
									electromagnetic transmissions that are or were created by the US and former Soviet
									Union. The Russian one is called Woodpecker, because that is what it sounds like
									on a radio receiver as it pulses at 10 hertz - OUR frequency. Ostensibly and originally
									designed to enable communication with nuclear submarines, no one outside the two
									Administrations really knows what is going on. HAARP stands for "Highly Active Auroral
									Research Project". It is located in Alaska and pumps enormous amounts of power into
									the atmosphere.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Web sites will provide much in the way of fact, speculation and conspiracy theories;
									my concern is with the effect upon mental health. Reports cited on the Web express
									concern that the transmissions are the cause of mental disturbance and depression
									in susceptible individuals, and it was these reports that came to mind when I read
									the papers describing the work done with 50,000 Swedish conscripts.
								</p>
								<p>
									You will recollect that the studies over a number of years had shown what was claimed
									were correlations between cannabis use and the onset of schizophrenia and depression.
									My contention is that it is most difficult to ascribe any one cause in the presence
									of many triggers. Sweden is very close to Russia, and, when measured over the North
									Pole, very close to Alaska also. It would be in the focus of much of the transmission
									aimed at nuclear submarines that patrol in Polar waters, whether Russian or US.
									Do these transmissions have a greater effect on people living in the Nordic countries?
									Who knows? One can only speculate.</p>
								<p>
									But "speculation" is the name of the game in much that surrounds mental health.
									American psychiatrist Thomas S. Szasz provides a great deal of fuel for speculation
									in his two books <i>The Manufacture of Madness</i> and <i>The Myth of Mental Illness</i>.
									The classification as a mental illness of "schizophrenia", however it is defined,
									is, according to Szasz, a social convenience that enables "authority" to be able
									to control a group of people who are, in the main, harmless, but who are socially
									deviant - he likens their treatment to that of witches in the past. When there is
									so much that is classed as mental or nervous illness that can only be contained
									or cured through the use of mind-altering drugs, one wonders how we actually managed
									to evolve for so many millions of years without them.</p>
								<p>
									I made another "rose-coloured spectacle" trip down memory lane with a friend of
									the same age as myself. Born and spending her early years in rural Essex, she, like
									me, confirms the absence in our youth of many of the ailments that beset so many
									people today. Asthmatic herself, because of a later identified wheat intolerance,
									she cannot recall other asthmatic children of her generation. She cannot recall
									either, as I cannot, children who were as disturbed as are those of today's generations.
								</p>
								<p>
									Like me she grew up without electricity, junk and fast food and aerosols; she drank
									water from wells, and wore natural fibre clothing and leather boots or shoes. There
									was no "instant" coffee, and very few of our acquaintance made "proper" coffee -
									in my friend's case, the drink offered to visitors to the house was usually homemade
									wine, which was apparently made in large quantities.</p>
								<p>
									I place emphasis upon the wearing of natural materials because there is much to
									indicate that man-made equivalents have had an adverse effect on health. We evolved
									naked, with our hands and feet in regular contact with the ground, and in an atmosphere
									that had a much higher concentration of negative ions than exists now. It is widely
									believed that the ion concentrations have an influence via the air that we actually
									breathe in, and also through contact with the acupuncture meridians and the points
									on them.</p>
								<p>
									If you have an ioniser it is very easy to demonstrate these effects, first by holding
									the device about 45 cms in front of the face and breathing in the ionised air -
									I find it very refreshing myself. Secondly, if the ioniser is held a short distance
									from an unclothed part of the body, it is possible to experience beneficial results.
									Reports described in Fred Soyka's book suggest that healing of wounds and of burns
									is speeded up if there is a good supply of negative ions.</p>
								<p>
									Man-made clothing can behave as an electrical insulator, and prevent the access
									of ions to the skin. It also creates electrical fields of its own, and can act to
									repel those ions that try to make contact. The materials that make up most modern
									footwear are also excellent electrical insulators - and isolate the wearer from
									any "earthing" contact with the ground - essential if one is to try to simulate
									the healthy conditions of evolution.</p>
								<p>
									Only today I had a demonstration of my own reaction to wearing wellingtons as I
									worked in a wet garden. I don't normally wear them because past experiences have
									demonstrated what I felt today - namely a profound ache that developed in my lower
									back, and a very noticeable drop in my energy level. Normal services were quickly
									restored when I kicked them off and went barefoot on a quarry-tiled floor. I recognise
									these effects as a consequence of my acute sensitivity to my electrical ambience:
									others who do not have this awareness are likely to persist and might even make
									themselves ill over a period of time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Leather soled shoes and boots - not readily available today - allowed closer connection,
									and in my belief were much healthier. Modern youth probably grows up with the very
									minimal contact with the ground or with any regular connection with earthed surfaces.
									Most modern furnishings, bedding and carpets are synthetic and create their own
									static electricity and electrical fields, and create dusts that equally have peculiar
									electrical properties.
								</p>
								<p>
									Living in an unnatural electrical environment, surrounded by a variety of devices
									that produce their own electromagnetic fields, sleeping in a room that most probably
									has a TV and computer and who knows what else electrical, is it any wonder that
									modern youngsters leave the womb clutching in one hand an inhaler ready for the
									asthma that will inevitably be their fate, and in the other a prescription for Prozac
									or Librium? - and that is before they embark on a life with cola drinks, adulterated
									chicken pieces, E-numbers and Aspartame. What happens to their vulnerable minds,
									I'll leave to your own imagination.</p>

								<p>
									Returning to the possible effects of clothing upon the access of the desirable negative
									ions to the body, I think that it would be useful to speculate on the effect of
									wearing a bra, particularly one made from synthetic materials, and particularly
									upon the development of breast cancer. Going back down memory lane, I believe that
									the first encounter that girls of my generation had with bras was when they joined
									one of the armed forces, where they were standard issue (together with passion-killing
									"blackout" bloomers, according to my WREN friends!). These were essentially always
									made of cotton. Breasts are obviously tender and vulnerable parts of the female
									body, and I think that it is fair to speculate that their electrical isolation inside
									the insulating fabric of a modern bra may be a contributory factor in the creation
									of breast tumours.</p>
								<p>
									I can only speak for myself (not about wearing a bra, although if I continue to
									put on weight, one may become necessary!). I avoid absolutely manmade fibres in
									my clothing and bedding, having on many occasions in the past been made to realise
									that their use brings discomfort and "agitation". One always faces this problem
									when trying to describe bodily sensations in terms that others can identify and
									relate to in themselves. As with all forms of "pollution", it is difficult to know
									what is the threshold between discomfort and actual harm.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many people grow up in an environment that surrounds them with numerous sources
									of pollution, and never have the opportunity of knowing what unpolluted life is
									like. As an aside - from about 1970 I gave up television, and didn't own one for
									about twenty years. When then I acquired one and recommenced regular viewing, I
									felt that I had arrived at another planet. While the technology had developed in
									many ways, the standards of acceptability had plummeted to depths hitherto undreamed
									of.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is outside my remit to comment on much that I see as the degradation and humiliation
									of individuals, and yet the whole ambience is akin to that in which the obscene
									spiritual intrusions thrive. A casual moment channel hopping the other day saw a
									brief glimpse of the V. Graham Norton "show", and the sight of a man being publicly
									confronted with his "wank sock", which his future bride had given to the show! I
									didn't stay to see what tasks he had to accomplish to recover it - Norton had even
									opened the sock to reveal what purported to be the residue from masturbation. That
									to me is just one instance of what I regard as the "pollution" of people's lives
									and living environment and which can result in the creation of a hedonism that makes
									the entry of malevolent intrusion into the minds of the vulnerable all the easier.
								</p>
								<p>
									One form of pollution that affects most urban areas is that created by all of the
									light sources flooding the sky and blotting out the stars. I find it sad to think
									of the deprivation of youngsters who grow up having never seen the stars in an "unpolluted"
									sky. About the only pleasure derived from wartime blackout was the vision of the
									undiminished brilliance of the stars overhead. When I view the human dross that
									passes for "stars" in the modern media/pop culture, I find it equally sad that today's
									youngsters have no outstanding living stars to inspire them.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Pole Star in the northern sky, or the Southern Cross in its own hemisphere have
									been fixed and constant and have guided and comforted mariners throughout recorded
									time. Where, I wonder, are the points of reference, sources of inspiration for the
									youngsters of today? In many ways the young are sold short, deprived of their childhood
									and "innocence" by a culture that sees them in no other light than as consumers
									and creators of wealth - for others, the exploiters.</p>
								<p>
									Bombarded into accepting that certain soft drinks and fast foods are manna from
									heaven, driven by what is "cool", they are encouraged from all sides and quarters
									to believe that the only purpose in living is to have the latest play-station -
									and to have sex. Young girls now are encouraged to wear clothes with pretend breasts
									- because it is "sexy" - when they have hardly left the cradle. Peer pressure, and
									pressure from all of the elements that want to exploit them encourage sex at the
									earliest possible age.
								</p>
								<p>
									What has evolved as a fundamental method of procreating and enhancing the species,
									with functions and reactions that reach into every cell of the body, has sunk to
									what - descriptive words fail me - in popular esteem? Hardly any TV programme, other
									than the dedicated documentary, can run without its embedded episodes of bonking,
									shagging, or fucking - to think that it used to be called "making <i>love</i>"!</p>
								<p>
									Spring is at its peak as I write, and I have been watching the birds and the bees.
									Each year I marvel that the little birds can be conned yet again. I watch them in
									the garden and hedgerows frantically trying to find mates, singing their little
									heads off and posturing and fluttering - and then they copulate - just once. That
									one act of togetherness immediately throws a switch - and suddenly it's frenetic
									nest building, egg sitting, and frenzied food carrying to the fledglings, then nurturing
									and protection until flight becomes possible and the young fly the nest. Then the
									idiots do it all over again for a second brood - one moment of bliss leading to
									frantic, compulsive activity.</p>
								<p>
									All of those imperatives reside in all creatures, and stifling the consequences
									of the initial action can produce many results that are destructive. A young teenage
									girl, possibly pressurised into her first sexual encounter, is immediately subjected
									to all of the responses exhibited by the female bird - even if it was just a casual
									fumbling shag from an equally inexperienced lad.
								</p>
								<p>
									To list all of the inner responses that will be triggered within her is beyond my
									scope, but what I am leading to is the consequence of a natural process that has
									been frustrated. The disturbing unfulfilled responses may lead to a feeling of revulsion
									with herself and her body, and have been known to provoke the reactions of self-harm
									and eating disorders from an urge to "punish" the vehicle of her inner disgust.
									A situation such as this is so easily exploited by the malevolent intrusion - an
									unhappy girl, not truly understanding the source of her unhappiness, seeking isolation
									- a mind possibly wide open to intrusion and increased depression - encouraged into
									further isolation and suicide?</p>
								<p>
									And what of the children, the offspring of such casual and promiscuous encounters?
									Children whose father might be any one of a pick and mix collection. Another coffee
									break switch on and I found myself in the Trisha experience on ITV. There for the
									morning's entertainment were young women who had become mothers and who weren't
									sure which of several men might have been the father, and the programme had done
									DNA comparisons that were revealed in the full panoply of the prurient build up
									of the show and its eagerly gawping faces in the audience.
								</p>
								<p>
									No thought is given to the children, not just these children but also the many who
									are the product of these collective copulations. Is there any wonder that there
									is so much domestic violence when possibly the putative father in a marriage or
									relationship finds out that he is not in fact the actual father, and has been deceived
									and conned? More importantly the children as they grow and realise the casualness
									of their creation might feel little worth in themselves, and, possibly feeling sullied,
									resort to self-harm and the isolation that again opens the door to malevolent intrusions
									and their taunts that can lead to suicide.</p>
								<p>
									These are topics of such wide scope that I can do little more than mention them,
									but it is a realm of human experience where spiritual intrusions wreak immense amounts
									of harm in the minds and lives of the vulnerable. Any enlargement would include
									the ways in which cravings can be stimulated and addictions fostered and driven,
									but that is for another time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Meanwhile, returning to my main theme, it may seem that I am labouring the problems
									created by the variety of electrical phenomena. I am in fact underplaying them,
									and only limit my writing in deference to those who have problems with science and
									technology, and find difficulty in relating any of this to mental health, and particularly
									to voice hearing and all of the rest that I have written about. Be assured that
									I include everything as a component of the totality of human experience and daily
									life.
								</p>
								<p>
									I reiterate my point that <i>anything</i> that undermines and depletes the normal
									function and well-being of our bodies and minds plays into the "hands" of the sources
									of spiritual intrusion. I am tempted to write at length about the influence of diet,
									food intolerance and allergy upon mental health, but realise that it is an immense
									subject that is frequently written about in many books and articles. The problem
									is that there are many conflicting opinions, and it is difficult for the average
									person to arrive at a balanced judgment.</p>
								<p>
									It is claimed that there is a "Balanced British Diet", and that it provides all
									of the nutrients that a person needs. I heartily disagree, and, to give one example
									from the Food Standards Agency's latest pronouncement, at 40 mgms, the recommended
									level of vitamin C intake is just about that which will prevent scurvy. They spoke
									about the possibility of stomach upsets and diarrhoea being caused by high intake
									- apparently not recognising the availability of slow release products that "trickle"
									the vitamin out over several hours. I regularly take 1 gm per day, and experience
									no problems - in fact, if I don't take as much I often get problems in my gums.
									When one considers that our simian immediate antecedents were largely herbivores
									and fruit eaters, is it not obvious that we through our evolution require vitamin
									C in significant quantities - as well as the magnesium that would have come from
									the plant chlorophyll?
								</p>
								<p>
									How I wish that the medical establishment would put its own house in order and control
									the use of many of the harmful substances that pass for medication or are used in
									food additives - especially those - and let individuals such as me kill ourselves
									with mineral and vitamin supplements if that is our wish - although most people
									who take supplements are too well informed now to do anything so drastic. (Currently
									as I write certain doctors are trying to develop a campaign to have taxes levied
									on "fatty foods" i.e. the junk foods that are making so many young people so obese.
									Part of the campaign propaganda declares that the British diet today is too heavily
									loaded with unsuitable and junk foods lacking in nutritional value, but promoting
									obesity. Whatever happened to the "Balanced British Diet"?)</p>
								<p>
									Over the years I have obtained much personal benefit from taking charge of my own
									diet and intake of supplements - much of the benefit coming from what I <i>don't</i>
									ingest, as much as from what I do. To be brief, I have latterly followed a diet
									based upon my blood group, and find benefit from the elimination of a number of
									items, resulting in greater mobility of my upper body and shoulders - a very important
									consideration in a driver who is well past seventy, and who needs to be able to
									turn his body freely to be safe at road junctions. Likewise I have had food intolerance
									tests, and again have experienced benefit from the elimination of certain items
									- including my much-liked dark chocolate!</p>
								<p>
									A recital of all that I have done would not, I feel, be helpful, and anyway is specific
									to myself. Guidance has come from <i>Nutritional Medicine</i> by Drs. Stephen Davies
									and Alan Stewart whose aim is to try to treat a wide variety of ailments and diseases,
									including mental problems, by nutritional means: this one of my "bibles". (One has
									only to look in it at the role of the B vitamins to realise their importance in
									maintaining mental health, while something as simple as magnesium can, in depletion,
									result in apathy, confusion and disorientation, depression, learning disability
									and memory impairment, vertigo, convulsions and epilepsy, insomnia, hyperactivity.
									Because of past glaciations, magnesium is almost absent in northern soils, in the
									local water, and in food that is produced there.)
								</p>
								<p>
									Mental health and nutrition are the prime concerns of an interesting book jointly
									written by Dr. Carl Pfeiffer and Patrick Holford. From one end you enter the Pfeiffer
									contribution - <i>Mental Illness - the nutrition connection</i>, and from the other,
									the Holford contribution - <i>Mental Health - the nutrition connection</i>. But
									by far the greatest revelation concerning diet and mental health, and "alien" substances
									and mental health came to me from Dr. Richard Mackarness' two books <i>Not All in the
										Mind</i> and <i>Chemical Victims</i>, which may still be found second hand if
									one is prepared to look.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some may say that they are dated, but even so, they provide an excellent starting
									point from which to dig further into the whole topic of diet and mental health,
									and I am certain that there must be many recent books and articles that provide
									sound advice. However, be cautious, for, as with many emotive subjects such as cancer
									and mental health, there are many therapies and diets that flourish in the media
									and in the chat shows, and then drop from view, leaving no trace other than in the
									additions to the books abandoned on the shelves. As with everything else that I
									have written about - discernment, discernment, discernment!

								<p>
									Reviewing the most recent parts of my writing, I may appear to be drifting away
									from the main purpose of the whole book - that of describing the intrusion of spiritual
									malevolence and the creation of dominance and mental distress. If I have done do,
									it has been purely unintentional and has only occurred because I have tried to develop
									the theme that intruding entities take intelligent advantage of <i>any</i> circumstances
									that result in the physical and mental depletion of individuals, and of the resulting
									feelings of insecurity that these can create. I must in this last descriptive and
									speculative chapter take steps to return to the declared purpose, although, like
									much of my attack, my thrust may at times seem oblique.
								</p>
								<p>
									Hark back, if you will, to where I wrote of the occasion when I had climbed to a
									nearby plateau on the fell side and where I had gone to look for signs of ancient
									trackways. In the beautiful stillness and evening light I sat taking in the scene,
									and watched a fox as it crossed in front of me some short distance away. Suddenly,
									and with no apparent preliminary check, it dashed for safety, its whole demeanour
									and behaviour having changed within a milli-microsecond. And it dashed <i>away</i>
									from me - which may seem to be doubly stating the obvious. But why?
								</p>
								<p>
									I had made no sound, hadn't moved and was not obviously visible. All that had triggered
									the fox's reaction had been my scent that had drifted down on a light breeze. So
									only its nose figured in this early warning system, and it was highly directional.
									But so is all of the mammalian early warning system. The eyes, the ears and the
									nose have their primary personal defence role, and in that role connect directly
									to the centre of instinctive locomotion - the "solar plexus" - bypassing the brain.</p>
								<p>
									My description is probably too simplistic for some, but nevertheless serves to make
									my argument. The left eye, ear and nostril send signals to the right half of the
									brain, and the reverse for the right hand sensors. Normally when "free ranging",
									the animal is sensing globally - i.e. the eyes are intent on peripheral vision and
									each eye covers a wide arc on its own side; each ear likewise has its sweep of coverage
									- "sweep" being the operative word, for the ears are very mobile, and one has only
									to look at racehorses as they move down to the start of a race to see the two ears
									independently "semaphoring" as they respond to sounds that are arriving from all
									directions. Not so obvious, particularly to humans, is the directional capability
									of the nose, yet it must be there for the fox to have acted as it did.</p>
								<p>
									If anything potentially dangerous is sensed, several changes take place instantly
									and instinctively - there can be no place in the equation for logical thought and
									deduction. If the threat is to the left, the left eye adopts focussed vision, while
									the right is de-focussed and turned slightly to prevent so-called "macular" vision.
									The left ear goes into directional hearing and lifts and "cocks" towards the source
									of the sound, while the right ear is "de-tuned", in that an inner muscular contraction
									takes place that mutes the sound, and concentrates the hearing into the left ear.
									The left nostril flares and goes into "sniffing" mode, while inside the right nasal
									passage a minor contraction occurs that diminishes the airflow and scenting capability.
								</p>
								<p>
									The early warning system has detected danger to the left, and the limbs are provoked
									into action to take the creature away to the right. There is no pause for consultation;
									the instinctive body is already primed with instructions from its evolution - threat
									from the left, limbs gather to strike off to the right.
								</p>
								<p>
									As I have written several times, we, you and I, are mammals. I know that you don't
									really need to be told that, but it must be emphasised. But what has to be emphasised
									further is that all - all - of the early warning systems continue to exist in us
									and our organs and limbs, and that all of the same instinctive instant responses
									are created within us. We humans differ in that the different sides of our brains
									have certain dedicated functions dictated by our intellectual development.</p>
								<p>
									In writing this I do so as someone who spends much time in imaginative, ruminative,
									speculative, introspective and, at times, mildly apprehensive thought. All of the
									time that I am writing or planning what I am going to write, I am indulging in mental
									"verbalisation". In other words, I am engaging in what is now commonly and simplistically
									called "right brain" activity. Also I am right-handed, and so can only write from
									the standpoint of someone who has this particular combination.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is only in minor ways that I can observe and comment on other mind and body combinations.
									However, I am writing as carefully as I can, and with as much detail as possible,
									because as well as the mind of the "thinker", what I am describing might be the
									inner mental state of someone who is locked into the internal voices, someone who
									is constantly listening and adding these instinctive responses to those that are
									happening within as the inner "presence" provokes, cajoles, threatens, agitates
									or holds the "listener" enthralled.</p>
								<p>
									Constantly, I am creating in my right brain images and "sounds" (i.e. my verbalisation)
									that, to my <i>animal</i> brain, appear to be arriving from the <i>left</i> side,
									via my left eye and ear - and the instinctive "me" kicks in and primes my body for
									a particular action. Except that it doesn't "kick in" - the instinctive responses
									are there all of the time as I persist, and have persisted for most of my life,
									in this mode of thinking.
								</p>
								<p>
									The responses within the wild creature are transient as either it responds and takes
									evasive action, or decides that the threat is not real and relaxes. For the thinking
									human, the pattern of thought goes on and on and on. Through all waking time, the
									process persists, and the body becomes polarised, as it is constantly primed for
									a response and a resultant action - that never happen.</p>
								<p>
									The animal me is receiving signals ostensibly from my left, and wants to take action
									that propels me to my right. The quadruped me "coils" ready to jump off, and engages
									my limbs diagonally - left upper half and right lower half work together (left diagonal),
									and vice versa. One diagonal is poised to spring and the other locked to give the
									balance. <i>All</i> of the muscles of locomotion are engaged, and the whole process
									will produce results that I am sure most of you will begin to recognise within your
									own bodies, although the roughly twenty percent of you whose thinking is essentially
									and predominantly verbal, will probably recognise them in the <i>right</i> diagonal.</p>
								<p>
									Remaining with the left diagonal, the reaction within the musculature of the left
									upper has the effect of lifting the shoulder, taking it even higher than the lift
									created by the curve of the body, the "Vincent curve", and reinforcing the "kink"
									at the base of the neck. Pressure applied between the upper inner corner of the
									scapula and the spine will, in most individuals, reveal a very tender area. Associated
									acupuncture points in this location that may be influenced, (Bl 37, 38), are used
									to treat: "lungs empty"; weary and paralysed; weak; emaciated; madness; loss of
									memory.</p>
								<p>
									Tension created within the shoulder joint itself that is continuous can contribute
									to such conditions as a "frozen shoulder", particularly when added mental or emotional
									stress has compounded those stresses that have become a permanent feature. The biceps
									of the left arm are in a state of permanent contraction, and eventually produce
									a point of soreness in the centre of the muscle approximately 2 cm below the level
									of the deltoid vee. This is the location of two points on the acupuncture "Lung"
									meridian, L 3, &amp; 4. Again allowing for the seemingly "quaint" direct translation
									from the Chinese, these points may be used to treat: cerebral congestion; speaks
									to himself or doesn't speak at all; "possessed by a devil"; confused; forgetful;
									vertigo; depressed.</p>
								<p>
									It is possible to go down the arm and at every joint and point of tension locate
									acupuncture points that may be used to treat a variety of serious "mind" conditions.
									There is no reason for me to catalogue them all in what is meant to be an overview,
									and so I'll skirt them and conclude the arm repertoire with the eighth point on
									the "Heart" meridian. This is on the palm of the hand immediately proximal to the
									space between the ring and little fingers, and in the "crease" where the painful
									and disabling condition known as "contraction of the palmar aponeurosis" occurs.
									This acupuncture point, H 8, has a large repertory that divides into two parts,
									the first being the "nervous" group: " "disease and feelings of calamity in the
									heart and chest"; palpitations; hysteria; fear; "frightened of people"; trembling".
									The second group centres on the urinary, genital functions, and takes the discussion
									logically into the other part of the diagonal - the lower right, in my case.</p>
								<p>
									"Difficulty in urination; urinary incontinence; one side of scrotum larger than
									the other; impotent; general uterine disease; pruritis vulvae; prolapse of the uterus"
									- these are all conditions that are capable of being treated from H 8, and analysis
									will show that they may be caused by the permanent "coiling" of all of the musculature
									of locomotion of the right lower half of the body - from the bottom of the ribs
									down to the toes. Study a horse in motion and observe the full scope of the action,
									and translate it into yourself.</p>
								<p>
									Experiments on myself reveal that persistent and aggravated tension consistent with
									prolonged apprehension or intense concentration will cause sharp pain in the very
									region where the presence of pain is used to diagnose appendicitis, and the presence
									of pain from this particular mind-induced source is the most probable reason why
									over fifty percent of appendixes removed turn out to have been healthy. The preparation
									for movement of the buttock and thigh and the prolonged contraction of their muscles
									lead to a wide range of other problems that self experiment will reveal for you.
								</p>
								<p>
									Just two will suffice - the hip joint above all others is firmly involved in locomotion,
									and persistent tension there may affect the point on the Gall meridian, G 30, at
									which location one could treat: "half of body uncoordinated"; paralysis; epilepsy;
									nervous exhaustion. The gathering tension of tendons immediately above the ankle
									creates a zone where, over time, a feeling akin to paralysis can be produced, in
									a region where there are several places where serious mental conditions are capable
									of being treated.</p>
								<p>
									In an account of the work of Sigmund Freud, he is credited with observations concerning
									the early onset of multiple sclerosis. He records double vision, paralysis above
									the left eye, and paralysis of the right ankle. The difficulties with the eyes may
									be explained by the fact that the left eye is straining to look to the left, where
									the imagined visual images are perceived, while the right eye has to concentrate
									upon the task of practical vision - its role that eventually makes it the dominant
									eye.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have noted earlier how it is possible when driving, suddenly to say to oneself
									"How did I get here?" One has been driving on automatic pilot, locked in one's thoughts,
									"viewing" the mental images with the "circuitry" of the left eye, while the driving
									has been conducted by means of automatic responses to what is seen with the right
									eye.</p>
								<p>
									When this "split viewing" is persistent, or carried to extremes, then the conflict
									between the musculature of the left eye and that of the right can lead to serious
									problems. The right eye difficulties are accommodated by turning the head slightly
									to the left, bringing the right eye forward. Watching people on TV when they are
									following an autocue reveals the fact that many are obviously reading with the dominant
									eye, and with the head slightly turned.
								</p>
								<p>
									When a person is absorbed in internal listening or deeply engrossed and lost in
									imagination, and when this state lasts for long periods, the struggle between the
									two eyes may result in severe stresses of the musculature, not only of the left
									eye, but of the whole left face and scalp as far around as the back of the neck.
									And not only that associated with the eye and its struggle to turn, but also the
									ear, which is also trying to focus to the left. As well as the numbness and paralysis
									that develop around and above the left eye, there is the possibility of causing
									left side migraine, and in extreme cases, dyslexia.</p>
								<p>
									I was once acquainted with a family in which the mother and three daughters all
									suffered severely from migraine, while two of the three boys were dyslexic. The
									mother was very imaginative in a constructive way, but also could be most apprehensive.
									Her sister was permanently locked into the inner space of the voices in her mind,
									and hardly engaged with the real world. I believe that the children were "foetaly
									programmed" with the potentially divided vision that stemmed from the mother being
									deeply absorbed in her world of imagination/<wbr />apprehension - which, if it was a family trait, may have resulted in her sister having become lost in her inner world that had then been taken over by the intruding voices.
								</p>
								<p>
									The dyslexia of Jane whom I have mentioned must have had a similar cause. She was
									very much a victim of her profound imagination combined with the stresses to which
									she was subjected. Her eyes were obviously working to two different agendas, but
									then came back together when gradually her fears were calmed, and her life became
									secure.</p>
								<p>
									Freud was convinced that the MS-associated symptoms of two women whom he had studied
									had also included nymphomania. Most odd, until one finds that an acupuncture point
									at the base of the skull, and which would be severely stressed by the mechanisms
									that I am describing, may be used to treat nymphomania! Whether the perpetual aggravation
									and stimulation of the acupuncture point resulted in interesting stimulation elsewhere
									is a question to which I have not yet found an answer, even through practical experimentation.

									I had made up my mind that I would make no further reference to the effect of natural
									phenomena on people, whether as individuals or in the mass, but it is rapidly becoming
									impossible to ignore as the whole world seems to be running on a very short fuse.
									Events that I associate with the fast approaching perihelial opposition of Mars
									are happening right on cue. Already there have been several earthquakes, we have
									had our war, and we have our pestilence in the shape of the SARS virus. Everywhere
									there are major confrontations, whether between nations; by groups demanding change;
									within businesses and employees organisations - and between individuals or within
									families and similar groups, as almost daily tragedies are revealed in the media.
								</p>
								<p>
									I will not repeat all that I wrote before, but as my sleep becomes more fragmented,
									just as it did in the equivalent period in 1988-9, so I am aware now, as I wasn't
									then, of the rapidly increasing number of spontaneous comments coming from a variety
									of people of all ages. The actual event peaks on August 28th, and I fully expect
									there to be more earthquakes as well as some volcanic eruptions during the next
									few months, although it is the effect upon the behaviour of individuals and groups
									that is most germane in the context of my book. July 2018 is when the next event
									occurs, so get it marked in your diaries well in advance!
								</p>
								<p>
									In observing the wide range of reactions - or, in fact, nonreaction - of individuals
									to natural events, or to the imperatives of their evolution, I am as much interested
									in the lack of response as I am in the instances where it occurs. Where there is
									no apparent reaction, or very little, I speculate that there already exists such
									a base-load of entrenched stress that any increase is barely noticeable.
								</p>
								<p>
									Additionally, reactions and responses may be put down to other triggers that exist
									in the person's life. I suspect that very few individuals know just what a range
									of automatic reactions exist in our inheritance, or what is involved in the "autonomic
									nervous system", other than a vague recollection of "flight, fight, adrenalin".
									(<i>Mind as Healer, Mind as Slayer</i> by Kenneth R. Pelletier is a useful and readable
									sourcebook).</p>
								<p>
									Even if treated simplistically, as I intend to do, there is much more than "flight,
									fight and adrenalin" involved in the mind/body, body/mind interactions that are
									features of our lives. There are many situations that one encounters where flight
									and fight are not practical, nor do they fulfil the needs of the moment. Domination,
									whether by one partner over another, parent over child, employer over employee places
									the dominated one at the receiving end of the anticipated violence, whether physical
									or verbal, and from which escape is not an option. "Anticipation" is the operative
									word, for such can hold a person within a perpetual state of stress that in the
									world of animal interplay is purely transient as domination and subservience are
									sorted out.</p>
								<p>
									The mammal that is apprehensive undergoes a number of automatic and instinctive
									reactions. It waits poised while the degree of threat is assessed. Breathing is
									suppressed, ears are cocked, anal and bladder sphincters are locked (although some
									creatures immediately void their bladders and bowels), the tail is pressed down
									and genitals are tightened. Additionally, a lock is put on the oesophagus, and at
									the base of the throat, and the body is primed for such reaction as may become necessary.
									Variants of these reactions occur if the perceived threat comes from within the
									social group, when events are dictated by established pecking orders.</p>
								<p>
									The perpetual state of apprehensive listening is one that I have tried to describe
									in those sections of my book that have been more specific about the behaviour of
									intruding entities. And perpetual become the responses within the body, responses
									that add to the diagonal tensions that I have already written about.</p>
								<p>
									Although I have condemned the universal and perpetual obsession with sex in virtually
									every strand of modern Western human activity, paradoxically it is the only reason
									from our evolution that justifies our existence. The purpose of each generation
									is to prolong and improve the species - thus the only real function for the male
									is to protect and inject the sperm, while the female has to allow access to her
									eggs and womb only to a chosen male, and to repulse others of lesser stature. Consequently,
									many of the instinctive responses are governed purely by those two imperatives.</p>
								<p>
									Males have to protect their testicles, and, in animals in their natural environment,
									this is done by retracting them as much as possible. The whole process in human
									males is confused by all of the conflicting signals that are being generated by
									the mind in response to the many real and imagined threats to which they are exposed
									in daily life, and which they create for themselves through their persistent thought
									patterns.
								</p>
								<p>
									It has long been observed that men have one testicle, usually the right one, higher
									than the other. Only a small percentage, it is said, have the left one higher. Many
									explanations are offered to account for this phenomenon, the most recent that I
									have heard being that with the upright stance, the asymmetry became necessary to
									allow both testicles to fit into a restricted space. Each autumn I used to corral
									in one of my fields up to twenty rams belonging to a neighbour, where they were
									held until the appropriate breeding time arrived.
								</p>
								<p>
									As I gardened or worked in my workshop I had plenty of opportunity to observe them,
									and it is impossible to ignore the testicles. In every case, the testicles were
									level, as is the situation with other male animals that I have noted. During the
									comparatively short evolutionary time in which humans have stood upright, there
									has not been long enough for the lopsided testicle to have developed - so why did
									it?</p>
								<p>
									There are two influences at work: the first is the instinctive uplift resulting
									from the very act of thinking. A human thinking is the same as a wild creature listening
									and wondering. The response is to lift the testicles, until, as listening/thinking
									is a permanent function, the testicles are always partially withdrawn. The second
									influence comes as a result of the body being primed diagonally as I have described
									earlier. The priming tenses the right buttock and adjoining musculature, including
									the suspensory muscles of the testicles, further drawing up the right one, until
									the scrotum appears lopsided. (Recollect, the acupuncture point H 8, with its repertory
									for treating conditions that could be construed as "nervous", "emotional", was also
									indicated if one side of the scrotum was higher than the other - a certain confirmation
									that the asymmetry is not natural).
								</p>
								<p>
									There is an account in one version of <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> of young
									men of the time practicing diligently to be able to retract their testicles sufficiently
									to pass themselves off as eunuchs, and enter the baths on days reserved for women.
									Conversely, I have proved to my own satisfaction that it is possible to relax sufficiently
									to be able to <i>lower</i> the higher testicle, and eventually both.</p>
								<p>
									I have knowingly encountered only one man with a left high testicle, and that was
									in the Navy, where living conditions were such that very little was hidden. This
									man was very "left brain", in that he was provocatively verbal, and was a verbal
									confrontation waiting to happen. If my analysis is correct, he was polarised on
									the opposite diagonal to the majority.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another who came into the same category of being ready to fizz verbally with little
									provocation was someone that I once knew who developed <i>right</i> breast cancer.
									Again, the polarisation, this time on the right diagonal, I believe, resulted in
									permanent contraction of the muscles across the chest, with a consequent diminution
									of the flow of blood and lymph in the breast itself. This woman was told by her
									surgeon that she was one of about 20% of women who develop right breast cancer.</p>
								<p>
									Another observation relating to breasts that I have made is that, of friends who
									have newly given birth, and who develop mastitis, everyone has been in the <i>left</i>
									breast; again, I believe, giving credence to my analysis of the effects of prolonged
									mental activity of a particular type - and not necessarily <i>stressful</i> mental
									activity - and of the diagonal polarisation of the body and its musculature.</p>
								<p>
									As a corollary, I have noticed effects in myself that confirm the left breast stress
									- not, in my case, mastitis, although I believe that it is not unknown in men, but
									my left nipple is larger than the right, and frequently itches - to such an extent
									that many of my shirts have a hole just there.
								</p>
								<p>
									The whole question of the polarisation of the body, brain and senses in relation
									to the two diagonals is one that deserves detailed research. I am certain that answers
									will be found to problems such as impotence and female frigidity, both of which
									may result from the fact that the two sides of the genitals are responding to two
									different types of stimulus - possibly to the extent that only one side is sensitive,
									while the other is less so.</p>
								<p>
									The lateral contrast in sensitivity explains why, when I peel an onion, only my
									left eye and nostril react. Likewise, if I get a sore throat, only the left side
									feels the irritation. (I have heard other individuals make similar comments). This
									is the result of the action of perpetually trying to "sniff" to the left, and "closing
									down" my right nostril.
								</p>
								<p>
									It probably explains why I chewed only on the left side of my mouth, for, along
									with my sense of smell being confined to the left nostril, that was the side where
									taste was also most acute. Over latter years I have cultivated chewing on both sides,
									and also chewing in a more blatant, "animal-like" manner, moving the food around,
									quidding it and reducing it to a fluid before swallowing - living alone I have no
									resulting "social" problems! The effect has been to improve my digestion and general
									sense of relaxation as the body responds to natural behaviour.
								</p>
								<p>
									A consequence of not sensing any irritation down the right inside of the throat
									might be that phlegm and debris that would normally be sensed and coughed up would
									simply be undetected and descend unchecked into the right lung, with a consequent
									build-up and potential disease.
								</p>
								<p>
									I could go on, for, as with much that I am trying to describe, I have been observing
									and experimenting for over twenty years. If I did so, however, it is unlikely that
									I would add significantly to my case, and could easily lead to confusion or distraction.
									I'll simply add that much can be done to balance the two diagonals with proper attention
									to breathing, particularly by concentration on maintaining a balance between the
									two nostrils, where, in my case, there is often a serious imbalance. As I correct
									the differential it is possible to feel beneficial internal reactions as a degree
									of harmony is restored.

									In almost twenty-five years I have learned or devised many ways of coping with intruding
									voices, ways that I hope will have become evident from all that I have written and
									recorded. My strategies are successful in that I am no longer troubled by any of
									the presences that intrude.
								</p>
								<p>
									Voice hearers who are deeply embroiled in the conflicts within the mind are most
									unlikely to have the resources to cope with, let alone devise a strategy, and are
									most likely to succeed in reclaiming their minds with the sympathetic and understanding
									help of others. The help must be in the form of an "enabling", "opening up" support.
									<i>Never</i> begin a sentence with "Why don't you...?" If the person was capable
									of doing the "why don't you" bit, is it not most likely that they would already
									have made the attempt?
								</p>
								<p>
									Surprising though it may seem, you may find some clues in the way that the large
									primates have been studied. There is a process known as "habituation" through which
									the presence of the observer is gradually introduced without provocation and without
									imposing any stress upon the gorillas. Your relaxed presence has always to be there
									in an undemanding way, ready and able to say - "Let's ..." There has always got
									to be an easy avenue to follow towards something desirable, and an easy path down
									which to retreat to the safety of known habits.</p>
								<p>
									How you proceed will depend obviously upon the individuality of you both - the individuality
									that I have insisted on through all that I have described and analysed. Only you
									can see the problems, set the possible goals. It is difficult, but you must try
									to efface yourself and let the other flourish.</p>
								<p>
									There are many practical steps that can be taken. Most are obvious, and almost suggest
									themselves, such as an adequate and wholesome diet, free from junk and additives.
									Hair analysis to detect any shortfall in minerals - many now have their hair analysed
									when planning pregnancy, and the "Foresight" organisation provides a reliable service
									that is available to others as well as the potential parents, while there are other
									laboratories to be found on the Internet.
								</p>
								<p>
									When one considers that only microgrammes of iodine are necessary to prevent cretinism
									in iodine depleted regions, and that the intake provided by iodised salt will ensure
									a healthy physical and mental life for a child, is it not obvious that there must
									be an exquisite balance among other minerals that may be absent or present in excess?
								</p>
								<p>
									One can learn much from the way in which farm animals are looked after. To take
									one example, barley which is grown on the farm for animal feed is preserved using
									proprionic acid (Propcorn). This protects against moulds, but has the effect of
									killing the germ of the seed and depleting the vitamin E content. Calves fed this
									grain develop a deficiency condition called white muscle disease, and are fed supplements
									of vitamin E, but are also fed selenium which is necessary to promote the absorption
									of vit. E. Would that the same care was used to ensure the proper physical and mental
									development of <i>human children</i> in the face of all of the unnatural substances
									that they ingest as food. Equally fundamental is food intolerance analysis, as the
									work of such specialists as Richard Mackarness demonstrates.
								</p>
								<p>
									One simple and practical step that I took for myself was to wear around my neck
									the sort of watch that joggers once used. I set the timer to ring on every hour,
									when I took stock of everything - posture, breathing, what was going on in my mind
									- then with a brief prayer, I re-established my links with reality and continued
									with whatever I was meant to be doing. Numbers of individuals find the loneliness
									of 3 a.m. intolerable as they are then at their most vulnerable. With some friends
									I used to make "pillow crosses"*. These were crosses made of a semi-rigid material,
									about 12 - 15 cms long that could be kept under the pillow. Held in the hand during
									these times of personal despair, they formed a tangible link with a universal source
									of comfort and hope.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p class="note">
										* Our simplest and best liked were made from wooden beads 15 - 20 mm in diameter
										threaded on leather thong or bootlace: they were comforting to hold, and presented

									Many who suffer from diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis,
									and who have mercury amalgam in their fillings, are having these removed and replaced
									with material that is neutral. The same considerations may apply to individuals
									with long standing intractable problems in the "mind".
								</p>
								<p>
									Anyone planning such removal must use the services of a dentist who really believes
									in this strategy, for the fillings have to be removed in a pre-planned sequence
									over a considerable time as the whole body readjusts to the changes, and it must
									be done using secure protection against ingestion of the debris. The amalgam fillings
									that have been in place for some time will have created electrical battery effects
									between the respective fillings, and between the fillings and other metal that may
									be in the mouth. Someone whom I know who is having her fillings removed properly
									has the added problem that at the core of her crowned incisors she has a different
									metal - largely nickel - to which she has been shown to be allergic, and which compounds
									her overall difficulties and is making the sequential removal a long term process.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have indicated how the body can become the source of unpredictable ailments as
									it responds to the inner-looking, inner-listening mind. A long term voice hearer
									may have lost connection with the true physical self, and may need a great deal
									of help to find it again. There are so many ways in which the body can be rehabilitated
									and made to feel a good place to live in, rather than a shell in which to have a
									soulless existence.
								</p>
								<p>
									Simplest of all is yoga, which can be introduced in a very gentle undemanding manner,
									particularly if there is a complete understanding of the absolute importance of
									breathing in a full and relaxed manner. There is a caution, however, for some use
									yoga to achieve deep mental "emptiness" - often ending group sessions with a led
									meditation - and such is anathema for anyone who is trying to maintain control of
									their inner mind.</p>
								<p>
									One of the most rewarding therapies that is aimed at achieving complete awareness
									and harmony within one's body is the Alexander Technique <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique">[Wikipedia]</a></span>
									- although I will be castigated for referring to it as a "therapy". The aim of the
									"lessons" as they are called is to help a person rediscover their true physical
									self. Many musicians avail themselves of the practices, for their profession is
									one in which physical stresses become embedded in the body, and which can lead to
									distortion of the frame.
								</p>
								<p>
									The feeling of walking tall and gracefully that the Technique engenders has to be
									felt to be appreciated. As with acupuncture, I have experienced fully the practice
									at the hands of a well qualified teacher, and very well remember the revelation
									of even the first lesson, as my body enjoyed the release and renewal that can be
									engendered.
								</p>
								<p>
									As well as the actual benefits for myself, it means that I can now write from personal
									experience, which is, after all, the only stance from which one can either praise
									or criticise. Too often, therapies and practices are condemned out of hand from
									uninformed prejudice. I sometimes think that there would be a seismic shift in the
									way in which mental ill-health is treated if the psychiatrists and other practitioners
									had first to experience themselves the therapies and drugs that they prescribe for
									patients. A course of, say, five E.C.T.s, plus a fortnight on each of the major
									drugs such as Prozac, Librium et al would soon focus minds - minds that might then
									be prompted to press for less invasive and mind suppressing "therapies".
								</p>
								<p>
									I described above how the anal and bladder sphincters are kept in a state of constant
									contraction that has become the norm. It is only after one has perfected the technique
									of releasing them at will that one realises the extent of the contraction, and experiences
									the inner relaxation that release can bring.
								</p>
								<p>
									In <i>The Secret of the Ring Muscles </i>Paula Garbourg presents a therapy that
									takes one aback by its very simplicity. She describes a series of exercises that
									mobilise the sphincters and through them induce striking benefits in many parts
									of the body that are remote from the site of the exercise. As well as the actual
									and obvious sphincters, the author treats other groups of muscles as if they also
									are sphincters, and the benefits of exercise are remarkable - and the exercises
									are so <i>simple</i>!
								</p>
								<p>
									One immediate benefit resulting from the release of the anal and bladder sphincters
									is that there is a slackening of the constriction that is perpetually locked on
									the lower end of the throat. The upper region of the chest becomes less tense, and
									breathing is deeper and more relaxed - and the body and mind start to lose the "hunted"
									feeling that is induced by the constant listening into the mind. <i>All</i> of these
									steps - so simple in themselves - when taken regularly have the effect of awakening
									lost sensations within the body, sensations associated with <u>happiness</u>! And
									gradually the mind begins to believe in the possibility of release, control and
									joy.</p>
								<p>
									If you are a carer and leading the process, the picture of a three-legged race might
									help you to see your role more clearly. At first, self-motivation is almost
									completely beyond the capability of someone who has had their inner strengths of
									will and decision making eliminated by the intrusions that have been working so
									skilfully. Ideally there should be available the resources of an organisation that
									somehow manages to combine the approach of the Camphill communities, the attitude
									that is still being developed in such centres as the Retreat Hospital in York, and
									the perceptive outreach found in organisations such as the "Gentle Approach to Cancer"
									with its concepts of mutual support and encouragement - support and encouragement
									for carers as well as the mentally disturbed. </p>

									I'm sorry to have to write it again, but I do not believe that the agenda of those
									who are promoting the idea of "Mad Pride" is the one that will endear the majority
									of people who are trying to rebuild their lives after mental illness. Most individuals
									want simply to have the quiet support and understanding that provide a firm foundation
									from which to redevelop and recover their own vision of a life that is worth living.</p>
								<p>
									That is the most important vision of all - <i>their</i> vision, not one dictated
									or imposed from outside by others. It is exceedingly difficult in <i>any</i> relationship
									to discover what the other person's vision and agenda are, but no relationship will
									truly succeed unless both vision and agenda are open and clear to both parties.
								</p>
								<p>
									How then do you explore those of someone who cannot believe that they have a stable
									future in which they have control of their own mind? How do you discover what is
									<i>really</i> going on in the mind of <i>anyone</i>, let alone someone who is or
									has been mentally disturbed? How do you form a compact with them, a relationship
									in which they will feel free and not threatened?
								</p>
								<p>
									Too often a relationship can develop into something that is not free and lightly
									balanced, and in which one side becomes dominant at the expense of the other. This
									is true of all human relationships, but is much more difficult in those where one
									partner is still struggling to find their own identity, and where the other, the
									carer, has the problems associated with trying to keep their own life going evenly,
									over possibly many years of coping.
								</p>
								<p>
									Satellite television has brought me a fascinating window on a wider world and the
									opportunities to observe and try to understand people from a vast range of cultures
									- people whom one saw, if one saw them at all, as "performers" in documentaries
									or devised programmes, and subject to the presentation and interpretation of the
									programmes' compilers. Now I can watch them completely untainted by the intervening
									"editor interpreter". </p>
								<p>
									I watch them [in foreign languages] in their own dramas, chat shows, news bulletins
									and a variety of presentations and versions of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"
									I look at faces and expressions, moods and reactions, but "look" and "watch" are
									the two operative words, for apart from sensing the general mood of the piece I
									have not the slightest idea of what is being said.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I watch Chinese television there are subtitles - but they also are in Chinese.
									I would dearly like to know what Dunia and the people whom she interviews on Abu
									Dhabi television are discussing, because it appears to be serious and intelligent,
									but apart from words that sound vaguely like "Iraq" there is nothing to guide me.
									Worse still is a news bulletin when the person being interviewed is speaking English,
									but is then being talked over and the screen has rolling subtitles all in Arabic.</p>
								<p>
									The world and outlook of those who are locked into their inner voices is something
									like this. They have their own transmission received inside their head that no one
									else can hear or comprehend, while, viewed on the screen of life that is going on
									outside them, they see people, faces expressions, actions, moods and reactions,
									and try to interpret something that is far off, something that is almost unreachable
									from within a mind and body that are often numbed by the drugs that are meant to
									make life more bearable (but which often are there solely to "contain" them) - a
									world with which they find it increasingly difficult to communicate, to such an
									extent that attempts to do so may be abandoned altogether, especially when the inner
									world can be warm and friendly.</p>
								<p>
									Is it easiest simply to abandon them to their inner world and the companions that
									frequent it? An inner world that can be welcoming, friendly, comforting - an inner
									world that suddenly can spawn terror and threat; create immeasurable anxiety; propose
									devilish and obscene compacts - compacts that if accepted can bring down an even
									heavier rain of threat and castigation from the unseen tormentors. One can go on
									and on in seemingly endless speculation, and offer insights and advice that may
									or may not have relevance to an individual - if indeed one knew that the torment
									was actually there behind the closed door that a life and the face fronting it have
									become.</p>
								<p>
									It would be difficult to forget the time when my stable was being reroofed. Right
									to the fore of the action were the two Geordies - Big Derek and Brian. They came
									and worked - and worked hard - for "readies", and stayed until about one o'clock
									when they went to the King's Head for a liquid lunch, and then possibly an afternoon
									fishing off the beach. One morning they came and they were immensely subdued, in
									fact for such a big man it was odd that Derek seemed close to tears. "Clarry's topped
									his self" said Brian eventually. Work was pointless, and they went off to the King's
									Head for more appropriate solace. Clarry - or Clarence to give him his Sunday name
									- had farmed with brother Ronnie, until they had given up the farm. But farmers
									never retire, and one met them here and there as they helped out on other farms
									- hedging, dykeing, hay-timing - or working in people's gardens.</p>
								<p>
									Clarry had retired to a cottage beside the main road and I saw him frequently as
									he worked around a friend's premises. This particular morning, his daughter had
									come downstairs, to a fire newly laid in the grate, a cup of tea part drunk and
									still warm, a sandwich half eaten, and, puzzled, had gone outside to find Clarry
									hanging. And no one knew why! It was over ten years ago, and I don't think anyone
									knows to this day. There in his inner world something had thrown a switch - but
									he had not been ill that anyone knew about - certainly not mentally. What was it
									that Clarry couldn't talk to anyone about - confide - consult?</p>
								<p>
									I thought of him in happier times, as for instance when the local Shepherds' Meet
									and a meet of the beagles had coincided, and the Brown Cow had been open all day
									- and Clarry hadn't wasted a minute. There he was, well into the evening, a huge
									turkey drumstick in his hand, beating time to the choruses of the hunting songs,
									and swaying perilously to and fro, and the picture of him swaying gently at the
									end of a rope is one that even now I find unbearable.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have difficulty revisiting the time when I desperately wanted to die and escape
									from all that plagued my mind and the situation that I couldn't understand but from
									which I frantically wanted to flee. I wasn't then hearing voices, but had seemingly
									insurmountable problems. Why didn't I just do it? As I wrote earlier, it had to
									appear to be an accident, and I couldn't devise one that I thought would be convincing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Relevant to my thoughts about Clarry - I couldn't talk to anyone, because I couldn't
									put my inner agony into words. I vaguely remember once saying to the Consultant,
									MC, as I attempted to broach the subject, something such as "I wish I had a terminal
									illness" - thinking that that would be a way out that would not create problems
									for anyone. "I suppose you want cancer" he said - and said it with a sneer; nothing
									else will describe his tone. I never tried to speak to anyone about it ever again,
									and I have only recalled the painful times for the purpose of writing to you to
									help you to understand the torment in the unseen world behind the facade of a face,
									and a life that is seemingly being "lived" successfully.</p>
								<p>
									"Writing to you" - I began to write more then five years ago. Some has come easy;
									some with the pain of unhappiness and disaster revisited. I hope that it has been
									worthwhile in that it may help someone. I began with the words of the diminutive
									Brazilian bishop, Dom Helder Camera - and cannot think of any that are more appropriate
									to end with.
								</p>
								<p align="center">
									Don't get annoyed<br />
									If the people coming to see you,<br />
									If the people wanting to talk to you<br />
									Can't manage to express<br />
									The uproar raging inside them.
								</p>
								<p align="center">
									Much more important<br />
									Than listening to the words<br />
									Is imagining the agonies<br />
									Fathoming the mystery<br />
									... Listening to the silences ...
