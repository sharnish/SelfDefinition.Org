									Following graduation as an electrical engineer in 1950, I came north from my native
									Wales, to the Lake District to work at the Sellafield nuclear plant. I spent all
									of my working life there, and continue to live in and enjoy this spectacular part
									of the country. My chief role was as an Instrumentation Engineer in the chemical
									plants, and, principally, within the Calder Hall power station.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many and varied were the types of measurement made, and many and varied were the
									devices and techniques that were used. But of all this variety, by far the most
									important, and sometimes most difficult, was the measurement of radioactivity in
									its diverse forms. The measurements were necessary for the safe and efficient operation
									of the various processes, and - of prime importance - for the safety of the operatives
									and the public at large.</p>
								<p>
									Alpha and beta particles, neutrons and gamma rays - all were there, all potentially
									dangerous and harmful - and all were invisible. But more than that, they could only
									be detected by their effect upon something else - a device that produced little
									flashes of light with each particle; the change in voltage in some other contrivance
									- and so on. Properly harnessed and controlled as in a reactor, these dangers became
									converted into a benevolent source of electrical power.</p>
								<p>
									In 1979, and several years after my early retirement, I began to experience another
									phenomenon - one that is entirely invisible, potentially uncontrollable, dangerous
									and even "life-threatening" to the life of the mind and spirit, and yet of immense
									power in its benevolent form - but only discernible through its effect upon the
									human person through the mind and senses.
								</p>
								<p>
									In that year I began to hear voices and experience the full gamut of spiritual intrusion
									and interaction. In that year,
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"a 'presence' that I couldn't see, moved from the space in front of me, into me,
										and immediately my mind was charged with another 'voice' or provoker of thoughts,
										thoughts over which then I had no control, and which were not initiated by me. In
										my head began conversation as between two separate people, one of whom was me. I
										began to 'hear voices'."
									</p>
									<p>
										"... Thus in almost 25 years I have never been free from intrusions that enter blatantly
										or subliminally into my mind and mental faculties, and forcefully or subtly into
										my body and senses."
									</p>

								<p>
									My older brother is an Anglican clergyman, and from his late teens he has had a
									profound prayer life. From that time, and subsequently since ordination, he has
									been aware of spiritual presence, and the movement within himself as either he settles
									to prayer, or he consecrates the Eucharist. His mental response has always been
									- "If you are from God you are welcome: if not, please go."</p>
								<p>
									What each of us in his own way is really acknowledging is that there are intelligent,
									freely acting "entities", "beings", "spirits" - call them what one will - and that
									they are able to move without restraint into the human person, both physically and
									mentally. In detail I can only write of my own experiences - experiences that have
									involved the intensely benevolent, the consummately malevolent and others of indeterminate
									behaviour. I am aware of the concepts of "earthbound spirits" and of "lost souls"
									attached to individuals or places, although I have never been able to reconcile
									myself with, or understand the proposition of "soul fragments": however, none of
									these are within my experience.</p>
								<p>
									What I do know with certainty is that in every culture that has ever left a record
									anywhere on the Earth, this truth has been acknowledged, and a religion or philosophy
									has emerged that prescribes ways of living in concert with "spiritual good" and
									avoiding contact with, or the damaging effects of "spiritual evil".</p>
								<p>
									In everything that I have written or spoken about these matters since I first became
									aware, I have had one purpose, and one only. My purpose has been this: namely to
									try to convince anyone who would listen or read that the presence of intrusive malevolent
									"spirits" is the cause of much mental disturbance. Undoubtedly it is the prime cause
									of schizophrenia, and may be a major component of manic depression, multiple personality,
									obsessions, compulsions and behavioural problems.</p>
								<p>
									My experiences and resultant arguments are described fully in my book, and I can
									do no more than indicate a few conclusions. I do not write of anything that could
									be described as "spirit release", because the unwanted spirits with which one is
									dealing are intelligent, cunning and have free will. Instead I have written to inform
									and encourage and to suggest ways of coping and regaining control.</p>
								<p>
									I have tried to be careful in that I do not suggest that every mental aberration
									is the result of adverse spiritual activity. This was a danger that became manifest
									during the last major "spirit release" movement - at the time of the so-called "charismatic
									renewal" of the nineteen seventies and eighties.
								</p>
								<p>
									Believing that the "charisms" - the gifts of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost - were
									for everyone, lay and ordained alike, many groups were formed, many were speaking
									in tongues, and many were trying individual or group "exorcisms". There was much
									uncontrolled enthusiasm, and there were acknowledged instances of minds being damaged
									by, particularly, the DIY exorcisms. (And even now, for only recently I read of
									an eight year old autistic boy in Milwaukee who died wrapped in sheets in a church
									service to "exorcise evil spirits".)</p>
								<p>
									Undoubtedly there are responsible minds at work in the current and growing awareness,
									and several and varied are the books now available that record the work and practices.
									However, there are also those who are regarding "spirit release" as another "Brownie
									badge" to sew on their sleeve, alongside Reiki, hypnotism and hypnotherapy, past
									life regression and Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP), channelling and "readings",
									aromatherapy, shamanism, et al.</p>
								<p>
									There is already a seriously debased currency in the training and practice offered
									in some of these and other "complementary" activities. In Reiki, for the expenditure
									of two weekends and &pound;550, one can become a Reiki Master, capable of "training
									and empowering" other aspirants; two weekends in which one can "... learn many professional
									(sic) techniques and possibly heal or cure ... psychic attack, auric knots, lost
									spirits ... as well as Rainbow Reiki, NLP ...". There are allegedly some who will
									offer "empowerment" over the phone!</p>
								<p>
									The Web will reveal a number of sites that offer training in hypnotism and hypnotherapy
									- "training" that involves no actual contact between the trainer and aspirant, only
									taped sessions, with a final certificate that guarantees access to a lucrative source
									of income in activities that include past life regression and NLP - "Jump start
									your career for the Millennium" said one advert.
								</p>
								<p>
									I once underwent hypnotism that was practised by someone whom I knew to be competent
									and well trained. As I was about to be "submerged" I felt my person being entered
									by a spiritual entity, and was still sufficiently alert to hold myself back from
									the deep state of hypnosis. I was aware that had I carried on I could have been
									used and spoken through, as would be a psychic medium. This to me is one of the
									greatest dangers of hypnotism and regression - how can anyone possibly know what
									is going on or "who" is speaking through the one being "regressed"?
								</p>
								<p>
									Equally damaging is the stage hypnotist - opening minds in a very charged atmosphere
									- for "entertainment". The human mind with its vulnerability to spiritual intrusion
									should not be treated merely as a source of income for entertainers, no matter how
									great the reputation that they have acquired. "The fastest way to learn stage hypnotism
									and enhance your income" said yet another Web site.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is possible to buy DIY books on how to "channel" - how to "give oneself "psychic
									protection"; work with guides and angels; conduct channelled readings" - and no
									doubt contribute to the flood of wisdom that is poured out in constant stream from
									"Ascended Masters" - with names that range from Aldebran to Zed. A weekend workshop
									will produce a certificate in Aromatherapy, the practice of which can involve the
									use of oils that have been demonstrated as having profound effects upon the moods
									and mental states of susceptible individuals.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Shamanism" leaves me completely baffled, for I just cannot bridge what I see as
									the vast gulf between those who identify themselves as "shaymans", and the picture
									that I derive from the description in Encyclopaedia Britannica of the origins, upbringing
									and subsequent life, and the "sorcery and magic", of the genuine Siberian Shaman.
									<span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism_in_Siberia">[Wikipedia]</a></span>
								</p>
								<p>
									The human mind and spirit are not there as playgrounds for the dilettante or dabbler.
									Even the professionals in the workings of the mind can make serious mistakes, as
									I found to my cost when my own mind was in dire danger of suffering serious and
									permanent damage as the result of a medical misdiagnosis, inappropriate and totally
									unnecessary medication, and the machinations of a consultant psychiatrist who could
									admit in correspondence to "lacunae in my training".
								</p>
								<p>Concerning the potential dangers
									to my "spirit", I was the author of my own peril through the innocent and gullible
									use of a pendulum in dowsing. However, if I had not done so, I would not have been
									able to write as I have done, nor to be constant and insistent, as I shall be while
									I live, in declaring that spiritual intrusion is a reality, and is the source and
									cause of many cases of mental disturbance and illness. Conversely, I am equally
									insistent in my acknowledgement of the existence of a powerful and universal source
									of benevolent spirituality.</p>
								<p>
									As for the fairies - well, I am sure that you can make up your own mind about them,
									although, having said that, I once knew a lady, alas now dead, who had a pencil
									drawing that she had made from sight of a fairy that she had seen among the flowers
									in her garden. It was an excellent drawing ...
