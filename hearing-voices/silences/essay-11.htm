                                    Now there's a saucy little phrase - guaranteed to produce a smile, a giggle or a
                                    smirk. There is even a comedy play written with that as the title. But after the
                                    smile, giggle or smirk, what then? When and where and to whom did it apply?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I first heard it from my friend Roger, in his authentic Tyneside accents, when it
                                    sounded like "All fur coat and nee knickers". Roger at eighty-five is even older
                                    than me, and being of that age, and being born and brought up in Jarrow on Tyneside,
                                    he remembered well the desperate days of the Great Depression of the 'twenties and
                                    early 'thirties, when poverty and near starvation existed. He described how the
                                    worthy ladies from the more well-off parts of Newcastle provided food, soup kitchens
                                    and other charitable help. While their charity and concern were so much appreciated,
                                    these ladies were nevertheless described by the women of Jarrow as being "All fur
                                    coats and knee knickers".</p>
                                <p>
                                    Yes, dear friends, while the local women probably could not even afford underwear,
                                    the kind dispensers of charity wore what would have been described discreetly as
                                    "directoire" knickers, or more commonly "bloomers" or "passion killers", having
                                    elastic in the leg ends that came above or below the knee. I remember them well
                                    when as a lad one saw them blowing and filling with the breeze on the Monday morning
                                    clothes lines, and where the wind-filled "bum" provided a satisfying target for
                                    a young boy with an airgun!</p>
                                <p>
                                    That is the truth of the matter, Roger assures me, but in spite of that, many people
                                    much prefer the saucy rendering, the truth being too tame or uninteresting. How
                                    many times in life does one encounter the attitude - "Don't bother me with facts,
                                    they only confuse the issue"? Roger became a good friend - largely through his daughter
                                    Val who, beginning as my secretary at work, became an exceptionally good friend,
                                    especially at a time when I needed friends. He and I had both been at sea - Roger
                                    in the Merchant Navy and myself in the Royal one - and anecdotes naturally flowed
                                    to and fro.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I well remember the time leading up to my volunteering in 1943, when I read everything
                                    that I could find that had connection with the sea, and the Royal Navy in particular.
                                    Had I been aware of its existence, I would have devoured The Sailor's Word-Book.
                                    Compiled by Admiral W.H.Smyth during a naval career that stretched from the last
                                    years of the eighteenth century until well into the nineteenth, the book includes
                                    over 14,000 nautical and naval terms. While Admiral Smyth included what he called
                                    "cant" terms and "galley slang", in all of the 14,000 words there is not a single
                                    one that is obscene or objectionable.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Which is vastly different from what I experienced on the lower deck as I progressed
                                    from Ordinary Seaman to Petty Officer Radar Mechanic. The air in the mess-decks
                                    resounded with every known excretory, genital or copulatory word imaginable - alone,
                                    or in vastly "poetical" combinations. Coming from the sort of background in which
                                    I had grown up, they had never been used, nor did I find them necessary. Others
                                    wanted to find expletives without using the obscene, and so "bugger" became "badger",
                                    while the word that even today is still the most objectionable, was reversed and
                                    became "chuff". Thus, "Chuff off!" - Please go away. "Chuff it!" - Oh dear! I have
                                    hurt my finger. "Chuff me!" and "Well I'm chuffed!" - Gosh! How surprised I am!</p>
                                <p>
                                    There is scope for someone to research and write a doctoral thesis that examines
                                    the route that took these pseudo-obscenities into the everyday speech where they
                                    are now terms of praise or satisfaction. While "chuffed" is used by all levels of
                                    society, for me it is still redolent of the lower deck; and when someone says they
                                    had been "very chuffed", I think "shouldn't you be having a rest?" To be "dead chuffed"
                                    has me speculating on some bizarre form of necrophilia!</p>
                                <p>
                                    Thus, in less than a lifetime, the two expressions have experienced a total change
                                    of meaning - "knee knickers" have become "no knickers", and "chuff" has done a volte-face
                                    from pseudo-obscenity to terms of approval.</p>
                                <p>
                                    These are two fairly light hearted examples of how meanings and shades of meaning
                                    can change, often through the ignorant or thoughtless use by individuals who want
                                    a glib or "important" sounding word in their speech or writing. Some words completely
                                    lose their original meaning - look up "mayhem" and "garble", for instance - while
                                    others are being used in their full spectrum from original meaning to acquired meanings
                                    by different individuals and groups, with what resultant confusion, one can only
                                    guess. And while you have the dictionary open, why not look at homogenous and homogeneous?
                                    Used by many - even prominent broadcasters and top ranking politicians - as if they
                                    are synonymous, they are not even mildly related, and their difference could not
                                    be greater.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I have had cause to think yet again about the dire consequences that such misuse
                                    of words, or of mal-applied words, can create in the life of a person since getting
                                    to know "Elizabeth". I introduced her into my writing in a recent article entitled
                                    "Two Fools". <span class="footnote"><a href="essay-10.htm">essay-10.htm</a></span>
                                    In her thirty years, she has had many strange experiences that have brought her
                                    frequent encounters with psychiatry. The several "personalities" that she exhibits
                                    or that inhabit her have drawn upon her the latest label - "dissociation of personality".</p>
                                <p>
                                    She has told me much of her history, although new elements keep emerging and keep
                                    me wondering how such a short life can have had so much in it that causes me to
                                    feel distress at the hearing. Elizabeth concedes that my own experiences of spiritual
                                    intrusion into my mind and body have many parallels in hers also, but has been convinced
                                    of the reality of the term "dissociation", and of its relevance to herself. Looking
                                    up the word in <i>The Oxford Companion to the Mind</i>, I find myself more confused
                                    than enlightened.
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        "Dissociation of the personality is a puzzling and indeed disturbing phenomenon,
                                        since it calls into question the basic assumption that we all make about human nature,
                                        namely that for every body there is but one person; that each of us, despite the
                                        passage of time and changes of mood and activity, remains the same person with a
                                        single biography and store of memories ... Dissociation of the personality is not
                                        only bizarre but also extremely rare - so rare, indeed, that one has to take seriously
                                        the possibility that it may be a social and psychiatric artefact i.e. that it can
                                        only occur if (1) prevailing views of personality make it conceivable that two personalities
                                        can occupy the same bodily frame, and (2) the potential case of split or multiple
                                        personality encounters a psychiatrist who believes in, or is already interested
                                        in, dissociation of the personality.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Indeed, the great majority of reported case of multiple personality date from between
                                        1840 and 1910 - that is, from after demoniacal possession had ceased to be a plausible,
                                        scientifically acceptable explanation of sudden, extraordinary changes in personality
                                        until the time at which psychoanalytical ideas began to have an impact."

                                    (As the article progresses, I can hear the sound of many axes of personal prejudice
                                    being ground, and can perceive mildly slanderous suggestions concerning the propriety
                                    and motives of the psychoanalysts involved at the time).</p>

                                    Make no mistake about it, Elizabeth is an intelligent woman; without all of these
                                    negative influences in her life she would have gone to university and would have
                                    shone. She writes fluently, coherently and with purpose, and currently is writing
                                    to inform others about the nature of "dissociation". But as well as trying to inform
                                    others, she is also trying hard to inform herself, and to that end ordered a very
                                    expensive book. However, it is only my intervention that has preserved the book
                                    intact between its covers. What she read has made her very, very angry, for reasons
                                    that I shall come to, and I am now custodian of <i>Understanding Dissociative Disorders</i>
                                    by Marlene E. Hunter, MD - described as "A guide for Family Physicians and Health
                                    Care Professionals."</p>
                                <p>
                                    With books of this nature, I am not a "dipper in", but begin at the introduction
                                    and proceed. Naturally, I first read the cover blurb, and find that the author "is
                                    world renowned for her work with medical hypnosis and dissociative disorders." In
                                    the opening pages, Dr Hunter introduces a patient whom she names "Jayere", and begins:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        "As our doctor-patient relationship became established and grew, I became more and
                                        more confused. She had had, from previous family doctors, twelve psychiatric referrals.
                                        These resulted in twelve diagnoses. I made the thirteenth referral, and thus she
                                        received the thirteenth diagnosis - that she had a neurological disorder, not a
                                        psychiatric problem. The neurologist, however, said in no uncertain terms that she
                                        had a psychiatric problem, not a neurological disorder, although he could not account
                                        for the fact that on two separate occasions she had two distinctly different EEGs."

                                    As I read that, I was carried back in my mind some thirty years, to when I had begun
                                    to read a book that had a profound influence on my life. I still have it - an insignificant
                                    paperback that was written by Dr. Richard Mackarness and which is called <i>Not All
                                        in the Mind</i>. Dr. Mackarness similarly begins with a case study - in fact,
                                    a "presentation" at eleven o'clock on Wednesday morning 23 May 1973 at Park Prewett
                                    Hospital. The "case" was "Joanna", and her psychiatric history that he relates is
                                    frankly frightening - especially if you had been Joanna!</p>
                                <p>
                                    She had been admitted thirteen times, often compulsorily because the psychiatrists
                                    called by the general practitioner to see her at home had considered her to be a
                                    danger to her children and herself. In her most disturbed phases, she would slash
                                    her forearms with any nearby sharp object; had done some bizarre things to her children,
                                    including throwing one through a closed window (fortunately on the ground floor)
                                    ... and so on for several paragraphs. Most of the psychiatrists at the Hospital
                                    had had Joanna under their care, and almost every diagnostic label in the book had
                                    been attached to her illness: schizophrenia, schizo-affective psychosis, pre-senile
                                    dementia, temporal lobe epilepsy, neurotic depression and anxiety hysteria.</p>
                                <p>
                                    As the presentation proceeded, the majority opinion was that the only solution was
                                    leucotomy, <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy">[lobotomy]</a></span>
                                    as in her thirteen admissions Joanna had failed to respond to every known combination
                                    of psychotropic drugs as well as several courses of E.C.T. Mackarness used all of
                                    his persuasive powers to be allowed to try his experimental methods as a last shot
                                    before the drastic action of leucotomy, and his colleagues agreed - more or less
                                    on the lines that "well at least it will do no harm!" He had been influenced by
                                    work in other countries that had found that in many instances, mental health problems
                                    originated in food intolerance or allergy.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The procedure was simple, and began with a five-day spring water fast followed by
                                    test doses of suspected foods. In the event, Joanna was found to have strong reactions
                                    to chocolate, bacon, coffee, egg, and one or two other lesser items. Three months
                                    after discharge Joanna was "happy, euphoric, sometimes almost hypo manic in her
                                    hearty enjoyment of life. She goes out to work, cares for her children without harming
                                    them and seems almost back to her old self ..."</p>
                                <p>
                                    My recollections of Mackarness' book, and of the GP who had introduced me to it
                                    took a little time to disperse, although the similarity of the situations and the
                                    thirteen previous referrals stayed with me as I came back to dissociation and Jayere,
                                    who sat with Dr. Hunter and prepared to be hypnotised. Dr. Hunter, much against
                                    her own instinct, had decided to explore a suggestion made by an older colleague
                                    who had askd whether she had ever thought of multiple personality disorder. Thus
                                    she writes:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        "So, with gritted teeth and feeling scared stiff, I gathered all my courage together
                                        at one of my next meetings with Jayere and asked while she was under hypnosis (we
                                        were working on relieving the headaches), 'Is there any other part of you who would
                                        like to come and speak with me'?"</p>
                                    <p>
                                        And this entirely different gruff voice said, "Of course! What took you so long?"</p>
                                </blockquote>

                                    Once again I was transported, and to yet another book - <i>Remarkable Healings</i>
                                    and a different author - psychiatrist, Dr. Shakuntali Modi. Dr. Modi is also a hypnotherapist,
                                    and paralleling Dr. Hunter, made her own discoveries purely by chance. Many of her
                                    patients, under hypnosis, claimed to have spirits attached to their bodies and energy
                                    fields, creating psychological and physical problems. It is a book of 630 pages,
                                    and I will not attempt even a simple synopsis.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Like Dr. Hunter, Dr. Modi speaks to the patients "inner beings", but with the difference
                                    that she knows that she is speaking to "attached" or "embedded" spirits or entities
                                    or ... whom/what? Semantics, semantics, semantics ... we have lost a common vocabulary
                                    and the loss means that it is exceptionally difficult to share these thoughts and
                                    experiences with others who have no spiritual beliefs or experiences, or who belong
                                    to a different culture and religion that have entrenched and dogmatic limitations.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Thus when Dr. Modi writes of God; Angels; soul parts; past lives; and so on, readers
                                    have to make up their own minds - but let me say this: she cures people!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My own true spiritual development began with the events of 28 years ago, when first
                                    I began to hear voices and experience spiritual intrusion, and I have done my best
                                    to write about them in my book. I have had experiences that have taken me from encounters
                                    with deep evil to others with ineffable goodness, and have been made aware, in ways
                                    that leave me without the remotest shadow of doubt, of the existence of independently
                                    acting, highly intelligent and physically powerful "spirits", "beings" - call them
                                    what you will.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have never thought specifically of "Angels" in the traditional sense, nor related
                                    that title to those benevolent ones that I encounter - I find the concept mildly
                                    embarrassing. So, when re-reading a part of Remarkable Healings, and Dr. Modi's
                                    specific reference to such beings, I thought that maybe I should smarten up my act,
                                    and be rather more polite when I experience direct intervention from such a possible
                                    source, for some of my responses have been on the "vigorous" side.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At which thought, a warm and amused voice came into my mind with the words "Please
                                    don't change, Roy, we value you as you are." The accompanying, enveloping ambience
                                    of love can only be described by analogy, as when I came home on survivor's leave
                                    after my ship had been mined, and I had been blown up, burned and hospitalised.
                                    The hug from my father just didn't need words.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I find it difficult - indeed, very difficult to write about the positive, benign
                                    spiritual influences. In my desire to avoid any perception of "triumphalism", of
                                    being "chosen", I tend to shy away from any but the most cursory descriptions; and
                                    anyway, many of the interchanges are deeply personal, often tinged with emotion
                                    and coloured by my own religious beliefs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have related some of the more light-hearted exchanges in the sequence of my story
                                    within my book, and will add just one, which while not "light hearted", nevertheless
                                    is highly practical, considering my age. Nearing 82, it is inevitable that one will
                                    think speculatively about the reality of the transition from this life into a spiritual
                                    one, and from time to time I share thoughts with my older brother - not in any maudlin
                                    sense, but "I wonder what, where and when ...?" Recently I was immersed deeply in
                                    such a speculation, when a voice in my head said "Don't worry Roy. You will be met
                                    - and tell your brother the same."</p>
                                <p>
                                    Highly reassuring to both of us, and I was instantly taken back to my mother's bedside
                                    as she lay dying. It was obvious that mentally she had left this world, and was
                                    in conversation with "others". It was also obvious from what she was saying, that
                                    one of the "others" was her sister Ethel, and I heard my mother say distinctly -
                                    "When will I meet my mother?"</p>
                                <p>
                                    The reassuring voice that I heard in my mind was of a vastly different quality from
                                    those that harass and torment and try to pass themselves off as being from the "benign".
                                    Try as I will, I cannot find a suitable description.
                                </p>

                                    For those who have not yet read my book, let me emphasise that I am not some head
                                    in the air ethereal wimp. The whole of my career was one of practicality and reality,
                                    from when I was responsible for navigation radar of a destroyer at sea, to when
                                    I managed a department at the Sellafield Nuclear plant, where my work in measurement
                                    and safety for the whole of the Calder Nuclear Power Reactors carried immense responsibility.
                                    A career that was advancing well, but which was cut off as the result of a medical
                                    misdiagnosis, completely inappropriate medication and dodgy psychiatry. I am now
                                    approaching 82 years of age, and you will have to judge for yourself whether I am
                                    <i>compos mentis</i>!
                                </p>

                                    Looking back from this number of years, it is inevitable that times of reminiscence
                                    will produce their quota of "if only ...", and "I wonder what would have happened
                                    if ..." For me, the thoughts apply particularly to the sequences in my subsequent
                                    life (lives?) since I experienced the first spiritual intrusion and the onset of
                                    "voices". On the plus side was the fact that I discovered that I had the talents
                                    of a natural healer, and through them came face to face with one of life's paradoxes.
                                    "I'm glad that I had cancer ..." was what I sometimes heard as I gave help at a
                                    cancer care centre that followed the so-called "Bristol" approach, and as the person
                                    revealed the extent to which they had discovered the reality of the "spiritual"
                                    in their life.</p>
                                <p>
                                    There have been many, many times when I have cursed the intrusions into my mind
                                    and body - I still do - but, on balance, I say the same as the cancer patients about
                                    the revelations that have come to me about the "spiritual" in my own life - "I'm
                                    glad that it happened." Particularly so in relation to the understanding that emerged
                                    of the reality and practicality of the Christianity to which I had been signed up
                                    at my baptism.

                                    When I look back at all of the theorising, all of the dogma and theology, all of
                                    the polemic, all the sermons and homilies that I have heard, the hymns that I have
                                    sung - they stand as naught compared with the realisation that Christianity is a
                                    practical religion; a religion for doing. All of my engineering life - which makes
                                    it all of my adult life, for I still live and think with the mind of an engineer
                                    - I have worked with the practical and pragmatic. Does it work? Yes it does. Then
                                    do it. That is why I echo the words of the Ronseal paint advert - "If you do what
                                    it says on the tin - it does what it says on the tin!"

                                        of one of Emanuel Swedenborg's more unusual findings: that man's life involves an
                                        interaction with a hierarchy of spirits. This reaction is normally not conscious,
                                        but perhaps in some cases of mental illness it has become conscious.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        For sixteen years, I worked as a clinical psychologist in one of the country's better
                                        mental hospitals (Mendocino State Hospital, Ukiah, California; now closed). Out
                                        of both my professional role and human interest, I examined thousands of mentally
                                        ill persons. An accidental discovery in 1964 permitted me to get a much more detailed
                                        and accurate picture of psychotic hallucinations than had previously been possible.
                                        Though I gradually noticed similarities between patients' reports and Swedenborg's
                                        description of the relationships of man to spirits, it was only three years after
                                        all my major findings on hallucinations had been made that the striking similarity
                                        between the two became apparent to me. I then collected as many details as possible
                                        of his description. I found that Swedenborg's system not only is an almost perfect
                                        fit with patients' experiences, but even more impressively, it accounts for otherwise
                                        quite puzzling aspects of hallucinations.</p>

                                        Mentally ill persons are out of sorts with their environment and need supervision,
                                        care, or restraint for their protection or the welfare of others. If they are very
                                        disturbed or apparently responding to invisible others, the staff may decide they
                                        are hallucinating. Most hallucinating people conceal this experience because they
                                        know it is unusual and may indicate madness. At best our patients would tell us
                                        of a few striking hallucinations from the past. An unusually cooperative patient
                                        led me to ask if I could talk directly with her hallucinations. I did, and she gave
                                        me their immediate response. I had stumbled upon a way to get a much richer picture
                                        of the inner world of hallucinations."</p>

                                    I take issue with the author over his constant use of the terms "hallucinations"
                                    and "delusions". These words imply unreality: to the ones who experience them, they
                                    are without doubt real. That proviso apart, much of what Van Dusen wrote matches
                                    some of my own experiences. Here is another brief extract:</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        "One consistent finding was that patients felt they had contact with another world
                                        or order of beings. Most thought these other persons were living. All objected to
                                        the term "hallucination." Each coined his own term, such as the Other Order, the
                                        Eavesdroppers, air phone, etc. For most individuals the hallucinations came on suddenly.
                                        One woman was working in the garden when an unseen man addressed her. Another man
                                        described sudden loud noises and voices he heard while riding in a bus. Most were
                                        frightened, and adjusted with difficulty to this new experience.

                                        "All the patients described voices as having the quality of a real voice, sometimes
                                        louder, sometimes softer, than normal voices. The experience they described was
                                        quite unlike thoughts or fantasies: when things are seen they appear fully real
                                        ... Most patients soon realize that they are having experiences that others do not
                                        share, and for this reason learn to keep quiet about them. Many suffer insults,
                                        threats, and attacks for years from voices with no one around them aware of it."

                                        "In my dialogues with patients, I learned of two orders of experience, borrowing
                                        from the voices themselves, called the higher and the lower order. Lower-order voices
                                        are similar to drunken bums at a bar who like to tease and torment just for the
                                        fun of it. They suggest lewd acts and then scold the patient for considering them.
                                        They find a weak point of conscience and work on it interminably. For instance,
                                        one man heard voices teasing him for three years over a ten-cent debt he had already
                                        paid. They call the patient every conceivable name, suggest every lewd act, steal
                                        memories or ideas right out of consciousness, threaten death, and work on the patient's
                                        credibility in every way.
                                    </p>

                                        "For instance, they brag that they will produce some disaster on the morrow and
                                        then claim honor for one in the daily paper. They suggest foolish acts, such as
                                        to raise your right hand in the air and stay that way, and tease if he does it and
                                        threaten him if he doesn't. The lower order can work for a long time to possess
                                        some part of the patient's body. Several worked on one patient's ear and he seemed
                                        to grow deafer. One voice worked two years to capture a patient's eye, which went
                                        visibly out of alignment.

                                        end, an apparently nerve-wracking experience. One patient saw a noose around his
                                        neck that was tied to 'I don't know what,' while voices plotted his death by hanging.
                                        They threaten pain and can cause felt pain as a way of enforcing their power. The
                                        most devastating experience of all is to be shouted at constantly by dozens of voices.
                                        When this occurred the patient became grossly disturbed and had to be sedated.

                                        undermine the patient's will. They never have a personal identity, though they accept

                                        can change or shift, leaving the patient quite confused as to who might be speaking

                                        sees, hears, or remembers. They seem imprisoned in the lowest level of the patient's
                                        mind, giving no real evidence of a personal world or of any higher-order thinking

                                        living people, though to one patient they appeared as conventional devils and referred
                                        to themselves as demons. In a few instances they referred to themselves as from
                                        hell. Occasionally they would speak through the patient so that the patient's voice
                                        and speech would be directly those of the voices.

                                        be illustrated by the experience of one man. He had heard the lower order arguing
                                        for a long while about how they would murder him. He also had a light come to him

                                        supportive, genuinely instructive; it can communicate directly with the inner feelings
                                        of the patient. I've learned to help the patient approach the higher order because
                                        of its great power to broaden the individual's values. When the man was encouraged
                                        to approach his friendly sun, he entered a world of powerful numinous experiences...

                                    <p>
                                        "In another instance, the higher order appeared to a man as a lovely woman who entertained
                                        him while showing him thousands of symbols. Though the patient was a high school-educated
                                        gas pipe fitter, his female vision showed a knowledge of religion and myth far beyond
                                        the patient's comprehension. At the end of a very rich dialogue with her (the patient
                                        reporting her symbols and responses), the patient asked for just a clue as to what
                                        she and I were talking about. Another example is that of a black man who gave up
                                        being useful and lived as a drunken thief. In his weeks of hallucinations, the higher
                                        order carefully instructed him on the trials of all minority groups and left him
                                        with the feeling he would like to do something for minorities."</p>

                                <p>
                                    I could take relevant quotations from the book <i>Healing the Family Tree</i> by
                                    psychiatrist, the late Kenneth McAll, but that would not truly advance my arguments.
                                    I will simply say that Dr. McAll recognised that some instances of mental disturbance
                                    were the result of the attachment of deceased family members to the surviving living.
                                    With the attachment, there also came the negative influences and traumas that had
                                    accompanied the deceased while they had lived. In the practice of this ministry,
                                    a family tree was drawn and the disturbing "spirit" identified, "who", during a
                                    suitable Christian ceremony or service, was asked to leave the one who was disturbed,
                                    and to try themselves to advance spiritually.</p>
                                <p>
                                    This practice was followed by someone who is a friend and who is a chaplain in a
                                    psychiatric hospital where the "spiritual" is recognised as a potent force in healing
                                    the mentally disturbed. A patient became convinced that the spirit of her deceased
                                    mother - the person who had abused her in life - was still attached and was tormenting
                                    her in her mind. Together with another chaplain and in a simple ceremony, my friend
                                    asked the attached mother to leave and be helped herself - which "she" did. For
                                    about a week the patient "mourned" the separation, and then proceeded with her own
                                    recovery. Members of the Spirit Release Foundation perform similar acts of release
                                    for disturbed individuals.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Every time that I write about the involvement of the "spiritual" in the onset of
                                    mental health problems in individuals, I have to remind myself of some of the excesses
                                    of "diagnosis" that appeared during the so-called Charismatic Renewal in various
                                    churches around the 1970's. Some groups thought that they perceived malevolent spiritual
                                    involvement in almost every case of mental illness, and DIY exorcisms abounded,
                                    with their potential for harm to the individual.

                                    Indeed, as I write I realise that I could be accused of the tunnel visionary obsessivness
                                    of those that I criticise. In my own defence I would offer the fact that everything
                                    that I write is based upon fact - admittedly, fact of which only I am aware. Nevertheless,
                                    it has been consistent for all of twenty-eight years without a break - and continues
                                    even now. In my book, I describe within the text a number of what I call "ploys"
                                    or stratagems that are used by the "intrusions", placing them in the actual circumstances
                                    or sequences in which they occurred. Some are simple while others are exceedingly
                                    complex.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I found two instances of one of the more simple ploys in the section where Dr. Hunter
                                    de-scribes her approach to patients with anorexia and with bulimia. In both, certain
                                    individuals reported how they were driven by voices in their minds; voices that
                                    led them in a dance, in that one was urging them to take one action - e.g. binge
                                    on food - while the other urged them to vomit. Dr. Hunter uses them as examples
                                    of her "ego states".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I see them as examples of the ploy that I describe, in which the positive supposedly
                                    "good" voice and the negative "bad" voice can urge an individual between two alternatives
                                    and harry him just like two greyhounds harrying a hare. A person who is trying to
                                    make a decision can find himself rooted to the spot, quivering like a jelly, incapable
                                    of even the simplest movement. From another source - a contributor to the radio
                                    programme "Am I Normal" which dealt with obsessive behaviour, described exactly
                                    the same situation, in which he had two voices, the one insisted that he washed;
                                    the other voice demanded that he should not.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Although the ploys are placed throughout the text and should be read within my complete
                                    story, or the reality of my experience will be lost, I have collected a number into
                                    part of Chapter 16. <span class="footnote"><a href="summary-of-ploys.htm">summary-of-ploys.htm</a></span>
                                    This was done for ease of reference and recall after the book had been read. However,
                                    for those who have no desire to read the complete book, the ploys are there, where
                                    they may persuade you to read the full story.</p>

                                    While my mind is occupied with dangers and cautions, let me turn briefly to hypnotism.
                                    In the right hands, and with the appropriate rigorous precautions, it can be a very
                                    potent tool. In the wrong hands, and used for inappropriate purposes, it can cause
                                    serious harm to vulnerable minds.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over recent years, I have been acquainted with five individuals who practised "hypnotherapy".
                                    Three are practicing GPs; one, a friend, was well and formally trained; I cannot
                                    vouch for the training of the remaining one. Over time, and for various purposes,
                                    I have been hypnotised by two of the GPs and the fully trained layperson. I went
                                    to the last to see if she could help me to breathe in a more consistent way, particularly
                                    during periods of concentration, when breathing became very shallow.</p>
                                <p>
                                    My friend declined to do this, insisting that she would need to explore the reasons
                                    why I breathed in this manner. We live some distance apart, and regular sessions
                                    were not possible. However, as I was there, she said, would I like to experience
                                    her technique, in this case aimed solely at deep relaxation? Naturally, I agreed,
                                    particularly as I was keen to see how her method might differ from the two others
                                    that I had experienced.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I hypnotise easily, and soon reached the state immediately prior to full hypnosis.
                                    However, while in this state and while still in possession of my reason, I felt
                                    a very strong spiritual presence move into me, and I was still sufficiently aware
                                    to realise that if I had gone further, I could have been spoken through as if I
                                    were a spiritualist medium. I remained in that "half and half" state until the session
                                    ended. Which immediately introduces the possibility that many individuals may be
                                    entered by spiritual "intrusions" in a similar manner while under hypnosis. I remember
                                    well the comments of one of the GPs mentioned above, who, returning from a conference
                                    devoted to medical hypnotherapy, told me of the concern of one member who addressed
                                    the conference to warn them of just this possibility.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Look on the Internet and you will find many sites that offer training in hypnotherapy
                                    - the main emphasis appears to be that when "trained", there will be financial rewards
                                    aplenty. There are even sites that offer "training" that involves no actual contact
                                    between the trainer and trainee - everything is done on line or with tapes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As for "entertainment" hypnosis - well, the websites abound with promises of fame
                                    and fortune. No mention anywhere of the harm that might be caused in sen-sitive
                                    and vulnerable minds. Having been through procedures that might permanently have
                                    harmed my mind when undergoing the "dodgy" psychiatry that I mention earlier, I
                                    have no doubt that the mind is the most precious faculty, and that it should be
                                    protected from harm at all times. I agree completely with poet Sir Edward Dyer (1540-1607),
                                    when he writes:
                                </p>
                                <div class="centering-container">
                                    <div class="centered-element">
                                        <p>
                                            My mind to me a kingdom is,<br />
                                            Such present joys therein I find,<br />
                                            That it excels all other bliss<br />
                                            That earth affords or grows by kind.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                    As well as the dangers of spiritual intrusion incurred during hypnosis, Dr. Modi
                                    includes a further number of situations that make a sensitive person more vulnerable
                                    and accessible to intruding "entities". These include:</p>
                                <ul class="generic">

                                    <li>Emotional conditions, such as anger, fear, hate, depression, grief, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Drug and alcohol use.</li>
                                    <li>Constant and persistent "mind numbing" music.</li>

                                    <li>Voluntary possession or invitational possession such as:
                                        <ul class="generic-no-bullet">
                                            <li>Using Ouija board</li>
                                            <li>Using automatic writing</li>
                                            <li>Sitting in a s&eacute;ance</li>

                                            <li>Inviting a spirit to come on board voluntarily out of love. </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    This is far from being an exhaustive list, and I would most certainly add the dangers
                                    that might result from frequent and prolonged deep meditation that is indulged in
                                    without adequate guidance.

                                    Some individuals, for example, deliberately seek so-called siddhis - in Buddhist
                                    and ascetic Yoga philosophy, miraculous powers obtained especially through meditation
                                    and wisdom. In the cultures from which these practices come, postulants are trained
                                    by experienced elders. When such practices are lifted out of their cultural milieu,
                                    much may be left behind, and the rigour and control lost - often with dire consequences
                                    for the one seeking these powers.</p>

                                    By the very nature of her book, Dr Modi is forced to ignore the ever increasing
                                    number of routes into the susceptible mind that are being created and added to by
                                    modern technology. More and more people - young people in particular - are living
                                    large portions of their lives in a virtual world. Frequently, we are supplied with
                                    statistics telling us how many young people have TV, computer, playstation, MP3
                                    etc in their bedroom, and how much time they spend there away from parental oversight.

                                    one is real. The chat rooms are anonymous; everyone has an alias; the identity,
                                    age, sex and motives of the other participants are the anything or nothing that

                                    The young and gullible are groomed by older people and lured away from home. With
                                    webcams in many bedrooms, young girls, especially, are coaxed into self-exposure
                                    and as they get more confident, to perform "lewd acts". When they try to withdraw
                                    from this contact, they are threatened with further exposure to a wider - in fact,
                                    worldwide - audience, with what resulting personal distress, one can only guess.</p>

                                    I have deliberately used "lewd acts" to mirror its use in the Van Dusen quotation
                                    above. The ploy is identical. In the one instance, the evil is of spiritual origin
                                    into the mind of the patient: in the other, the evil derives from a human source,
                                    but is no less potent in the effect that it will have upon the vulnerable.

                                    A current survey reports that some teenagers get as little as four hours sleep each
                                    night. Sleep deprivation is a technique used in the psychological mind manipulation
                                    of prisoners, a technique that is used to corrupt their minds and brainwash them.
                                    Another survey, if it were done, would, I am sure, reveal the current generation
                                    as the most brainwashed ever.

                                    The combination of night time, lack of sleep and an open/empty mind is the most
                                    promising ever available for the spiritual intrusion - after all, these are the
                                    same conditions that the religious ascetic would use, except that he or she would
                                    have been made aware of the dangers of a mind that is wide open and uncontrolled.
                                    In his series of spiritual exercises, Saint Ignatius of Loyola includes much advice
                                    and many cautions aimed at the religious novice.

                                    by individuals for their own perverted pleasure and gratification. There are also
                                    the very subtle means of persuasion and ultimately domination, that may be concealed
                                    in an apparently informative and helpful website. Nine tenths of the output of the
                                    site is squeaky clean and full of verifiable information: the other tenth may have
                                    a purpose to persuade, almost subliminally.

                                    to the sites that subtly persuade a person to suicide - they all have mirrors in
                                    the subliminal persuasions exercised by the spiritual intruders into human minds.
                                    And I do not mean simply the minds of the sensitive and vulnerable, for so subtle
                                    can these ploys be, that they can be insinuated into the minds of those who would
                                    pooh-pooh the suggestion that they could be influenced.</p>

                                    the invisible highway for much that is evil. In a mega way, it has become for the
                                    whole world what the uncontrolled and unregulated mind has become for the individual.</p>

                                    another consequence of the electrical and electronic gear that surrounds individuals
                                    and their sensitive minds, brains and bodies. Apart from a few basic items, a bedroom
                                    should be an electricity-free haven. As the average bedroom is becoming less and
                                    less a haven, it becomes more and more an extension of the electrical jungle that
                                    is revealed in the quotation below that I have taken from The Body Electric by Robert
                                    O. Becker.

                                    I have acute personal sensitivity to my electrical and magnetic environment, and
                                    recognise in my own life much of what Becker writes. He is an orthopaedic surgeon,
                                    and while conducting research into the minute electrical currents that flow during
                                    the regeneration of bone following a fracture, he learned much concerning the total
                                    electrical nature of our bodies and minds. Additionally, he has studied the potential
                                    reactions that individuals might experience within their electrical surroundings.

                                        by their very natures as electrical centres, are jungles of interpenetrating fields
                                        and radiation that completely drown out the earth's background throb. Is this the
                                        underlying reason why so many of them have become jungles in another sense as well?
                                        Is this the partial explanation for the fact that the rate of suicide between the
                                        ages of fifteen and twenty-four rose from 5.1 per 100,000 in 1961, to 12.8 in 1981?
                                        Might this be an invisible and thus overlooked reason why so many governmental leaders,
                                        working at the centres of the most powerful electromagnetic networks, consistently

                                    to compare and contrast her approach with that of Dr Hunter. At a simple level,
                                    Dr Modi uses the terms "dissociation of the personality" and "multiple personality"
                                    interchangeably, as if their meaning was identical.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Dr Hunter obviously rejects the latter term and doggedly sticks to dissociation.
                                    It is possible that without actually saying so, she was rejecting the perception
                                    so "admirably" created in the earlier quotation taken from the Oxford Companion
                                    to the Mind -"... from after demoniacal possession had ceased to be a plausible,
                                    scientifically acceptable explanation of sudden, extraordinary changes in personality
                                    until the time at which psychoanalytical ideas began to have an impact."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Although Dr Modi frequently refers to "demons", she does so in the genre of her
                                    overall terminology, and certainly not in the pejorative sense in which I believe
                                    that it is used in the quotation above. To me, the use here of the term "demoniacal"
                                    shows intent to put any such concepts into the realms of the mediaeval church and
                                    outmoded beliefs and superstitions. A statement of intent, no less - namely that
                                    psychiatry was coming into its own, was rejecting the spiritual, and was claiming
                                    its territory. Anything "spiritual" was henceforth relegated to the religions: hereafter
                                    "the mind" would be the preserve of the secular, and of "psychiatry"!</p>
                                <p>
                                    Dr Hunter refers to "the professional jargon of ego states". She would describe
                                    the "ego states" to a patient as - "I am a different person sitting here in the
                                    office than at home, different as a wife than I am as a mother, different in the
                                    lecture hall than when I am enjoying myself with friends ..." Immediately I take
                                    issue with her, for what I perceive her to be describing are overlapping roles,
                                    not vastly different personalities within the same person.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I believe that it is a grave mistake for someone in Dr Hunter's situation even to
                                    think of relating one's own personal experience and perceptions to those of the
                                    patient. I remember well a TV film called "Voices in my Head". Although I had had
                                    discussions beforehand with the producer, and had some idea of the form that it
                                    would take, I was completely unprepared for the attitude of some of the professionals
                                    who took part. One, in particular, enraged me when he tried to liken the inner voices
                                    of voice-hearers to the sort of inner ruminative conversations that he might have
                                    when mentally teasing at a problem.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I found it to be quite unbelievable that someone introduced as an "expert" should
                                    have so little understanding of the actuality of the inner torments and terrors
                                    of many voice hearers. In my article entitled "Two Fools", (I was not referring
                                    to him, although the term might have applied), I introduced the reader to Ruth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One dominating voice in her mind demanded that, to eradicate the wickedness that
                                    "God" perceived in her, she must jump into the river and die. The voice that took
                                    over when she was in the water and guided her to safety, was calm and supportive,
                                    and helped her to survive. Perhaps the professor in the film would argue that she
                                    was only having a ruminative conversation in her mind, though perhaps even he might
                                    have had difficulty explaining to a friend of both myself and Ruth, why Ruth should
                                    arrive at her door, semi-naked and covered in mud as the result of this rumination!

                                    In the miscellaneous articles that I include in Chapter 16 of my book, one, entitled
                                    "J's Story", refers to a very mild lady of my acquaintance who has lived with "voices"
                                    for all of her adult life. But even she was "spitting feathers" at this travesty
                                    of a presentation, and the lack of understanding by the producer and his chosen
                                    experts, of the actual experiences of voice-hearers.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Dr Hunter is undoubtedly a caring and dedicated doctor, and her concerns for patients
                                    and their associated family and friends are revealed frequently in the book. However,
                                    she appears to be obsessed with ego states and dissociation to the exclusion of
                                    many of the possible alternatives that might apply.

                                    In an oblique way, she takes me back a long time, to a wind-up gramophone that we
                                    enjoyed in my youthful home. Not for her repetitiveness, but for the recollection
                                    of a particular record that was played from time to time. Called The Parson's Christmas
                                    Address, the speaker proceeded in unctuous tones to deliver an amusing sermon. At
                                    one stage he introduced us to:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>

                                        "... a Curate with one eye named Johnson - I don't know the name of his other eye.
                                        Sunday after Sunday, he preached and held forth on the subject of infant baptism,
                                        until the people were exceedingly fed up, and complained to me. And so I told Johnson,
                                        who was abashed at the thought that he had so bored the congregation; and he said
                                        to me 'Give me a text, Vicar', and so I gave him one - 'Thou art the man.' The following
                                        Sunday, we all waited for the sermon in hope and with bated breath, as Johnson ascended
                                        into the pulpit, and began 'Thou art the man! Before this man was a man, he was
                                        a youth ... and before he was a youth, he was a baby. Which brings me back to infant

                                    I hear echoes from that gramophone of the past, as Dr Hunter inevitably "brings
                                    us back to multiple ego states, and dissociation." When discussing the patient who
                                    has a very thick file acquired over many consultations, and who has no conclusive
                                    diagnosis, she writes "From the family physician's perspective, there are some clues
                                    that may alert you to the possibility that your confusing patient may be dissociative.
                                    Some of these are" - she then lists 54 different symptoms and syndromes, and concludes
                                    - "in other words, practically everything." And a little further on "... although
                                    it seems incomprehensible to us who work in the field, there are many detractors
                                    who assert that there is no such thing as a dissociative disorder, that they are
                                    a figment of the therapist's imagination ..."</p>
                                <p>
                                    Undoubtedly, Dr Hunter is doing her best to be thorough and to inform the professional
                                    readers, but her obsessive "dissociation with everything" approach is that of a
                                    scatter gun - and many innocent bystanders may get hit by the widely dispersed shot.
                                    One of the "bystanders" is Elizabeth, and her inclusion as a target angered her
                                    - as it does me on her behalf. Although, when she read that earlier I had written
                                    "very, very angry", she suggested that I should moderate it, and explain that her
                                    chief reaction was that she felt persecuted. Yes, persecuted!</p>
                                <p>
                                    Elizabeth is now thirty, and in that comparatively short life, she has been poked
                                    at and prodded, analysed and categorised by many people, and in so many different
                                    ways. Apart from acquiring a thick record file, she has been allocated almost as
                                    many diagnoses as "Joanna", who was the subject of Dr Mackarness' review earlier.

                                <p>
                                    So why "dissociation"? Possibly the diagnosis of last resort? "I don't know what
                                    is wrong with you, and I don't know how to treat you" declared the psychiatrist
                                    at her last "group conference". Picture the scene - psychiatrist, psychologist,
                                    psychiatric social worker, and the three members of the crisis team - enough to
                                    make anyone feel cowed and inarticulate - "and then one of the crisis team laughed".
                                    That evening on the phone, Elizabeth described her humiliation through her tears
                                    - and there were tears in my eyes as well.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Now, if Dr hunter should take charge - OH MY GOD!!!!! - a dissociated mother with
                                    a young child!!!! Call out the Cavalry and the National Guard. Hold the front page!!!

                                    It would appear that almost anything out of the ordinary that develops in the life
                                    or behaviour of the child, may be (most probably is) suspicious and must be investigated
                                    as possible evidence of child abuse. The abuse may derive from one of the ego states
                                    acting independently, and outside the cognisance and memory of the mother in her
                                    normal state. So you Watchers - the teacher, the school nurse, the GP - be alert
                                    to unexplained injuries; reluctance to divulge information; perfectionism; behaviour
                                    problems e.g. bullying; difficulty making/keeping friends; urinary problems (congruent
                                    with age); unexplained abdominal pains.</p>

                                    The last two made me sit up - "Dysuria, chronic urinary infections, enuresis beyond
                                    normal age limits (i.e. after age 10), hematuria, vulvitis, vaginal discharge and
                                    other distress related to uncomfortable urinary, penile or vulvovaginal function
                                    - all demand to be investigated... Of course, one's mind immediately turns to abuse..."
                                    "Virtually everything I have said about urinary problems applies to unexplained
                                    abdominal pain. Children do not normally have recurrent or chronic abdominal pain,
                                    so the appropriate investigations, again, are mandatory... Usually the source of
                                    the pain is one or both of two things: intense fear, e.g. of physical abuse, and
                                    sexual abuse."

                                    While looking for yet another book to quote at you, I came across one that has languished
                                    on the shelf since an earlier "crisis" of child protection gripped the country,
                                    and witch-hunts really did take place. The book is <i>Chasing Satan</i> by Dianne
                                    Core, and was one of the source books for anyone who was concerned about satanic
                                    ritual abuse. Do you remember the time? Here from the Internet is an extract from
                                    an article that illustrates the semi-hysteria that swept whole communities.

                                        of such fantasies was illustrated in 1980 with the publication in the United States
                                        of a book containing a very unusual case history.

                                        "In Michelle Remembers, the patient Michelle Smith, writing with the help of her
                                        Canadian psychiatrist Dr Lawrence Pazder (whom she eventually married), gives a
                                        vivid account of how she was supposedly imprisoned during her childhood by a satanic
                                        cult. The members of the cult supposedly tortured her, forced her to defecate on
                                        a crucifix, raped and sodomised her with candles, butchered still-born babies in
                                        front of her and imprisoned her naked in a snake-filled cage. After a year of captivity,
                                        her Christian faith eventually triumphed over the power of Satan and she was allowed
                                        to return home. She is then supposed to have entirely repressed the memory of her
                                        ordeal until she entered therapy with Dr Pazder more than twenty years later. The
                                        book that they wrote together almost immediately became a bestseller.</p>

                                        "Partly because its sexual and sado-masochistic content was masked by its holy intentions,
                                        Michelle Remembers appealed powerfully both to evangelical Christians who were anxious
                                        about the revival of Satanism, and to what might be termed "sleeping Christians"
                                        within the caring professions. It also appealed to therapists who believed that
                                        it was possible to repress the memories of horrific sexual assaults. As Pazder's
                                        ideas gradually coalesced with general anxieties about religious cults and sexual
                                        abuse, the notion of a large-scale conspiracy to abuse children began to seem plausible."

                                    Having been allocated the label of "dissociation", Elizabeth appears to have acquired
                                    all of the baggage that goes with it, including the feeling of being "spied" upon.
                                    Her daughter has been getting "special attention" at school, and she is being quizzed
                                    in a way that is intrusive into Elizabeth's personal and private life. I know that
                                    those involved will doubtless feel that they have a duty of care to little Sally,
                                    but the prime duty of care should be towards Elizabeth, and openly to support her
                                    in providing a secure and stable environment for Sally.

                                    Elizabeth's care of Sally is exemplary, and the child is bright, outgoing and advanced
                                    for her nearly seven years. A friend who is a head of department at a local secondary
                                    school, and who has spent some time with her, later saw a piece that Sally had written.
                                    She commented that some kids leaving school at sixteen could not write so legibly,
                                    or with such fluent meaning as this seven year old.</p>

                                    Why do I keep going on about Elizabeth? Well, she is what it's all about, isn't
                                    she? This entire mega-billion pound edifice that is the mental health industry is
                                    for her benefit, isn't it?
                                </p>

                                    Well, you could believe that it is for the benefit of the major multi-national pharmaceutical
                                    companies and their shareholders, companies that sponsor much research and that
                                    bombard hard-worked GPs with masses of persuasive literature and almost force them
                                    to over-diagnose conditions such as depression, as one recent report suggests. Companies
                                    that supply drugs that create unwelcome - some potentially fatal - conditions in
                                    patients. Drugs that require informed consent from patient or guardian - consent
                                    that is hardly if ever sought.
                                </p>

                                    You could believe that it is to fund faculties of "academic" psychiatry - which,
                                    on the face of it, could be light years away from Elizabeth and the everyday realities
                                    of her life. You could believe that it is to fund psychiatry that can provide a
                                    patient with twelve different diagnoses - and still not get a correct one. And on
                                    and on, and seemingly having no relevance to her, and the prime needs of her life
                                    as a mother who is desperate to work, and to be able to support herself and her
                                    child. "Who would employ you?", said the woman at the department set up to help
                                    people back into work. She would dearly like to get appropriate training - she has
                                    successfully completed an Access course, but cannot go forward.</p>
                                <p>
                                    She is one of the thousands of individuals for whom "the system" exists. Yes, individuals,
                                    for some of whom "the system" does not seem able to cater. At this time, Elizabeth's
                                    needs are that people should get of her back, and give her really active support
                                    - support that she herself chooses, not what others deem appropriate. Each person
                                    has needs that are unique to him- or herself - they are not part of a uniform herd.
                                    Elizabeth persuaded me to break the habit of a lifetime, and watch a "soap". "Eastenders",
                                    and a new character - Len Harker. He sits talking to one of the regulars on a bench
                                    somewhere on the South Downs, philosophising as only in "soaps".</p>
                                <p>
                                    "Look", he says, "you wouldn't know it to look at me, but I've got two degrees."
                                    - "Completely useless" he says. "Wotcher mean?" She says. "Sociology and psychology
                                    - completely useless. I can tick the boxes, plot the graphs, analyse the statistics,
                                    crunch the numbers - and then what?" " I still don't follow" she says. "I'll tell
                                    you what," he says, "none of it applies to me - I'm an individual - yes, an individual,
                                    not a graph, tick box or a load of statistics!"</p>

                                    Anyone who has read much of the rest of my writing may possibly be fed up with me
                                    re-peating the same mantra. Individual; individual. It was one of the main themes
                                    of an article that I wrote, entitled "I don't believe it". Here is a small extract
                                    taken from the part where I discuss the conclusions of a study of 50,000 Swedish
                                    conscripts made over ten years; a study that investigated the connection, if any,
                                    between their use of cannabis and any onset of psychosis.</p>
                                <p>
                                    "Returning to the Swedish research into cannabis use among 50,000 conscripts over
                                    ten years, un-doubtedly much valuable information has been identified. However,
                                    even though large numbers are involved in this and other studies, I am still perturbed
                                    that the results will be applied generally and in all cases. In my thinking, the
                                    results can only be extrapolated if one assumes 50,000 clones. But people are not
                                    clones of each other, and should be dealt with as the individuals that they are
                                    - as individual as their fingerprints or DNA.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Here is a portion of a photograph of the ship's company of a destroyer in which
                                    I served in 1946:</p>

                                    There are approximately 25 men dressed as seamen. Clones? They all wear the same
                                    uniform, but even their caps are different - different angle and individual tying
                                    and placing of the bow on the cap ribbon, for example. Different? Individual? Of
                                    course they are. Some were Regulars, others "Hostilities Only". I can see two who,
                                    as orphans of seafarers, had been brought up in the "Arethusa" tradition and had
                                    entered the Navy as boy seamen; two others who came from top public schools. Some
                                    for whom a "run ashore" meant visits to the many bars "down the Gut" in Malta, and
                                    others for whom it meant time spent at "Aggie's" - the Mission to Seamen - and a
                                    cup of tea. There is even one man whom I never saw go ashore.</p>
                                <p>
                                    There are men in the picture who had soon acquired the naval jargon or had it ingrained
                                    after many years at sea, for whom "avast" and "belay" still had meaning; who knew
                                    what to do with soojie-moojie, baggywrinkle or a pusser's dip. Men, if they were
                                    cloned at all, would find it in their surnames - "Hooky" Walker, "Bungey" Williams,
                                    "Pincher" Martin, "Lonesome" Rhodes, "Shiner" Wright, "Tug" Wilson, "Dusty" Miller,
                                    "Dolly" Grey, "Spud" Murphy - and so on. I appear in an-other part of the photograph,
                                    but like every Welshman, I was "Taff", while every Cornishman was "Jan". There are
                                    able-seamen and gunners, torpedo-men and stokers, telegraphists and "bunting tossers"
                                    or signalmen. You can decide for yourselves which would be "Lofty" and which "Shortarse".</p>
                                <p>
                                    There are 25 truly individual men. Multiply that group by 2,000 and you can see
                                    the possible range contained in the 50,000 individuals of the Swedish study into
                                    the effects upon mental health of smoking cannabis, and the impossibility of applying
                                    the results to all voice hearers.

                                    Yet, ironically, all that the Swedes had to do to find a connection between cannabis
                                    and "schizophrenia" was to turn their eyes to the north, to their own indigenous
                                    people - the Sami. As with many indigenous peoples worldwide, the Sami had their
                                    culture that went back far in time, and in that culture was the Shaman. The Shaman
                                    was the link with the world of spirit and used a locally available hypnotic - mushroom,
                                    cannabis, mescaline/peyote - to induce an inner state that made him open and receptive
                                    to his spiritual 'other'..."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, in my search for the individual, in my demand that every mental health
                                    patient should be seen as such, and not just in relation to the label that has been
                                    allocated, I realise that the "individual", in many instances, may become just a
                                    cipher in the great mental health edifice, about which I wrote earlier. When you
                                    consider all of the people in suits and white coats in offices, con-sulting rooms,
                                    laboratories, university departments, in the great pharmaceutical enterprises -
                                    they all draw their salaries, have worthwhile careers on the back of the unfortunate
                                    "nutter".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yes, that is how the individual might be seen - and seen through a telescope held
                                    back to front - as this nuisance on two legs might appear in the perception of some.
                                    There is a fair chance that you will have beheld Jasper Carrott holding forth in
                                    one of his one-man shows. Here he is on the top deck of a bus, an empty seat beside
                                    him - "And then up the stairs comes this nutter" - sound of a cretin advancing -
                                    "And of course, you know it - he's going to sit by you!" Next, the sound of a cretin
                                    opening a conversation, accompanied by great guffaws from the audience. And so on.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Just imagine if Carrott had said "this cripple", "this blind geezer", "this Jew",
                                    "this Muslim", "this pouf"... the possibilities are endless, and all would have
                                    drawn instant condemnation from all quarters. So why is the nutter fair game?</p>

                                    The sound of the laughter says it all - indicates the attitude of many to what they
                                    do not understand. Don't know how to reach out - in fact the reverse - desperately
                                    want to avoid. Many individuals have the same problem relating to anyone suffering
                                    from a serious illness - don't know what to say; will do almost anything to avoid
                                    having to talk. There was a man who used to come to my house for help in coping
                                    with his cancer, and who exemplifies what I am saying. He was a member of several
                                    Masonic Lodges, yet to his immense chagrin, the only brothers who showed any concern
                                    for him were those whose duty it was to do so. Others just avoided him altogether.</p>

                                    problems, who nevertheless show indifference, or even contempt. Elizabeth wrote

                                    Elizabeth has become a sort of "anchorwoman" for a number of friends who have similar
                                    difficulties, and they exchange mutual support. It has opened my eyes since getting

                                    because it was cold, she sent her daughter to school wearing "leggings" under her
                                    dress - to be met with the proposition that she was doing so to hide bruising on
                                    her legs. There was no bruising, but so great is the perception that disturbed mothers
                                    abuse their children, that they appear to be under suspicion at every whipstitch.</p>

                                        the op-portunities to observe and try to understand, people from a vast range of
                                        cultures - people whom one saw previously, if one saw them at all, as 'performers'
                                        in documentaries or devised programmes, and subject to the presentation and interpretation
                                        of the programmes' compilers. Now I can watch them completely untainted by the intervening
                                        'editor interpreter'. I watch them in their own dramas, chat shows, news bulletins
                                        and a variety of presentations and versions of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'

                                        the two operative words, for apart from sensing the general mood of the piece I
                                        have not the slightest idea of what is being said. When I watch Chinese television
                                        there are subtitles - but they also are in Chinese. I would dearly like to know

                                        because it appears to be serious and intelligent, but apart from words that sound
                                        vaguely like 'Iraq' and 'Arabia', there is nothing to guide me. Worse still is a
                                        news bulletin when the person being interviewed is speaking English, but is then
                                        being talked over and the screen has rolling subtitles all in Arabic.</p>

                                        outside them, they see people, faces expressions, actions, moods and reactions,
