									Even though more than half a century has passed, those words still come to my thoughts
									as I view in my minds eye the scene that used to greet me as I came up on deck each
									morning. Our ship was ploughing its slow and straight furrow parallel with, and
									a few miles off, the very shore upon which the psalmist author may have trod so
									many years ago. It was quite early, 5 a.m., for we were working "tropical routine",
									and for a day-man (or "idler" as the Naval parlance has it), the day began at that
									hour. The iron main deck and the entire superstructure were awash and dripping with
									dew from the cool of the night, while the shore was a line of opalescent shadow
									to the east, back-lit by the near-to-rising sun.</p>
								<p>
									Many writers, both ancient and modern, have tried to describe the colour and placidity
									of those eastern Mediterranean seas with greater or less success, as I used to try
									in my letters to my girl friend at home. Nothing disturbed the surface, other than
									the long line of our wake connecting us astern to the far horizon. And then there
									they were - the "Wings of the Morning" - the caiques and coasting schooners, sails
									full set but hanging still, with no breath to fill them, but somehow "ghosting"
									along and waiting for the morning breeze.</p>
								<p>
									In the moments as I watched, the sun broke free of the land and even at that hour
									it burned. The dew vanished at a touch and the sails took on a brilliance as the
									light enveloped them - and the day's work began. How long it seemed, confined in
									the small radar cabins as I did my maintenance checks, until blessed noon when work
									ceased for all but the duty watch and the hands were piped to swim. The ship slowed,
									the whaler was lowered, and we dived so eagerly from the ship's side and into the
									cool depths.</p>
								<p>
									What contrasts life throws at us, for within six months I was in an aircraft carrier
									battling its way around Britain in January storms of probably the worst winter of
									the twentieth century. The mountains of the Isle of Arran were snow-laden as we
									sought shelter within its lee and behind Holy Island, and icy were the winds as
									we then made our way past Cape Wrath and John o' Groats and finally to the Forth.
									But in spite of, or because of their contrasts, I have never lost my fascination
									with the seas nor my desire to be close to or on them.</p>
								<p>
									As I stand on my near-by shore as I often do, the expanse of the sand and the vastness
									of the dunes trigger memories of seemingly never ending sunny days on a similar
									shore where I grew up in South Wales - of fires of driftwood and smoky tea, and
									the long weary trudge home at night. And the high tides and gales of the autumn
									equinox bring back clear memories of my mother and her love of the driving spray
									on the rocks on probably our last outing of the year.</p>
								<p>
									I wrote earlier of this attraction that water has for me and of the feast for the
									imagination with which I have been provided for virtually all of my life. There
									must be many individuals who, like me, can just gaze out to the horizon for seemingly
									endless time - and what do <i>you</i> see? In reality or in your own mind's eye
									or your own imagination? Do you look for, or even see, Tir Nan Og? <span class="note">[the Celtic Otherworld]</span> Do you believe
									in the past existence of Atlantis, and do you give credence to the tales deriving
									from the alleged reincarnates from that mythical/real land? And do you gaze horizon-ward
									in the hope that some day Atlantis will re-emerge from the depths where "of its
									bones are corals made"?

									Can I ask you to put aside what you see, or imagine or hope for, and instead to
									join me on the self-same edge of the ocean, there to contemplate the real magic,
									the magic of the reality of our origins? Through the medium of television, and taking
									advantage of the courage and resource of undersea explorers in their minute bathyspheres,
									we can descend in mid-ocean to the bottom several kilometres below, and there see
									the origins of the tectonic plates of the continents and some of the substances
									of life itself. In particular, I want you to look at a "black smoker". ("Oh dear"
									said Alice to herself, nearly scared out of her wits at the thought of a Black Smoker.
									The only Smoker she could think of was Grimes the gardener, and he frightened her
									sometimes as he puffed continuously at a huge pipe stuffed with coarse twist, pouring
									out clouds of smoke which merged with that from the bonfire he was tending. "Now
									he always looks very <i>dark</i>" she said to herself, "but no, he grows such nice
									flowers, it can't be him ..." - and Alice went and hid herself just in case the
									real Black Smoker came along...).
								</p>
								<p>
									No, the reality of a black smoker as it pours out its gases from the core of the
									earth is, in itself, awesome to contemplate, for here in its turbulence are some
									of the materials of which we are made and, indirectly, are the source of life as
									we know it. In particular, I want you to see the sulphur, for in its way it is so
									vital to our very origin and continued existence. Without the sulphur it is doubtful
									whether we would have rain. </p>
								<p>
									Back on the surface, and, could you see them, myriads of algae that continue the
									process originating in the earth's bowels, taking the sulphur and converting it
									into an organic and gaseous form, that then disperses freely into the atmosphere.
									And it is around the molecules of this gas that the moisture evaporated from the
									seas forms into droplets, into clouds and eventually rain. Without the algae and
									the sulphur - no clouds, no rain; no rain, no erosion of rock to make soil; no soil,
									no plants; no plants, no us.
								</p>
								<p>
									But the algae have other mysteries that have long puzzled biologists. Why are they
									equipped with anti-freeze? At last, and a paradox only recently explained. The algae
									need sunshine to survive and proliferate - but they create clouds don't they, so
									isn't that counterproductive, life-threatening even, for sun-loving algae? But the
									clouds create storms and storms cause algae to be sucked up and carried to extreme
									heights where they might freeze to death - if it wasn't for the anti-freeze; and
									thus they are dispersed to other seas, other oceans. One of those incredible marvels
									of evolution, or a fantastic attention to detail of a prescient Creator, whichever
									you will.
								</p>
								<p>
									In your imagination, can I take you even below the black smokers? The molten magma
									is oozing in mid-ocean, pouring through these gaps in the earth's crust, forming
									new edges to the tectonic plates, forcing them apart and under continents, creating
									the tremors and pustules on the earth's skin - the earthquakes and volcanoes. But
									even deeper, towards the centre of the earth, to the molten iron core. Without it
									you would never have been even a gleam in your father's eye. Without it life on
									earth would just not exist in the form that we know.</p>
								<p>
									Thermal movement of the iron within the core effectively creates a magnet with two
									ends or "poles" that we call north and south. The magnet in turn creates a magnetic
									field that, effectively, is our shield. The sun pours out the "solar wind" in constant
									stream - a never-ending flow of electrically charged particles. Our magnetic shield
									diverts them, and mostly they flow harmlessly past. Without our shield, the planet
									would be "scoured" by these particles and would be completely barren, as are the
									other planets that have no iron core. The particles of the solar wind arrive into
									our upper atmosphere at the poles, and create the magnificent displays of the auroras,
									while during peaks of sunspot activity they reach parts of the earth in quantity,
									disrupting electronic communication, and subtly altering the behaviour of sensitive
									people.</p>
								<p>
									Take out a magnetic compass and unerringly the needle points to the north. Turn
									it on its edge and it will point down into the ground at an angle that depends where
									on the earth's surface you are - at my latitude it makes an angle of roughly 80
									degrees with the horizontal; elsewhere it will be different. What it shows you is
									that always, everywhere, there is a magnetic field - a component of our evolution.
									But more than that, and unless you have special equipment you cannot see, it pulses
									with incredible regularity. There are various subtle low energies at frequencies
									of roughly one to twenty-five beats per second, but the prime one, and that linked
									by most researchers to the process of evolution and continued planetary life, pulses
									at 10 hertz (or cycles per second). It is part of the body clock that if it stops
									ticking or ticks to a different frequency can cause illness or even death in some
									organisms.</p>
								<p>
									I have led you to contemplate, and I hope understand, just a minute few of the many
									elements that have been involved in the development and continued evolution of our
									lives and the other forms of life on the planet. Elements that are all pervasive
									and yet invisible - undetectable to the majority of us - yet without them we would
									become ill or die. But die we must - and what then?
								</p>
								<p>
									Can we stay here on our lovely open shore without the noise, clutter and pollution
									of everyday life, and read or listen to some thoughts from a delightful book by
									Irish philosopher and poet John O'Donohue? I first heard them over the phone from
									a friend upon whom they had made an instant impression. Going into the local library
									later the same day, the first book upon which my eyes lighted was this self-same
									<i>Anam Cara - Spiritual Wisdom from the Celtic World</i> - and so naturally I brought
									it home to read, for my friend was quite firm when she said that it would be a long
									time before she loaned her copy, so entranced was she with what the book had to
									say.
								</p>
								<p>
									John O'Donohue queries whether space and time are different in the eternal world,
									and writes:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"Time always separates us ... Time is primarily linear, disjointed and fragmented.
										All of your past days have disappeared; they have vanished. The future has not come
										to you yet. All you have is the little stepping-stone of the present moment.
									</p>
									<p>
										"When the soul leaves the body, it is no longer under the burden of space and time.
										The soul is free; distance and separation hinder it no more. The dead are our nearest
										neighbours; they are all around us. Meister Eckhart was once asked, where does the
										soul of a person go when the person dies? He said, no place. Where else would the
										soul be going? Where else is the eternal world? It can be nowhere other than here.
									</p>
									<p>
										"We have falsely spatialized the eternal world. We have driven the eternal out into
										some distant galaxy. Yet the eternal world does not seem to be a place but rather
										a different state of being. The soul of the person goes no place because there is
										no place else to go. This suggests that the dead are here with us, in the air that
										we are moving through all the time. The only difference between us and the dead
										is that they are now in invisible form. You cannot see them with the human eye.
										But you can sense the presence of those you love who have died. With the refinement
										of your soul, you can sense them. You feel that they are near.</p>
									<p>
										"My father used to tell us a story about a neighbour who was very friendly with
										the local priest. There is a whole mythology in Ireland about Druids and priests
										having special powers. But this man and the priest used to go for long walks. One
										day the man said to the priest, where are the dead? The priest told him not to ask
										questions like that. But the man persisted and finally, the priest said, "I will
										show you; but you are never to tell anyone." Needless to say, the man did not keep
										his word. The priest raised his right arm, the man looked out under the raised right
										hand, and saw the souls of the departed everywhere all around as thick as the dew
										on blades of grass.</p>
									<p>
										"Often our loneliness and isolation is due to a failure of spiritual imagination.
										We forget that there is no such thing as empty space. All space is full of presence,
										particularly the presence of those who are now in eternal, invisible form."
									</p>

									Lovely, and in some ways, comforting images. Perhaps an over-simplification. Doubtless,
									everyone reading this will have some view or belief of "life after death". Some
									will have beliefs shaped by their own experience; others will have entrenched views
									laid down within the unshakable dogma of their religion - sometimes comforting,
									sometimes frightening.
								</p>
								<p>
									Yet others will totally deny, and refuse even to contemplate, the possibility of
									continuing into a spiritual state. If you are one of the latter, yet nevertheless
									continuing to read of my actual experiences, I am at a total loss to know what,
									if anything, I can write to convince you, although truly, I can no longer concern
									myself whether I do or not.
								</p>
								<p>
									Perhaps, consciously or unconsciously, there is the unspoken belief that in acknowledging
									the existence of a spiritual state of being, you have to take on board all of the
									paraphernalia of a religion. A horror that you would have to go to some place of
									worship; that your life would be constrained by thoughts of "sin" and "damnation".
									You may look at all of the human misery and turmoil, disputes and wars fought in
									the "name" of religion - stoked by concepts of "promised lands" or minute differences
									of textual interpretation - and curse all religions.</p>
								<p>
									Believe me, you can accept the reality of the existence of a state of spiritual
									being without even remotely embracing any religion, or altering your way of life.
									But more important, much more important than your own enlightenment, you could use
									the knowledge and understanding so gained to achieve what I am so desperately trying
									to get you to achieve - the release from torment of people who are plagued by intrusive
									spirits.</p>
								<p>
									Sometime, on a clear night, go out of doors, look at the stars, and reflect on what
									you can see. With your eyes or with the addition of your telescope, they are all
									there for you. They mean what you want them to mean. You do not have to be an astronomer
									to appreciate them, even to understand much of what you see. Although such devices
									as the Hubble telescope bring us wonders of vision, what you see is out of reach,
									out of touch. Some will look at, for instance, the Pleiades and imagine communication
									with Ascended Masters. Others will look for their future, and accept the predictions
									of astrologers who will interpret the "signs". Look at Orion and Sirius and reflect
									that, so we are told, the rulers of Ancient Egypt attempted a physical/spiritual
									union with these stars and that the Ghiza pyramids represent on earth a model of
									the constellation. </p>
								<p>
									In like wise, people try to give you a view of religion, of spiritual interaction
									- but reflect further, the only people who can tell you what it is like to walk
									on the moon, to travel and walk in space, are the people who have actually been
									there. So look at the stars, look at the planets, "examine" the world of "spirit";
									take your own view of them all - but also remember that there are individuals who
									have had a different "real" experience. Maybe they have something to tell you.
								</p>
								<p>
									And before we leave the stars, reflect also that the light from the nearest star
									had already started upon its journey to you long before the first human, homo sapiens,
									had taken a single step upon this planet. Yet here you are, at the very forefront,
									the cutting edge of evolution; the very latest model. What do you make of yourself?
									My oft quoted Paracelsus could never have known how immense are the distances to
									the stars, but he, like us, must have looked; imagined; dreamed - and as he dreamed,
									so he wrote:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"... the human body is vapour materialised by sunshine mixed with the life of the
										stars."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									Poetic? Mystical? Or very near the truth in the language and thought of his time?
									What do you think? Every atom of the material that makes up your body was there
									in existence when the stars were formed. Over millennia upon millennia they have
									been transmuted many times before they were assembled around the nucleus, the egg
									and sperm, that became you. Take the sulphur which inhabits every cell that forms
									your body; changed into organic form by the algae it is dissolved in the rain, and,
									on falling to earth, is taken up by plants that you eat, or by the animals that
									eat the plants that at second hand you eat - all the way from a black smoker. The
									calcium, so necessary for your bones and teeth, might derive from chalk or limestone
									- the compacted remains of myriads of tiny crustaceans, worms, algae, deposited
									in the seas over aeons. And virtually all dependent upon the action of the sun.</p>
								<p>
									Evolution or Creation? It is not for me to decide for you. The records of the rocks
									show the remains of tiny mammals already in existence in parallel with the dinosaurs,
									which latter seem to engage the imagination of so many people. Is the source of
									the fascination the fact that they were extinguished sixty-odd million years ago
									and that people can let their imaginations rip, or be terrorised by someone else's
									imagination in Jurassic film epics? Is it because <i>big</i> is exciting? </p>
								<p>
									Twentieth century thinker Schumacher told us "Small is beautiful", and there is
									something exquisite in the thought that, over the last sixty million years or so,
									that little fossilised mouse-like creature has developed into us. Species living
									in a coherent environment have little cause to change or develop - they are suited
									to their food or environment. But change causes change, adaptation and development
									and survival - always with the main imperatives of self-preservation, procreation
									and enhancement of the species. All imperatives that still reside within us. Our
									problem is that we have an intellect.
								</p>
								<p>
									Fossil remains from over two million years ago show a transition from quadruped
									to hominid; from <i>homo erectus</i> and <i>homo habilis</i> to homo sapiens and
									<i>neanderthalis</i>, namely us, and our recently extinct collaterals. Did they
									die out, were they exterminated by our ancestors, these Neanderthal peoples, or
									did they and we merge, interbreed and become one strand? If only we could find out,
									we might derive some clues for the future destiny of the human race - after all,
									Neanderthals were around for 150,000 years, far longer than <i>sapiens</i> has yet
									existed.
								</p>
								<p>This is not a hypothetical, nor an allegorical question. Analysis tells
									us that they were eminently adaptable, as we humans appear to be. They adapted to
									changes that natural phenomena imposed upon them - climate changes, ice ages and
									the like. Will we equally adapt to the changes that we ourselves are imposing upon
									ourselves? Or will we drive ourselves to extinction? We are already doing a very
									efficient job of preparing ourselves for the latter fate. I do not mean by war,
									although we, with modern technology, can manage to eliminate considerable quantities
									of people at a stroke.</p>
								<p>
									No: what I am getting at is that we are becoming very efficient at making ourselves
									ill. For as long as people have lived in societies there have been social diseases,
									the products of malnutrition, poor dwelling conditions, poor hygiene; but enlightenment
									and resource have eliminated many of these. (I am writing essentially about the
									"developed" world - much has to be done to eliminate disease from the less developed
									people; a moral issue too vast for my consideration here). </p>
								<p>
									The diseases and illnesses that we are bringing on ourselves are those resulting
									from affluence and technology; diseases that are both physical and mental. But,
									perhaps with more and increasing relevance, we are imposing upon ourselves and others
									a range of traumas that result from ignorance of, or a refusal to acknowledge, the
									existence of a "spirit" within each of us. And beyond that, a refusal on the part
									of many to acknowledge the existence of intelligent and independently acting spiritual
									"beings".</p>
								<p>
									I have often wondered, and continue to wonder, how and when the concept of "spirit",
									of an "otherness", arose in the minds of developing humanity. To some, and particularly
									acknowledging that the spirit is always represented as "speaking", it may presuppose
									the existence of a language in the culture of the "hearer". But this need not necessarily
									be so, for my experience has shown me that very potent communication can be established
									subliminally by the creation of ideas, concepts, feelings and moods, rather than
									by statements or instructions spelled out in actual words.
								</p>
								<p>
									As I have written earlier, in every part of the world and in every culture that
									has ever left a record throughout history, there has been an acknowledgement of
									a spiritual dimension and of the reality of invisible and independently acting spirits.
									It has also been perceived and acknowledged that within this dimension there is
									a source of knowledge and wisdom that far surpasses the knowledge and wisdom that
									may be developing as the result of natural observation and experiment. And knowledge
									and wisdom have always been represented as coming from the "supreme divine", who,
									it was always believed, had the power to impose sanctions in the event of non-compliance
									with the divine advice or instruction which had become enshrined in religion and
									religious dogma.</p>
								<p>
									Likewise, in each of these cultures, the <i>obverse</i> of the benevolent source
									of divine wisdom and protection has been acknowledged - namely the universal presence
									and action of spiritual <i>malevolence</i>. It is a source that appears to have
									in equal measure to the divine, knowledge and a perverted wisdom that are used to
									intrude into the minds, bodies and lives of sensitive and vulnerable individuals;
									intrusions that can encourage people into an actual <i>practice</i> of evil themselves,
									or which can undermine the mental and physical functioning of a person and lead
									to mental or physical illness, or both.</p>
								<p>
									As I write, it is now twenty-three years since I began to experience the reality
									of what hitherto might have been speculation - the actuality of a spiritual state
									of existence, and the ability of spiritual "entities" to influence the minds and
									bodies of humans. At this point, you might find it worthwhile to re-read the earlier
									section where I described the manner in which I first experienced intrusion into
									my mind and body. </p>
								<p>
									Nothing that has occurred during the intervening years has done anything to change
									my understanding of those events. On the contrary, everything that has happened
									to me since, all my experiences, have reinforced my certainty. <i>Every day</i>,
									in a variety of ways, I am reminded (<i>as if I needed reminding</i>) of the presence
									of the intruders. Gone, however, are the gross, obviously malignant, presences.
									No domination: no threats: no obscenities or salacious introductions into my mind.
									Everything that happens is at a more subtle level, almost unnoticed - would indeed
									pass unnoticed, if I had not gained an awareness of the whole process.

									Let us hark back together to what I wrote earlier, to the thoughts of two men who
									have experienced the spiritual in life - <i>used</i> the spiritual: <i>invoked</i>
									the spiritual: <i>worked</i> with the spiritual. Men with such widely different
									backgrounds and antecedents - one an Irish poet and philosopher, the other an American-Jewish
									surgeon <i>and</i> philosopher. The first writes:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"Often our loneliness and isolation is due to a failure of spiritual imagination.
										We forget that there is no such thing as empty space. All space is full of presence,
										particularly the presence of those who are now in eternal, invisible form."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									The second, equally, has no doubt as he states:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"As a healer I'm trying to get people to have faith in their own lives and in the
										whole process of life. You can act from that faith and make the rest of your life
										simple, or you can keep testing (the source of your faith) and make the rest of

									It is here, at this point in the contact or discussions that I have with individuals,
									that I find myself running into sand. Minds are preformed. They may be preformed
									through the existing religious beliefs of the person - beliefs that may be set in
									stone and allow for no re-examination or interpretation. Minds equally set in stone
									may be those of individuals who, for whatever reason, are determined to resist completely
									the idea of the <i>existence</i> of a spiritual state or of individually acting
									spirits. I have had to make my own adjustments, and come to terms with the <i>reality</i>
									of my own experiences.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the largest obstacles, points of disbelief, that many have, is with the traditional
									concepts of "God". God as creator of the Universe; God as an omniscient, prescient
									being, able to shape the lives of people and events on earth. On my computer screen
									when I switch on there is an image that came from the Hubble telescope, an image
									of the Whirlpool galaxy. I have it there partly for its intrinsic beauty, but more
									so to remind me of the <i>immensity</i> of the Universe, of the comparative insignificance
									of our sun and planet earth.</p>
								<p>
									On this earth I read of or watch almost daily the actions and behaviour of individuals
									and groups doing the most vile things to each other because of their varying and
									individual beliefs in "God" - Who is, nevertheless, so it is claimed, the <i>same</i>
									for all peoples. I have a number of friends who are Buddhist, who, while having
									a deep and active spiritual life, nevertheless, have no belief in a "God".</p>
								<p>
									Whenever I can, and from any available source, I acquire and study whatever is available
									relating to the evolution of the human species. Back and back, and yet further back
									they go, the palaeontologists, billions of years to "the fish that walked": to the
									tetrapod that breathed air, that became a mammal and became us. Across the room
									on a shelf is a fossil trilobite that was alive four hundred million years ago,
									and elsewhere in the house a fossil ammonite from some time later - both species
									having been wiped out in one or other of the mass extinctions that have beset evolution.
								</p>
								<p>
									And thus and thus I try to face reality and shape my beliefs, for while my intellect
									and observation enable me to keep my grasp on what I can see with my own eyes, or
									take into my hands and accept as believable, I nevertheless have had the experiences
									that I have related.</p>
								<p>
									I have had experiences that I have tried to describe as fully as my powers of expression
									allow, and have only held back when dealing with something that is spiritually and
									personally too deep and intimate to share. My experiences penetrate the interface
									between the visible and tangible and the "ethereal" and intangible. I have felt
									the physical strength employed by a spiritual source in the manipulation of my body;
									daily I am aware of the intrusive movement of "others" within my self and of the
									interactions within my mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the face of indifference and outright or unexpressed disbelief, I nevertheless
									continue to write, to explain, in the profound hope that <i>some</i> will accept,
									that <i>some</i> will profit. With the acceptance will, hopefully, come application
									- application of the knowledge in the care and "release" of individuals who have
									been similarly invaded and who have, as a result, become disturbed and ill.
								</p>
								<p>
									As I now begin to try to describe the reality of my current or past encounters with
									the "intruders", I think that you may yourself realise that I am not recounting
									<i>religious</i> experiences such as one might find in the lives of the saints or
									the like.
								</p>
								<p>
									What I am, in fact, presenting is a series of ploys that have been used, continue
									to be used, to undermine my thoughts and actions and motives. You might recognise
									them as parallel experiences in your own life or in that of someone you care for.
									What I hope you will recognise are examples of what are commonly called the "First
									Rank" symptoms of schizophrenia. What I also hope is that you will see that I have
									experienced them all, and recorded them in my own words - experienced and recorded
									some time before I had even become aware of such a list of symptoms. What I further
									hope to impress you with is the fact that <i>I have never been ill from this cause</i>.</p>
								<p>
									To remind you, let me list the symptoms as given in <i>Schizophrenia Genesis </i>
									by Irving J. Gottesman:
								</p>
								<ol class="generic">
									<li>Voices speak one's thoughts aloud.</li>
									<li>Two or more voices (hallucinated - <i>his words <u>not</u> mine</i>) discuss one
										in the third person.</li>
									<li>Voices discuss one's actions as they happen.</li>
									<li>Bodily sensations are imposed by an external force.</li>
									<li>Thoughts stop and one feels they are extracted by an external force.</li>
									<li>Thoughts not "really" one's own are inserted among one's own.</li>
									<li>Thoughts are broadcast into the outside world and heard by all.</li>
									<li>Alien feelings are imposed by an external force.</li>
									<li>Alien impulses are imposed by an external force.</li>
									<li>"Volitional" actions are imposed by an external force.</li>
									<li>Perceptions are "delusional" and un-understandable.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									Words such as "hallucination" and "delusion" are never my own choice, and I reject
									them and all their connotations <i>totally</i>. These are words used by the professionals
									in psychiatry and medicine, and imposed upon the "outside" world in default of other
									more suitable expressions. But, and let us be clear about this, they are not words
									which would be chosen by those who actually <i>experience</i> the phenomena. By
									the time the latter have come within the orbit of psychiatry, they have often become
									so disturbed that they cannot describe rationally what they are experiencing, and,
									by default, accept what they are told - that they are hallucinating, deluded. </p>
								<p>
									By contrast, and as I have described, apart from the brief period at the outset
									of my encounter with "voices" when I was deeply affected by what was happening to
									me - apart from then, all my experiences have come while I have otherwise been engaged
									in the <i>normality</i> of living. I drive to my local town; shop; borrow books
									from the library; travel to such places as the Hebrides, York, Scotland, on holiday.
									I have come to terms with my computer as a late starter - and you can judge my prowess
									for yourself. With its help I have communicated by letter or e-mail with a wide
									range of people including the Prime Minister and other major politicians, at least
									two retired consultant psychiatrists on matters about which I hold strong views,
									and received replies which indicate that my comments are welcome - indeed, one very
									well known professor of astronomy commented that he is always delighted to receive
									e-mails such as the ones that I have sent to him.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thus a life - perhaps a bit more adventurous than many, as I indulge the privileges
									of my seniority - a life in which I am accepted as someone who has all his marbles;
									a life that embraces a wide variety of interests and a life through which I have,
									with success, tried to help, encourage, individuals who are disturbed in their minds.
								</p>
								<p>
									As you read, therefore, please remember, and remember well, that these experiences
									are not the product of a diseased or sick brain or one with a chemical imbalance
									within, nor of an aberrant mind. Everything that happened did so when I was wide-awake
									and doing, or trying to do, the normal things of life. Please remember also that
									I am not writing on my own behalf, but as an advocate for the many who have similar
									experiences, who are rendered inarticulate or confused by them, who are labelled
									"schizophrenic" and who suffer all that society throws at them because of the label.
