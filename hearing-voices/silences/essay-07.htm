									I make no apology for writing yet again to draw attention to the book that I have
									written and published on the Internet. Consider this - I am almost seventy-nine,
									and statistics tell me that I have a finite amount of time within which I can create
									publicity. Why should I bother? Surprisingly, because I have yet to find published
									a book similar to mine that draws on twenty-five actual and continuous years of
									hearing voice.
								</p>
								<p>
									But more than that - of continuously experiencing all of the many symptoms that
									are classed as "first rank", when trying to arrive at a diagnosis of "schizophrenia".
									And yet, of being able to say "I have never been ill from this cause."</p>
								<p>
									Without much trouble, I could provide you with a list, probably hundreds of items
									long, of books and academic publications about schizophrenia. Indeed, so many that
									one could well believe in the existence of a "schizophrenia industry". Within that
									whole list, I would defy you to find a single publication produced by someone who,
									themselves, had actually experienced the conditions about which they are writing.
								</p>
								<p>
									I do not wish in any way to detract from the zeal and dedication with which researchers
									pursue their goal of trying to find a cause and cure of schizophrenia. Some with
									the selfless dedication of the true researcher: others with the active support and
									motivation of some of the major pharmaceutical companies, whose only belief seems
									to be that there will be a successful and marketable drug that will deal with this
									condition. All that I can say is that they are chasing theory and speculation: I
									am producing first-hand experience, and telling them "search no more"!</p>
								<p>
									"First Rank Symptoms" - just to remind you they are:</p>
								<ol class="generic">
									<li>Voices speak one's thoughts aloud.</li>
									<li>Two or more voices (in the mind) discuss one in the third person.</li>
									<li>Voices describe one's actions as they happen.</li>
									<li>4 Bodily sensations are imposed
										by an external force.</li>
									<li>Thoughts stop, and one feels that they are extracted by an external force.</li>
									<li>Thoughts, not "really" one's own, are inserted among one's own thoughts.</li>
									<li>Thoughts are broadcast onto the outside world and heard by all.</li>
									<li>Alien feelings are imposed by an external force.</li>
									<li>Alien impulses are imposed by an external force.</li>
									<li>"Volitional" actions are imposed by an external force.</li>
									<li>Perceptions are "delusional" and un-understandable. </li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									Throughout all of the time of which I write, I have kept notes, and an analysis
									of these shows that I had written about and described the actuality of these symptoms,
									albeit in my own words, long before I was even aware that there was such a list.</p>
								<p>
									If you are at all interested in learning of the tangible effect of these intrusions
									- for that is what they are - the consequences of spiritual intrusion into the mind,
									body and senses of an individual - then I urge you, nay, beg you, to read my book:&nbsp;&nbsp;
									<span class="note"><a href="/hearing-voices/silences/home.htm">
											selfdefinition.org/hearing-voices/silences/home.htm</a></span>
								</p>
								<p>
									Even though it is available as a free download, many have told me that they would
									rather have a book in hand, than, what amounts to, taking the trouble to download.
									For these - some of whom are good friends - help is at hand, for if all goes well,
									I shall be published in print early in 2005, and will announce the publication here.</p>
								<p>
									Normally one quotes from its introduction to give a foretaste of a book: just to
									be perverse, I am quoting from the closing pages: <span class="footnote"><a href="chapter-14.htm#part-11">
											[chapter-14.htm, part 11]</a></span></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										Satellite television has brought to me a fascinating window on a wider world and
										the opportunities to observe and try to understand, people from a vast range of
										cultures - people whom one saw previously, if one saw them at all, as "performers"
										in documentaries or devised programmes, and subject to the presentation and interpretation
										of the programmes' compilers. Now I can watch them completely untainted by the intervening
										"editor interpreter".</p>
									<p>
										I watch them in their own dramas, chat shows, news bulletins and a variety of presentations
										and versions of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" I look at faces and expressions,
										moods and reactions, but "look" and "watch" are the two operative words, for apart
										from sensing the general mood of the piece I have not the slightest idea of what
										is being said.
									</p>
									<p>
										When I watch Chinese television there are subtitles - but they also are in Chinese.
										I would dearly like to know what Dunia and the people whom she interviews on Abu
										Dhabi television are discussing, because it appears to be serious and intelligent,
										but apart from words that sound vaguely like "Iraq" and "Arabia", there is nothing
										to guide me. Worse still is a news bulletin when the person being interviewed is
										speaking English, but is then being talked over and the screen has rolling subtitles
										all in Arabic.</p>
									<p>
										The world and outlook of those who are locked into their inner voices is something
										like this. They have their own transmission received inside their head that no one
										else can hear or comprehend, while, viewed on the screen of life that is going on
										outside them, they see people, faces expressions, actions, moods and reactions,
										and try to interpret something that is far off. Something that is almost unreachable
										from within a mind and body that are often numbed by the drugs that are meant to
										make life more bearable (but which often are there solely to "contain" them). A
										world with which they find it increasingly difficult to communicate, to such an
										extent that attempts to do so may be abandoned altogether, especially when the inner
										world can appear warm and friendly.</p>
									<p>
										Is it easiest simply to abandon them to their inner world and the companions that
										frequent it? An inner world that can be welcoming, friendly, comforting - an inner
										world that suddenly can spawn terror and threat; create immeasurable anxiety; propose
										devilish and obscene compacts - compacts that if accepted can bring down an even
										heavier rain of threat and castigation from the unseen tormentors. One can go on
										and on in seemingly endless speculation, and offer insights and advice that may
										or may not have relevance to an individual - if indeed one knew that the torment
										was actually there behind the closed door that a life and the face fronting it have
										become.</p>
									<p>
										It would be difficult to forget the time when my stable was being re-roofed. Right
										to the fore of the action were the two Geordies - Big Derek and Brian. They came
										and worked - and worked hard - for "readies", and stayed until about one o'clock
										when they went off to the King's Head for a liquid lunch, and then possibly an afternoon
										fishing off the beach. One morning they came and they were immensely subdued, in
										fact, for such a big man, it was odd that Derek seemed close to tears. "Clarry's
										topped his self," said Brian eventually. Work was pointless, and they went off to
										the King's Head for more appropriate solace. Clarry - or Clarence to give him his
										Sunday name - had farmed with brother Ronnie, until they had given up the farm.
										But farmers never retire, and one met them here and there as they helped out on
										other farms - hedging, dykeing, walling, hay-timing - or working in people's gardens.</p>
									<p>
										Clarry had retired to a cottage beside the main road and I saw him frequently as
										he worked around a friend's premises. This particular morning his daughter had come
										downstairs, to a fire newly laid in the grate, a cup of tea part drunk and still
										warm, a sandwich half eaten, and, puzzled, had gone outside to find Clarry hanging.
										And no one knew why! It was over ten years ago, and I don't think anyone knows to
										this day. There in his inner world something had thrown a switch - but he had not
										been ill that anyone knew about - certainly not mentally. What was it that Clarry
										couldn't talk to anyone about - confide - consult?</p>
									<p>
										I thought of him in happier times, as for instance when the local Shepherds' Meet
										and a meet of the beagles had coincided, and the Brown Cow had been open all day
										- and Clarry hadn't wasted a minute. There he was, well into the evening, a huge
										turkey drumstick in his hand, beating time to the choruses of the hunting songs,
										and swaying perilously to and fro, and the picture of him swaying gently at the
										end of a rope is one that even now I find unbearable.</p>
									<p>
										I have difficulty revisiting the time when I desperately wanted to die and escape
										from all that plagued my mind and the situation that I couldn't understand but from
										which I frantically wanted to flee. I wasn't then hearing voices, but had seemingly
										insurmountable problems. Why didn't I just do it? As I wrote earlier, it had to
										appear to be an accident, and I couldn't devise one that I thought would be convincing.
									</p>
									<p>
										Relevant to my thoughts about Clarry - I couldn't talk to anyone, because I couldn't
										put my inner agony into words. I vaguely remember once saying to the Consultant
										as I attempted to broach the subject, something such as "I wish I had a terminal
										illness" - thinking that that would be a way out that would not create problems
										for anyone. "I suppose you want cancer" he said - and said it with a sneer; nothing
										else will describe his tone. I never tried to speak to anyone about it ever again,
										and I have only recalled the painful times for the purpose of writing to you to
										help you to understand the torment in the unseen world behind the facade of a face,
										and a life that is seemingly being "lived" successfully.</p>
									<p>
										"Writing to you" - I began to write more then five years ago. Some has come easy;
										some with the pain of unhappiness and disaster revisited. I hope that it has been
										worthwhile in that it may help someone. I began with the words of the diminutive
										Brazilian bishop, Dom Helder Camera, from which I get the title of my book, and
										cannot think of any that are more appropriate with which to end.
									</p>
									<p align="center">
										Don't get annoyed<br />
										If the people coming to see you,<br />
										If the people wanting to talk to you<br />
										Can't manage to express<br />
										The uproar raging inside them.<br />
										Much more important<br />
										Than listening to the words<br />
										Is imagining the agonies,<br />
										Fathoming the mystery,<br />
										Listening to the silences.
