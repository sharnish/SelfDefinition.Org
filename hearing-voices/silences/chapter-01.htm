							<h4>
								Introit ...
							</h4>

							<p>
								I am probably one of the people least likely to write anything remotely autobiographical.
								Not that I have led an uninteresting or uneventful life. As my friends know to their
								cost, they have only to press the appropriate button and they will have their ears
								bent with anecdote and happenstance for some considerable time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Essentially I am a private person and cringe at the products of this self-revelatory,
								tell-all culture in which we live. Daily, hourly, by the minute, on television and
								radio and in the printed media, people are pouring out the dross of their lives
								to a gaping, prurient world, and like most trash it is soon dumped and overlaid
								by the next batch.
							</p>
							<p>
								So why write anything at all? Friends persuade me that from what has happened to
								me, been inflicted upon me, there can be drawn that which may be of help and guidance
								to others; to people who find themselves overwhelmed by the problems of their minds;
								problems which flood their lives and threaten to submerge them, to drown them, or
								suck them down.</p>
							<p>
								If I were to find myself trapped in quicksand, the person most calculated to be
								able to help me, in whom I would have most confidence, would not be an expert in
								sand and water mixtures, emulsions, but someone who had actually <i>been there</i>,
								had been mired and sucked down; someone who had actually <i>extricated</i> himself
								from the slough - who, even though he used the immortal words of Corporal Jones
								in <i>Dad's Army</i>, "Don't panic, don't panic", would say them with all of the
								conviction and authority of someone who knew what he was talking about, and would
								back-up his words with the practical rescue techniques learned in the maelstrom
								of personal life-threatening experience.</p>
							<p>
								"Life-threatening"? But isn't this going to be an account of the perils that can
								terrorise, intimidate the mind? How can these be classed as "life-threatening"?
							</p>
							<p>
								I have twice been in these allegorical quicksands; the first time I was pushed,
								albeit accidentally, but over the long period in which I floundered I almost lost
								my "mental life", my mind; the second, much briefer time, the one in which I strayed
								accidentally and innocently into a mire, I found myself in grave danger of losing
								my spiritual life. So, in that context, yes; life-threatening. But also, and it
								must be faced, a point can be reached when suicide is the preferred option. So,
								"life-threatening"? Yes.</p>
							<p>
								Unless you have been there yourself, I imagine that you will have difficulty with
								the concept that death and oblivion could be preferable to continued life, assuming
								that one had any choice. Frankly, I hope that you never find yourself in that morass.
								But the imagination cannot conceive of the terror that can be created in the human
								mind from one's own tormented soul or which can be planted there by dominating "voices",
								from whatever source they may come.
							</p>
							<p>
								Perhaps a better understanding of the prospect of final submersion before the reality
								of which suicide is preferable, might be achieved by contemplating the dilemma of
								someone actually trapped and in imminent danger of being overwhelmed in real quicksand,
								and having in his hands the ready means of his own death and release.</p>
							<p>
								Sir Peter Scott in his wildfowling book, <i>Morning Flight</i> graphically paints
								in words the picture of his own brother, David, facing this very situation. David
								had spent a day alone wildfowling and found himself towards the close of the day
								having shot a widgeon, but it having landed on the opposite side of a small estuary.
								The tide being out, he had waded across and walked along the far shore. Suddenly
								he found the sand to be soft; he took two more steps and it became softer. He tried
								to turn back and he had sunk up to his knees.
							</p>
							<p>
								At every move he sank deeper, and the sand around him had turned to a viscous pudding.
								His movements became desperate and he made greater and greater efforts. When he
								stopped, he had sunk to his waist. The more he struggled the farther he sank, until
								he was so much submerged that he could no longer struggle. Only his head and shoulders
								and arms remained above the jelly-like morass. Then he began to think carefully
								of his position ... In an hour the flood tide would arrive. But he would not see
								it come. He would not watch the water approaching inch by inch until he lost his
								reason. There were two cartridges in his gun ...</p>
							<p>
								David was within moments of taking his own life when something made him turn, and
								there, a dark shadow on the tide, was a small boat with three net fishermen. After
								desperate and hoarse shouting and waving, they saw and came near, but not near enough
								for a rope to reach, so two of the fishermen got out ... they were adept at moving
								on the surface of the quicksand without sinking in. They hopped about "on all fours",
								never remaining more than a second in one place. They reached harder ground and
								from there threw a rope ... the men gave him hope and strength, and after ten minutes
								of tremendous effort he felt himself gradually working up and out ... It turned
								out that it was the first day of the smelt fishing season, and one day earlier there
								would have been no boat on the river.</p>
							<p>
								The quicksand of the mind and the quicksand of the shore are most terrible, most
								vile because they are invisible, indescribable. More terrible for the victim in
								his mind, because he cannot shout, for who is there to hear him, if indeed he knew
								<i>what</i> to shout. And yet, in the fastnesses of his mind, there is a desperate
								call, plea, for help.
							</p>
							<p>
								The quicksands of the mind are terrible because of their loneliness. On the brightest
								day, in the most sparkling company, the person in depression cannot lift his eyes
								to beauty, nor open his ears to the laughter, life and joy around. He is in the
								gut-empty world of no-mind; robbed of all emotion; unable to believe in human love,
								nor love from any source. If he knew them he would echo the words of the psalmist
								... <i>you have turned my friends and neighbours against me, my one companion is darkness</i>.</p>
							<p>
								But, while darkness brings the immediate oblivion of sleep, it is a traitor. It
								at first hides, then treacherously opens the trap-door to the world of no-sleep;
								the world of the night terrors; the world of no-time between true night and day;
								the world of the tormenting, mocking, teasing, dominating voices - voices from where?
								If you read on you will find an answer. It may not be an answer which you will want
								to read or which you will accept, but if you don't I'm afraid that that is your
								problem. My answer is the answer of personal experience.</p>
							<p>
								For nearly forty years, I have had experiences that I would rather not have had,
								experiences that could have made me exceedingly bitter. But the bitterness could
								further have harmed me had I let it take a hold. Instead, I have been exceedingly
								fortunate in being able to extract, distil from it all, much which has been, and
								is, enthralling and enlightening.
							</p>
							<p>
								Friends have persuaded me that others may derive benefit from my experiences and
								enlightenment. So, if you are yourself being engulfed in the quicksands of your
								mind; if you are calling for help in the silence of your mind; if you cannot silence
								the voices which invade your mind, dominate and torment you; if you care for someone
								who is struggling in the morass which their mind has become - if you are any of
								these I am writing for you. As someone who has been there, extricated himself, I
								am trying to throw you a rope; and while I do not hop around on all fours, I have
								learned to tread lightly, warily amongst these perils.</p>
							<p>
								I have a very good friend whose approach to a new book, no matter how devious or
								complex the plot, is just to dip at random each time he picks it up. I am still
								exceedingly baffled to know how he derives pleasure from his reading, or, indeed,
								apart from seeing the first and last pages, how he knows where the story begins
								and ends. If he ever gets to read my writings, I wonder just how he will approach
								them. Without trying to impose any compulsion on you, I shall be grateful if you
								will read what I have written in sequence, otherwise the thread, and much of my
								purpose in writing, will be lost.
							</p>
							<p>
								As I wrote at the outset, I open part of my life with reluctance, but with hope
								that you will benefit. Make of it what you will - each of you will see me differently.
								Many people quote the one well-known verse of Robbie Burns' poem <i>To a Louse</i>
								as if it embodies deep philosophy and wisdom; he wrote:
							</p>
							<div class="centering-container">
								<div class="centered-element">
									<div class="center">
										<p>
											<i>"Would some power the giftie gie&nbsp;us
												<br />
												&nbsp;to see ourselves as others see&nbsp;us."</i>
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>
								I have my medical notes covering a period of thirty years: they do not make for
								happy reading, particularly in respect of seeing just how one has been seen, interpreted.
								My advice to you is to decide for yourself just who you are, and to do all in your
								power to be yourself, hold on to your own identity, and strive for your own goals.
								It took me a long time and much hard work to recover my own life and identity after
								I had been robbed of them. So please, try to see me as I portray myself, and if
								you want to know how I lost and found myself again, well, just read on ...

							<h4>
								"We had to destroy it to save it."
							</h4>
							<p>
								Such was the bizarre reasoning given by the U.S. Authorities to justify the annihilation
								of a village during that most bizarre of conflicts, the Vietnam War.</p>
							<p>
								As I have begun to write, I have trawled through my own memory, and read, and come
								to terms with, the copious notes and correspondence that form my medical records.
								When you read what I shall write, I think that you may agree that the same "justification"
								could be applied to the almost-achieved outcome of the treatments that were brought
								to bear to "save" my malfunctioning mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								The treatments were applied with good intent, I have no doubt, by people who were
								established in their professions of medicine and psychiatry. But in the process
								of being treated, my <i>mind</i> was almost annihilated. So what went wrong?
							</p>
							<p>
								Well, to start with, at the outset, there was nothing <i>wrong</i> with my mind
								- it was functioning well and I was in control. But <i>something</i> must have gone
								wrong and to describe it is the purpose of the first part of my tale. The path ahead
								may at times seem a little tortuous, but I am sure that you will find the journey
								interesting.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the past, I have always enjoyed writing, although my authorship then had a different
								purpose in my professional role - reports, papers, proposals, were the offspring
								of my love of language, constrained by the accepted forms of technical writing.
								A fellow Welshman whose evocative use of language has never ceased to please me,
								is Dylan Thomas. When I listen to a recording of <i>Under Milk Wood</i>, from memories
								of people and places locked in my mind in my youth, I can "see" all the exquisitely
								drawn characters, I can "walk" down Cockle Row, I can "look" through the mind's
								eye of blind Captain Cat.
							</p>
							<p>
								For me there is only one recording - the first made by the BBC, with Huw Gryffudd
								as Captain Cat; the Reverend Eli Jenkins was spoken by Philip Burton, the English
								master at my school, and the one who set in train my love of language. But most
								of all, and no matter how often I listen, guaranteed to produce the same thrill
								of anticipation are the opening words spoken with his unique timbre by long-ago
								schoolmate Richard Burton. I can do no better than to recall his voice and echo
								it as he speaks ...

							<h4>
								To begin at the beginning ...
							</h4>
							<p>
								A high flyer was I. Was I? I shall never know now. No self-vaunted Icarus was I,
								flapping higher and higher on phoney wings, only to crash to destruction when the
								deceit was uncovered by the harsh sun of scrutiny. No: by dint of the steady wing-beats
								of hard work, dedication and loyalty, I was rising and being lifted from time to
								time on the up draught of peer approbation. So: how did I lose my feathers? Why
								did I crash? Why did I have to learn to walk again?</p>
							<p>
								How is it that such destruction can be visited on someone in broad daylight, in
								a civilised society, in his own home, in the midst of a caring family and, at work,
								under the gaze of a solicitous employer?
							</p>
							<p>
								And what did I lose? I lost a home which was still being carefully built up and
								consolidated; I lost my wife and, effectively, my daughter; in time I couldn't sustain
								my job and retired prematurely; financially, in today's (2003) values, I have lost
								over half a million pounds, while each year I receive in pension about one third
								of what I could reasonably have expected.
							</p>
							<p>
								But of greater worth, a worth which can not be measured in cash, I have lost a swathe
								of my memory; memory of a time when life was very good; when I had a wife whom I
								loved and who was yet young; when work was very rewarding and successful; when my
								daughter was blossoming. Do you know, I cannot remember how she used to talk when
								she was little; the things she said; bath times; bed times; Christmas; picnics and
								holidays; ponies ...
							</p>
							<p>
								I can barely remember the Sunbeam-Talbot that was the family's pride, or taking
								my mother and in-laws for "runs". I am fortunate in that I have a former work colleague
								whom I meet from time to time, whose reminiscences remind me of the highly successful
								and rewarding times we had as vital players in a cutting-edge project that was a
								world first, otherwise <i>that</i> memory would also be lost.
							</p>
							<p>
								So, how did I lose so much? How did I lose it uncomplainingly, trustingly? Surprisingly,
								and sadly, I lost it at the hands of, or perhaps more accurately, I had it all stolen
								by, the very people whose prime intent and professional purpose was to care for
								me. I lost it through the intervention of medicine and psychiatry.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is only one way for you to understand the extent of my loss - the actual loss
								over the years and the potential of what might have been - and that is for me to
								take you sufficiently far back in my life and career to find a convenient staring
								point.
							</p>
							<p>
								So how about 1947? I was 21 years old, in transition between life as a Petty Officer
								Radar Mechanic in the Royal Navy, and life as an undergraduate electrical engineer
								in the University of Wales at Swansea.</p>
							<p>
								Three years and an Engineering Degree later saw me, in 1950, make what was for me
								a very desirable move to the Lake District in Cumbria - scene of several pre-war
								family holidays - to work in the embryonic nuclear industry. My radar training and
								experience, combined with my degree, fitted me for the very fascinating and often
								novel world of measurement. I was becoming an Instrument Engineer.
							</p>
							<p>
								First promotion, and 1953, and I was part of the team destined to run the world's
								first nuclear power station, Calder Hall - which at the time that I joined was just
								a large hole in the ground! An exciting time of very hard but fascinating and rewarding
								work, and of personal change - of marriage in 1955, and parenthood in 1956, and
								a second promotion.</p>
							<p>
								The Works developed and expanded, as did the science and technology, and my responsibility
								- which led to a further promotion at the end of 1960. Thus, in what turned out
								to be an exceedingly crucial year, 1961, at age 35 I had the grade of "Principal",
								and a salary (2003 equivalent) of &pound;50, 000. I had been to France as an advisor
								during the commissioning of their first power reactor, and to Stockholm to address
								an international conference. I had a career, a home and a family, and the probability
								of more children. And with a further thirty years of potential employment, who knows
								how my future might have blossomed?
							</p>
							<p>
								To mention "diarrhoea" in the context in which I am writing may seem an unnecessary
								and unpleasant irrelevance: unfortunately, it became very relevant. We lived in
								Seascale, and in the late summer of almost every year the notorious "Seascale Bug"
								would strike, bringing stomach upsets, sickness and diarrhoea to the populace at
								random.
							</p>
							<p>
								When, thus, in 1961, I started with my episode of the "runs" it just seemed as if
								I was one of that year's unfortunates. But this was no ordinary visitation of the
								"Seascale Bug". Soon it seemed as if the whole of my inside had turned to fluid
								- the mediaeval term "the flux" was probably very appropriate. Day after day after
								day it continued, defying all the usual nostrums and quick-setting cements that
								were commonly effective. My "samples" yielded no known bacteria. My weight dropped
								by over a stone; the lavatory pan was my boon companion.</p>
							<p>
								Then, one day, a visit to my G.P. produced something new, something different. My
								medical certificate sported the letters C.A.N. in place of the usual "enteritis",
								and a prescription which, when dispensed at the local pharmacy, produced a bottle
								of black and green capsules coyly hiding behind the label bearing the legend "Librium".
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, remember, this was 1961; Librium was brand, spanking new; the word "tranquilliser"
								was not in common parlance. No warning bells rang in my mind - and why should they
								have? Like most people, I believed implicitly in the medical profession, in what
								they said was wrong with me, in the ways in which it should be put right. The average
								layperson has no base from which to query or dispute the medical opinion; one's
								view is often met with the slightly tolerant smile that seems to say, " The patient
								has an opinion, humour him and it will go away".</p>
							<p>
								I promise you this: there had been no discussion concerning my nervous state, nor
								was anything said about Librium, its purpose or its side effects. I had to deduce,
								yes <i>deduce</i>, that C.A.N. meant "chronic anxiety neurosis", and that I was
								"on" a tranquilliser. You may wonder at the lack of communication.
							</p>
							<p>
								All I can say is that I was very debilitated and unsure of myself, and that the
								doctor in question was very reserved, almost taciturn, and did not open himself
								to discussion. One former colleague at work even now reminds me of the response
								that <i>he</i> got when suggesting an alternative to <i>his</i> continuing treatment;
								whatever he was then told was prefaced with the put-down "We in the <i>learned</i>
								profession ...".
							</p>
							<p>
								(I must emphasise that I am not recounting this to denigrate in any way the doctor
								in question, who was immensely appreciated in the community both as a person and
								G.P., but simply to emphasise something to which I will no doubt return many times
								in this account and the other parts of my "story", namely this communication gulf
								between medical professional and lay-person).</p>
							<p>
								So, dutifully, I took my Librium in complete and blissful ignorance of the most
								common side effects - of confusion, drowsiness and inability to control voluntary
								muscular movements - and <i>physical dependence</i>! How, I wonder, would my employers
								have reacted had <i>they</i> known, for the Department at work of which I was head
								was responsible for every one of the measuring and safety devices in the whole nuclear
								power station of four reactors and eight turbines?</p>
							<p>
								No doubt everyone has those events in their lives over which they groan internally
								and long to extinguish the event and its consequences; this is one of my most desperate,
								as must be that of anyone who has started to take an addictive substance. How many
								clocks would be put back if given the chance?
							</p>
							<p>
								My anguish is made all the greater with the 20/20 vision with which all hind sight
								is blessed, and the knowledge, gained some 25 years after the events, of a newly
								identified parasite that can inhabit the lower gut and produce uncontrollable but
								<i>self-limiting</i> diarrhoea. Such a parasite one can acquire from polluted water
								or milk, or from animals - a route that the family hobby of riding and horse-work
								made readily available. <i>Cryptosporidium</i> is the name of what it is now believed
								was the cause of my illness - one of a group of parasitic protozoa.

								Looking back at the events covered by the next two years, much of what I did, felt
								and suffered can now be understood and many things fall into place.
							</p>
							<p>
								First, there was the growing addiction. My very first act on waking was to pop a
								pill. If I didn't get my noon "fix" on time I started to get the shakes. It was
								while I was doing this one day at work that I received my one piece of cautionary
								advice. It came from a former G.P. who had given up medical practice to found a
								firm which made endoscopes; he was visiting to supervise the installation of one
								of his industrial size 'scopes.
							</p>
							<p>
								When he saw the pill going in, he advised me instead to unwind at home each evening
								with a glass of sherry. Kind man that he was, on his next visit he handed me a brown
								wrapped bottle - " Special varnish" he said, "Don't open it here in daylight". I
								still think of rich, dark port wine as "special varnish".

								How I wish that I had been able to take his advice, but by now I <i>believed</i>
								that I had a C.A.N. How else could I explain the shakes that were cured by my next
								"fix"? How else to account for the drowsiness that was besetting me in my office,
								the "numbness" which enveloped my midriff and radiated outwards, the confusion or
								slowness in understanding the developments in computing, which specialist members
								of my department were engaged with? How else could I explain to myself the frequent
								malaises that had all the hallmarks of "flu without the temperature"?</p>
							<p>
								Life at work was getting difficult, particularly the drowsiness - but how can you
								explain to your next senior something that you didn't understand yourself, and which
								he didn't confront directly?
							</p>
							<p>
								(The problems contained in that one sentence, and all the other examples that emerge
								of the inability to address or articulate a difficulty or problem, of the impossibility
								of admitting or communicating to one's partner, friends, colleagues, medical advisers,
								more than an inkling of the gut-wrenching, mind-warping fears and fantasies which
								emerge, are topics to which I must return somewhere in the discourse if I am to
								draw meaningful conclusions and offer advice to others on ways to cope or support;
								but how difficult it is!).</p>
							<p>
								In the main, I was still doing a good job; no catastrophes, and many innovations
								at which I was particularly good. I remember, too, delivering a lecture to the Engineering
								Society on the subject of computers in general, and the ones in particular that
								we were then incorporating into the plant - the last major, positive event at work
								for some time to come. Such changes as were happening to my life and demeanour were
								yet acceptable and bearable compared with what was to come as 1963 was settling
								into autumn.
							</p>
							<p>
								The G.P. who had made the original diagnosis and prescription had moved back to
								his beloved Scotland, and to his replacement I remember saying "You have inherited
								my chronic anxiety neurosis" - me still accepting what I had been told, and he having
								no reason to question it. Socially we got on very well and his wife and mine became
								firm friends. However, his professional visits to the home began to cause him some
								concern and in time, he expressed the view that what I was experiencing was psychosomatic.
								He advised that I should see a psychiatrist and arranged for me to do so.
							</p>
							<p>
								After the encounter with Librium, the meeting with the psychiatrist has become another
								of my life's great "I wish it hadn't happened" moments.
							</p>
							<p>
								From this point on, I have copies of all my medical notes for the next thirty years
								- both those of the consultant and those of the local practice. The reason why I
								acquired them is revealed much later in my saga. Reading the notes - not an easy
								experience to cope with - it is revealing to see oneself as a "he", a third person,
								almost a specimen with a label.
							</p>
							<p>
								To me, as an engineer, the most glaring difference between my profession and that
								of the psychiatrist, is the latter's lack of certainty, of objectivity.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was used to dealing with a reality - my whole purpose in my work was measurement
								- the complete delineation of the state of being of a piece of plant or an operation
								as it was <i>then</i>, at that moment. I had seen my devices - the nerves of the
								plant - put in place. Nearly 50 years on, I have the personal and professional satisfaction
								of knowing that many of them, those completely inaccessible inside the nuclear reactors,
								are still there, still functioning. Their characteristics were known, for we had
								calibrated them; they told the operator exactly what was going on in the remote
								reaches of his plant; if anything broke down outside the reactor I had to know exactly
								why it had failed, and could only replace it with apparatus that had been thoroughly
								tested and calibrated.</p>
							<p>
								My Consultant (MC) appeared to be thorough, no question of that. We talked, he arranged
								tests, e.g. was hypoglycaemia a possibility? But to the outsider, there appear to
								be no certainties in psychiatry, only opinions and educated guesses based upon the
								personal experience and training of the one particular practitioner; possibly even
								the "school" of psychiatry to which he subscribes; no precise measurements or standards.
							</p>
							<p>
								Labels are put on "bottles" of symptoms - but the contents of the bottles seem to
								change at the whim of one school of research or another. Take for instance Alzheimer's
								disease. I can read the standard, original definition of a "pre-senile dementia",
								which, when originally identified and defined by Alzheimer himself, applied essentially
								to persons under the age of 55. Yet in a recent paper describing research into the
								prevalence of Alzheimer's disease amongst professional footballers, the author states
								that the condition is rarely experienced in persons under the age of 60!</p>
							<p>
								It is only in later years and being outside the maelstrom that I was then in, and
								fully in charge of my life and mind, that I can look back and be critical. But let
								me emphasise again, as I do through all that I write, that apart from those whose
								reasoning and lack of perception I condemn, and who will emerge later, I am not
								critical of the <i>intent</i> of any individual: I appreciate most deeply the care
								and concern which were lavished upon me by <i>all</i> the people whom I encountered.
							</p>
							<p>
								But I am a professional in my own right; my training and experience were on a par
								with most of the medical practitioners in <i>their</i> profession, and so I justify
								my own right to be critical of analysis and results. All this, of course, looking
								back with the benefit of the records in my possession, to let me see into the thought
								processes of those who were examining and analysing <i>mine</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								My perception of the lack of objectivity begins in the letter to GP2 sent after
								my first consultation. I was seen effectively as a "garrulous, bespectacled, Welsh
								hypochondriac". Welsh and bespectacled were irrelevancies that I couldn't alter,
								but who would <i>not</i> be a garrulous hypochondriac after two years on a continuous
								and substantial intake of Librium (which modern professional medical opinion now
								recognises as having been totally inappropriate and unnecessary!)?
							</p>
							<p>
								The fact that he rated me as of above average intelligence mollifies the personal
								affront to my self-image, which itself pales into insignificance before the recollection
								of what else appeared in the letter, and its immediate effect. After two years continuous
								use, at 10mg tds, my Librium was stopped forthwith and replaced by Tryptizol.</p>
							<p>
								Oh Boy! Does anyone want to know what "cold turkey" is like? My advice: don't try
								it! Recollect - I had been taking Librium in substantial dosage for over two years.
								Information readily available and unequivocal says that it is for <i>short-term</i>
								use. There is also full information about withdrawal after use - in my case after
								such dosage for so long my withdrawal might have taken <i>over one year</i>! Mine
								was overnight!
							</p>
							<p>
								The bizarre reactions and symptoms that I experienced are only partially recorded
								in my notes, but it was enough that when food was put in my mouth I lost contact
								with it, for I had no taste, no feeling down my throat. My stomach might not have
								existed for there was no sensation when I pressed that region, and I had no pressure
								sensation in my bladder. It was as if everything from my mouth to my fork no longer
								existed.
							</p>
							<p>
								The symptoms which I was experiencing were in fact so "global" that in the correspondence
								between MC and GP2, they were referred to as "this remarkable set of symptoms" and
								"multi-various physical symptoms". The possibility that they might be the effects
								of the instantaneous withdrawal from Librium was just not considered; everything
								I was experiencing was put down to a never-before-recorded idiosyncratic reaction
								to Tryptizol.</p>
							<p>
								Time off work and a return to Librium produced a measure of stability. "Stability"?
								Huh! Work was becoming a daily nightmare, if that isn't too paradoxical, while what
								was going on in the minds of my wife and daughter, I would not like to examine even
								after all this time.</p>
							<p>
								If you don't succeed in flattening him at the first go, why, just have another.
								A couple of days on Stelazine - immediate disaster - then a second bash, this time
								with Melleril. Same result; bizarre symptoms; brief flirtation with Nardil; reduced
								to quivering jelly. Hospital? Yes please. Refuge. I could, with relief and without
								feeling guilty, put aside my responsibilities at home and work.</p>
							<p>
								Electro convulsive therapy - E.C.T.? If you say so. "Sign here" - as a voluntary
								patient. Bang! The next assault on my precious mind began.
							</p>
							<p>
								Isn't it amazing how docile we are? Or maybe then we were more docile, accepting,
								than people are now. Perhaps people nowadays are better informed, or demand more
								information; also there are patients' support groups, and others active in attempts
								to outlaw E.C.T - it is, after all, a bizarre and dangerous "treatment". Whatever
								the analysis, there I was, good little Indian, ready to accept what the kind gentleman
								said because it would make me better. I am sure that you want to know all about
								it, for it is done in your hospitals, and by people who, indirectly, you employ.</p>
							<p>
								Three times a week the Ward went into its well-rehearsed routine. You wake and get
								up as usual, but have no breakfast. Shortly, you have an injection of a belladonna
								(deadly nightshade) derivative whose purpose is to dry the mouth and prevent you
								choking on your saliva. Meanwhile the nurses are playing trains with the beds, pushing
								them end-to-end in the corridor outside the treatment room. Next, as your turn approaches,
								a second injection, this time of a curare derivative. Curare, as you probably know,
								is the poison that South American Indians put on their blow-darts; the object of
								its use in this situation being to cause complete muscle relaxation and minimise
								the risk of vertebral fractures (after all it <i>is</i> electro <i>convulsive</i>
								therapy) - no mention of the possibility of <i>these</i> when I gave my "informed"
								consent!
							</p>
							<p>
								Let me quote from <i>The Oxford Companion to the Mind</i>:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									<i>E.C.T: Applying a voltage with surface electrodes on the head across the brain. This
										is done under anaesthesia or muscle relaxant, as it produces convulsions which can
										be dangerous.</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>E.C.T is extensively used as a convenient and quick treatment for depression, though
										there is no theoretical basis to justify it. There is considerable criticism of
										its extensive use because it may produce permanent brain damage, especially losses
										of memory and intelligence, though the evidence is not entirely clear.</i>
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								I want you to take particular note of the last sentence for reasons that will become
								pertinent later.

								You lie on the bed, shoes off and tucked under the mattress end. Chug - chug, the
								train moves on and your "carriage" is manoeuvred into the treatment room. Dentures
								out and into a glass. An anaesthetist tries to find a suitable vein in your arm
								and, when successful, dribbles in Pentathol, or a similar anaesthetic. Gentle bliss
								and oblivion.
							</p>
							<p>
								Next, electrodes are placed on your temples and a burst of electricity is switched
								into your lovely, delicate, unsuspecting brain. You don't know this, of course;
								what next you are aware of is gradual reawakening, bemused, head not present, an
								aching void in its place and sticky jelly clagged in your side hair. You gingerly
								get up, reclaim your shoes and teeth, and emerge into a pointless day. Nothing has
								<i>really</i> gone away - although it is at this point, and from now on, that your
								memory starts to be eroded, never fully to return.
							</p>
							<p>
								The staff were all immensely kind. I joined occupational therapy and became adept
								at basket making ("<i>In front of two, behind one</i>" was the oft repeated cry!),
								washed the dishes, and whiled away the evening in the quiet room. Then welcome bed,
								sans teeth, sans mind, and with hope of oblivion.
							</p>
							<p>
								Of course, there were sleeping pills - Soneryl, Sonergan, Seconal, Amytal, Mogadon
								- all have gone down my throat. But they were never effective at the time when <i>I</i>
								wanted them to be. Three in the morning. Someone once said that 3 a.m. should never
								have been invented; how I and many others would fervently agree. Wide awake, and
								staring into the void of my mind - not a place for exploration - torch flash on
								face as the "night watch" passes. Finally, and inevitably, get up for a pee (do
								all hospital ward toilets have such an unpleasant odour?). Lovely, kind Nancy, wife
								of Keith, a foreman at work, sitting in the night-station; brief chat; <i>"Sorry, I
									can't give you another sleeping tablet; here, try a Paracetemol"</i>; back to
								bed, maybe fitful sleep until the dreaded, but welcome day dawned again.</p>
							<p>
								I do not want to remember too much detail of such a drab time in my life. Nor, I
								suppose, will you want to read about it - but you should, for I am sure that unless
								it is to visit a close relative, or as a patient, you won't enter a Psychiatric
								Ward. You won't see the uncontrolled misery and loneliness in faces; you won't see
								the eyes glazed with drugs or E.C.T; you won't see the hopelessness of a person
								cut off and isolated from a welter of problems that will still be there on discharge.
							</p>
							<p>
								But like you, no one will want to visit. People can't cope, don't know what to say
								(Except, perhaps, "It'll be all right if you pull yourself together - yes, that's
								it - pull yourself together"). Great original thought; how many times did I hear
								it being said - often by husbands to wives, or wives to husbands, themselves full
								of woe at the disaster that had befallen their lives and homes.</p>
							<p>
								My own wife was magnificent. Never missed a visit; even later, when attending an
								evening class to prepare for employment should I become incapable of returning to
								work, she made sure that she came during the day. But she was the only one in a
								total of about twenty weeks in hospital. Nor were there visitors to the home when
								I was there and recuperating, apart, that is from a good friend and colleague from
								work and our Parish Priest. Not one.</p>
							<p>
								When, later, I became involved in complementary cancer care, I heard the same story;
								very few people, even close relatives, will chat. Most go out of their way to avoid
								even simple contact, conversation. There seemed then - I'm not sure about now -
								to be a stigma attached to someone with mental health problems, and a reaction that
								almost seemed to say that it was the fault of the ill person. (Many times have I
								heard people say, and I have said it myself, "I wish I had a crutch or a leg in
								plaster so that folk can see that there <i>is</i> something the matter!")
							</p>
							<p>
								But don't you think that you have a duty to learn more, to be compassionate, to
								understand, to be able to <i>talk</i> to people about their problems? For, after
								all, people are now being discharged to "Care in the Community". Well, for God's
								sake, you <i>are</i> the bloody community; they are there with you - in <i>your</i>
								care, not conveniently isolated, socially sanitised in some distant Victorian pile.
							</p>
							<p>
								The only time <i>you</i> want to know is when someone has an intractable "personality
								problem" i.e. someone who might be a sexual deviant, a paedophile. Then, Geronimo!,
								get out the vigilantes; hound them out of the community; castrate the buggers; lock
								them away even though they haven't committed a crime. They used to <i>burn</i> witches
								and social undesirables, didn't they? Not much really changes; the hysteria is still
								there. It is <i>your duty</i> to "get real", to understand fact and not mob panic.
								After all, not every schizophrenic is an axe-wielding maniac; most of them are very
								sensitive, isolated people.
							</p>
							<p>
								Statistically, <i>you</i> are just as likely as the next person to succumb to a
								nervous condition, a mental illness; if you learn more about it now perhaps it will
								never happen, you'll recognise the warning signs!
							</p>
							<p>
								In writing this account, I have started what has become, for me, a very interesting
								process. I have, until now, only read my medical notes in a very tentative way,
								just enough, really, to be able to compile a coherent account for my lawsuit. What
								little I read disturbed me and brought back such painful memories, un-bottled such
								nasty genies, that I hastily put the stopper back in the bottle.
							</p>
							<p>
								But as I now have a worthwhile reason for analysing that past, I am delving further
								and further in as I search for actual dates, actual events, actual drugs and treatments,
								actual dosages. Memories of events, sequences, dates and people are emerging, but,
								apart from the recollection of some individuals who did their utmost for me, I am
								finding much to cause me serious disquiet, and some to make me so very angry - even
								after so much time has passed. So angry that I can't yet begin to write about it,
								but shall confront it later when I finally summarise.
							</p>
							<p>
								In total I had ten E.C.T.s as an in-patient and, after the greater part of eight
								weeks in hospital, I was discharged home "much better", still taking Librium and
								Seconal. I am not a pharmacologist, but I <i>can</i> read, also I have or have had
								a number of friends in medicine and some in psychiatry, so an appreciation of drugs
								and their effects, alone or in combination, is not beyond me.
							</p>
							<p>
								While I intend to summarise and comment upon my various "therapies" during my conclusion,
								it is worth noting a few facts as I go along. Thus, Seconal is a barbiturate from
								which there can be severe withdrawal effects similar to those seen in alcohol abstinence.
								Librium, on the other hand, is a benzodiazepine, which <i>also</i> can cause dependence
								and withdrawal symptoms, and is prescribed for the <i>short term</i> (2 to 4 weeks only)
								relief of anxiety; its use should be reviewed regularly and should be discontinued
								as soon as possible - and other cautions and side effects too numerous to list here
								- except that benzodiazepines and barbiturates should not be taken simultaneously!
								At this point in my story, I had been taking Librium for <i>thirty months</i>.</p>
							<p>
								For some reason the notes and correspondence in my file are a bit sketchy over this
								period, don't ask me why. What I next see recorded, is that I had thirteen E.C.Ts
								as an outpatient between 14th April and 24th May 1964. I look at the copy of the
								form that I signed indemnifying the hospital against any injury that I might suffer
								in treatment, and at the form listing each session - the voltages and duration etc.
								- and memories come back of the breakfast-less journey to the hospital, crammed
								in a Social Services car, and the return journey, zombified. And I weep inside now,
								as I must have done openly then.</p>
							<p>
								Thus fortified, I finally got back to work. While I had been off there had been
								some logical organisational and staff structural changes. Calder Hall had become
								just another power station. The cutting edge of technology had transferred to the
								up-and-coming Advanced Gas Reactor, and staff of my grade were being dispersed,
								some to AGR and, in my case, to create a brand new department. Because of my innovative
								skills in the field of measurement that had come to the fore during the commissioning
								and experimental phases of the Calder reactors and plant, I was to be involved with
								experimental instrumentation.</p>
							<p>
								But where had I put my mind, my technical knowledge and expertise? Who were these
								people? I couldn't put names to faces or faces to names. I was isolated - physically
								in an office high in a new, tall building, and mentally because I had no base from
								which to think. At work I paced the office, bemused and feeling trapped. I couldn't
								express what I was feeling to anyone at work, for apart from the fact that you feel
								ashamed of your own lack of purpose, lack of achievement, people get embarrassed
								when you talk about personal, particularly nervous, suffering.</p>
							<p>
								(It was only later when I was competent again and people saw me working and coping
								with the aftermath of what I had been through, that their confidences came pouring
								out, because they knew that I had been "somewhere" - somewhere akin to where they
								were in their heads and lives. Gradually, I began to learn that behind practically
								every second door in this peculiar artificial village in which we lived, there was
								a little hell, disguised from the world by the special face that was kept by the
								door and put on when going out).</p>
							<p>
								When your mind is empty, incapable of constructive thought, it is very wide open
								to all the anxieties, doubts, and uncertainties concerning your present and future.
								What future? You can't even face the present, this day. Night is awful. Whilst bed
								is so desirable, such a refuge, the effects of the sleeping pill soon wear off,
								and you lie there sweating, almost seeing the entire board of management in censorious
								array like vultures on the bed-end.</p>
							<p>
								One reason why there was not a lot written and my notes are so sketchy at this time,
								is because I wasn't talking about what was actually <i>in</i> my mind, what I was
								planning to do. I was planning to take my own life. But I couldn't talk about it
								- it had to appear to be an accident, and if I showed premeditation, I thought,
								my insurance policies would not pay out; but I couldn't ask anyone if they <i>would</i>
								pay out because that might show premeditation and my insurance policies might not
								pay out. My planned method was electrocution, but that is difficult to stage in
								the home in such a way as to appear to be accidental, and my ingenious mind just
								was not functioning.</p>
							<p>
								As I walked to the train each morning, I used to look at the wheels of the school
								buses and wonder if I could find the courage to stumble under one; or, on the platform,
								whether I could contrive a fall in front of the train as it came in. At night I
								used to wish fervently that I had been killed along with the thirty-five friends
								and shipmates who had been fragmented or incinerated within feet of me when the
								destroyer, HMS <i>Saumarez</i>, in which we were serving, was mined.
							</p>
							<p>
								Obviously, I did not succeed or even attempt, (though it has only struck me as I
								write that in the Seconal at home I had the ideal "remedy" - easy to overdose, but
								in my state of mind I couldn't even see <i>that</i> possibility). There is, however,
								something that I can tell you without fear of contradiction: there is no place on
								earth more lonely than the mind of someone who wants to die, to achieve <i>oblivion</i>
								(unless it be the mind of someone facing execution). The most isolated Siberian
								tundra or Gobi desert wastes would provide more solace than the domain of your mind.

							<p>
								Before I contrived my "accident" or otherwise achieved my own destruction, I was
								saved by Pentathol. Have you lost the plot? Let's get up to date. We are now at
								the end of July 1964, and a new strategy was being proposed. I may not be giving
								them enough credit, but MC, GP2, and the medical staff at work were individually
								and collectively concerned about my state of mind and future, and discussing ways
								and means.
							</p>
							<p> The Pentathol strategy applied the relaxing anaesthetising properties
								of the drug to achieve within me total bodily relaxation, in the hope that my mind
								would respond as well. (In case you have forgotten, I still had no mind). So, three
								times a week I was driven to the hospital in a Works' car and had Pentathol dribbled into me
								as I slowly "blissed out", as my Buddhist friends would say. There was one Indian
								registrar who could dribble it in <i>very</i> slowly and actually inject <i>two</i>
								syringe-fulls - oh! the ecstasy (and the agony - for nothing goes away, and the
								let-down on waking is so bleak).</p>
							<p>
								But fear not, dear reader, (sound of bugle, yet far off) help is on the way. MC
								has been to a conference, and come back bursting with new ideas. For me there had
								been a paper in which excellent results had been achieved in some creatures - possibly
								wild dogs - in which large doses of Valium (or Librium, I am trying to recall a
								memory) had been used to good effect.
							</p>
							<p>
								Well done! You've caught up with the plot! <i>I</i> would have large doses of Librium
								(or Valium). There is nothing that I can find in the notes that relate to this particular
								trick, but like some other "special" memories that have stayed with me, this one
								is particularly vivid, as is the memory of the reaction of GP2. He visited me at
								home almost every day, in my darkened room from which I wouldn't stir. After several
								days, he stared into my eyes, realised where I was (or wasn't) and said "You're
								drugged out of your mind!". Before you can say "benzodiazepine", I was back in hospital.</p>
							<p>
								All of my files, notes and correspondence were obtained by my Solicitors as we sought
								to make a case to sue the makers of these drugs, an abortive venture, as it turned
								out, so fickle is blindfold Justice. In making the case, I had a long session with
								a Consultant Psychiatrist who was retained by the various law firms. He started
								interviewing me in the usual manner, but as my story unfolded he just sat there,
								silent, a sad, sympathetic little smile on his face, his head sometimes shaking
								from side to side in sheer disbelief that so much could have been visited on one
								person.
							</p>
							<p>
								But don't go away, psychiatry has so <i>much</i> to offer. The time has come to
								introduce you to yet another form of shock treatment - insulin shock treatment,
								or, as it now is, <i>modified</i> insulin treatment (it was modified so that there
								is now a smaller chance of killing you). This form of shock treatment relies on
								the injection of increasingly large doses of insulin with the object of reducing
								the blood sugar level and bringing on a coma.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is how the modified form works: you are woken at about 5 am and given an injection
								of insulin. You continue to lie in bed for a couple of hours and soon start to sweat
								and shake uncontrollably, then, while still in bed, you get placed in front of you
								a tray with a dish of corn flakes heaped, and I mean <i>heaped</i>, with glucose
								powder, and a full fried breakfast plus toast. No problem eating it, you are ravenous.
								A little while longer in bed then get up and have a shower (compulsory). I became
								so inert and depressed that I couldn't even bother to shower, sweaty and niffy though
								I was - sometimes I just used to shut myself in and pretend.</p>
							<p>
								I had in all twenty-six such episodes that, at five a week, took me into the sixth
								week. How depressed I got, so very, very depressed. I used to pace the corridors
								feeling utterly lost, pointless and empty; sometimes I went into the next-door geriatric
								ward just to see people who had less mind than I had.
							</p>
							<p>
								I craved exercise, but when I asked if I could go to the older, former hospital
								not far away where I knew there was a rehab gym, I was fobbed off and got no help
								- "Just go for a walk". Where? In the wet, featureless lanes with their potholes
								and puddles, just behind the hospital, in the autumn? So drab, so weary, so empty
								- the name "Sneckyeat Road" does as little for me now as it did then!
							</p>
							<p>
								One day, MC said to me "You were referred originally with an anxiety state, now
								you have a full blown clinical depression". Well, we were making progress, that's
								something.
							</p>
							<p>
								When it looked as if I was in for a long haul, the occupational therapist suggested
								something that I had always wanted to do. Weaving. There was a table loom as yet
								untried. Great! I'd have a go. What to make?
							</p>
							<p>
								"Why not place mats?" said my wife who occasionally came in to OT. So off she went,
								and came back with some bright orangey Courtelle, and I started. Things that I had
								only read about before began to become realities - making the warp, the poree cross,
								and whatever the other one is called; heddles, shuttle, and beater all became realities.
								Then, entering the warp. That could have been difficult, but one of the nurses had
								worked at Coates' thread factory where she had been involved with just such a task
								in making up thread samples for display and advertising. So, with one at one end
								and the other at the other end of the loom we were soon "entered" and I was away.
							</p>
							<p>
								While my days weren't "swifter than the weaver's shuttle", they nevertheless received
								a boost from this particular shuttle. I had to overcome some difficulties of technique,
								but eventually I created six place mats, a centrepiece and a tray cloth. I still
								have them, a little worse for wear.
							</p>
							<p>
								One hears so much these days in our new "consciousness", our new awareness, of "body,
								mind and spirit" - the totality of being human. My body was still there, recoiling
								from the many attacks made upon it; my mind had a certain ephemeral quality, though,
								on reflection, it had the reaction of a lead balloon showing sudden half-hearted
								attempts to lift off. My spirit? Now there's a thought; if I ever had a spirit,
								where was it now?</p>
							<p>
								Becoming a Catholic when I married I had become a very diligent follower of my new
								"brand" of Christianity, but in my depressed state, where indeed <i>was</i> my spirit?
								Had I just been going through the motions? Had I ever had anything of the sort?
								Must find out.
							</p>
							<p>
								The church not far away was manned by Benedictine monks, and so, remembering one
								whose words one Sunday at Mass had impressed me, I rang. With not a moment's hesitation,
								he jumped on his Noddy bike and put-putted over to see me. I still have a little
								book which he gave me (Funny, his name was Father <i>Little</i>; the book - <i>They
									Speak by Silences</i> was a series of meditative thoughts by an anonymous monk
								of the silent Carthusian order and is one that I still, more than thirty-five years
								later, use for "provocative" meditation) in the hope that I would find solace in
								its words, and to this day I am grateful for his earnest attention and compassion.
								But in spite of his help, what I now know as "spirit" never materialised in me,
								and never did until I experienced the events that I write about elsewhere.</p>
							<p>
								Here is a thought, though; if you want to know what it is like to be in deep depression
								(no, it is not just being "fed up"!), read Psalm 88. I'll quote it briefly, as it appears
								in the <i>Jerusalem Bible</i>, but do read it all for you may get some insight.
								It is called "Lament": as he cries out to his God ...

							<p>
								But soft! What is happening? MC is beginning to have self-doubts. Would I like a
								second opinion? - He would. So 'twas arranged, and one November morning I was driven
								with others who had a variety of appointments, to the ultimate seat of learning;
								me to see a Big Wheel (BW), one who went on to become a Very Big Wheel, at the mention
								of whose name a young psychiatrist, to whom I quoted it many years later, visibly
								genuflected.</p>
							<p>
								But no, such is the way that things work, protocol etc., I did not immediately see
								BW; instead, at first, I was taken to his Registrar or Little Wheel (LW). For about
								half an hour, possibly forty minutes, he interviewed me as if it was my very first
								encounter with a psychiatrist.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, there is an unkind saying in education that "those who can, 'do'; those who
								can't 'do', teach; those who can't teach, teach others to teach; while those who
								can't teach others to teach become either education administrators or researchers".
								I feel that there must be an equivalent gradation in psychiatry.
							</p>
							<p>
								I don't know what had brought LW into the profession, and into research in particular,
								but it certainly wasn't his human interplay. He exhibited not one glimmer of concern
								or sympathy for my condition or experiences; he had about as much empathy towards
								me as a gardener has towards a green fly. He was hostile, sarcastic and belittling.
								Just one example will suffice: I tried to explain the depths of my desire to die,
								to commit suicide. Had I, as one does, gone to a high place to throw myself off?
								No? Well, I couldn't have been all that serious, could I? It may not sound a very
								great put-down, but in the context of the others, the sarcasms and negations of
								what I was telling him, it was.</p>
							<p>
								However, he had been well primed in his negativity. The letter from MC itself was
								so negative, but not only that, he seemed to go out of his <i>way</i> to be negative.
								Take, for instance, his comments about the state of our marriage: he records that
								both my wife and I said that we were happily married; however, <i>he</i> knew better,
								<i>he</i> had got a snippet (apparently from GP2) which cast doubt upon <i>our</i>
								understanding of the situation, doubts that he reinforced, but did not specify from
								a source that he didn't identify. One wonders why he had to put in yet another negative,
								unsubstantiated, keyhole-peering remark. <i>Why</i> did he not rely on what my wife
								and I said? After all, we were the main players. Throughout this period, she could
								not have been more devoted, more caring; "TLC" might have been coined to describe
								her attitude.

								In our wider life, and with our daughter, we were fortunate to have a family interest
								- almost obsession - in riding and horses. We rode whenever possible, had riding
								holidays, took a deep and intelligent interest in improving our riding skills, mixed
								with like-minded people and made many friends outside the works environment, outside
								the peculiar Seascale society. Many of these friends we still have. Yes, we! For
								although, as I shall describe, we ultimately parted and divorced, we have remained
								excellent friends, a friendship manifested in a variety of ways that are not here
								relevant.</p>
							<p>
								Before my life was so bludgeoned, I frequently rode a particular horse that was
								being looked after by some friends. Smokey. Such an eager, willing horse; black;
								not very big; but he took me everywhere, from the miles of beach to the fell-tops,
								and along all the many bridle-paths with which this area is blessed. He was a boon
								companion and I can still recall his moving body under the saddle.
							</p>
							<p>
								When I was recuperating after the first spell in hospital, my wife told me what
								she had been keeping from me - Smokey was dead, killed by lightning in his field.
								She also told me that she had been saving up to buy him for me. <i>That</i> reflects
								the marriage that I knew at that time, not the almost evil representations or half-hints
								that the letter contains.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have tried since, indeed, I am trying now, to deduce why things were being said
								about our marriage that at the time were patently untrue. Since we are in the domain
								of Sigmund Freud perhaps we can get a little Freudian. I have observed in many men,
								probably in myself also, the in-built, virtually unconscious belief held by each
								that he is the one who can take over this female's life, protect her, sort her problems,
								give her better sex than she is currently getting. To do which, as in nature, he
								has to expose the weaknesses, real or invented, in her current husband, partner,
								boyfriend; particularly if the latter is in any way vulnerable.
							</p>
							<p>
								I see a manifestation of this occurring among the fifteen or so rams that are sometimes
								held in my field in the autumn. If one has any defect, first one ram and then all
								the rest in turn or together, will butt and harry him persistently, all, no doubt,
								responding to the in-built behaviour of their evolution. We are the sum total of
								<i>our</i> evolution, nothing lost, nothing taken away, and we have it within ourselves
								to behave just like the rams.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am not in the remotest way suggesting that anything improper was even <i>thought</i>,
								but my wife was a very attractive woman, not only in her looks, but also in her
								vivacity and openness of speech, and the marriages of GP2 and MC were under stress.
								Remarks made to me by GP2 during his consultations showed a certain disillusion,
								while MC in a short time parted from his wife and they ultimately divorced. In my
								analysis, I am suggesting their own personal situations were unconsciously being
								played out in mine, and in my "vulnerable" state I was the ram being "butted" -
								and once one starts everyone joins in. A bit convoluted, but <i>I</i> know what
								I mean.
							</p>
							<p>
								You may think that I am being selective, or that I have an agenda of vindictiveness
								against the people whom I perceive as having perpetrated wrongs upon me in the past.
								I can tell you this; if anyone has proper credentials and a legitimate reason for
								wanting to see the letters and reports, they can come here and I will willingly
								show them and put them in context.
							</p>
							<p>
								What I find hard to reconcile are the two images that I now have of MC - the man
								who sat, as I shall describe, urbane and friendly, tying salmon flies in a little
								hand-held vice, while I had my fortnightly "psychotherapy", and the man who wrote
								the letters and reports that contain <i>nothing</i> to indicate that I had any achievement
								or standing. In fact the reverse; his whole thrust seemed to say that I never had
								any potential and never would.
							</p>
							<p>
								I know that he had only seen me from the outset under the influence of Librium;
								I know that when first seen I had a label around my neck which said "Anxiety State",
								but I would have thought that he would have had some discernment, and would have
								realised that I wouldn't have got where I had without talent.
							</p>
							<p>
								We were roughly of an age, and had reached about the same level, each in our own
								profession, and, indeed, I had reached at thirty-five a grade that many engineers
								in public service didn't reach in their whole careers. As I wrote earlier, I had
								represented the Company in France and Stockholm, and, big disappointment, I was
								told when I was making recovery that it had been intended that I should be seconded
								to Japan during the commissioning of some of the Japanese nuclear reactors, but
								that my illness had scotched the move.
							</p>
							<p>
								So perhaps you can understand my perturbation and inability to comprehend the behaviour
								of someone in whom I confided much and perceived as a friend and confidant. However,
								now I realise as I read deeper and deeper in my files that what I thought were personal
								confidences were, in fact, incorporated into the next progress report to my GP,
								and retained in my personal file where they remain yet, colouring the view of me
								of every subsequent GP who has read them.
							</p>
							<p>
								When LW had completed his interview, he went to see BW and was confined with him
								for about twenty minutes, after which I was invited in. Neither sat; I don't remember
								whether or not I did. I was not put at my ease, nor made to feel welcome - I felt
								I was an irrelevance. I still had my raincoat folded over my arm; such was the extent
								of the courtesy offered to me. I remained in the room for no more than ten minutes,
								and can only remember one question or remark. This was to be asked what my greatest
								concern was, to which I replied that my memory had been so affected that I feared
								it would not fully return. I was assured that it would - and that was that. Back
								to the hospital and await the verdict. When it came, I was told that Pertofran and
								Valium had been recommended, and that the recommendation would be accepted. So began
								the next phase of my drug regime. I was eventually to take Pertofran for ten years
								and Valium for twelve.</p>
							<p>
								I don't know whether MC knew, or even guessed, that the letter that he received
								analysing my consultation had not been written by his Guru. I know now, having read
								it several times, that it may have been <i>signed</i> by BW but was definitely drafted
								entirely by LW. There is virtually every undermining remark, put-down or sarcasm
								that he had spoken to me appearing in black and white. This letter, too, has its
								niche in my surgery file. Therefore, MC was, in reality, relying upon the analysis
								and opinion of someone effectively of lower standing, and one presumes, less experience
								than himself.
							</p>
							<p>
								I recollect when, early in my career, I attended a junior management-training course.
								One of our group exercises was to conduct a court of enquiry into a site accident.
								We were given the "official reports", witness statements and other corroborations
								that we studied, and then we called and interviewed every one of the parties, admirably
								role-played by staff of the Training Department. We questioned and re-questioned
								and then we deliberated and finally reached our conclusion.
							</p>
							<p>
								But where had we gone wrong? What had we missed? Well, I'll tell you. The accident
								had happened on a day late in November, at 4 pm. It had been <i>dark</i>! So obvious
								when you see it, but it had eluded some eight or so budding young managers.
							</p>
							<p>
								So what relevance does this bit of philosophy have here? Well it concerns the analysis
								essentially by all three, BW, LW and MC, of the reasons for my loss of memory and
								my great concern about it. I won't rehearse the reasons given other than to say
								that the word "hysterical" appears.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, can you recollect that earlier, after the description of E.C.T and the definition
								quoted from my reference book, I asked you to note a particular sentence? Hands
								up who can remember. Read: learn: memorise:- <i>There is considerable criticism of E.C.T
									because it may produce permanent brain damage, especially losses of memory and intelligence</i>.
								How many E.C.Ts had I had? Well done, that's it:- <i>twenty-three</i>. I rest my
								case.
							</p>
							<p>
								No, I <i>do not</i> rest my case. Just where had they come from, these three "soothsayers"
								who, each like an ancient Etruscan haruspex, were picking over the entrails of my
								life and mind? I have related how it came to pass that I was suffering this "disembowelling"
								process, but how was it that <i>they</i> came to have such jurisdiction over my
								mind, my precious mind? Were they part of a self-selecting, self-perpetuating "priesthood"?
							</p>
							<p>
								The next time that Stephen Hawking appears on your television screen, pause a while
								and reflect upon that contorted body, the twisted face and head; read some of what
								he has written, and reflect further that this is one of the most brilliant minds
								of our time contained there in that pathetic shell. When you have done that, see
								whether you can disagree that one's mind is the most precious of one's possessions.
								I was in grave danger of losing mine, of having it destroyed; I <i>know</i> how
								precious it is and I defy you to disagree!
							</p>
							<p>
								Some years after the time of which I am writing and, as I shall relate, I made my
								way back up the recovery ladder, I was, for a time, in charge of training for the
								whole of the Sellafield complex. As part of my self-education in this post, I took
								myself off to a conference at Cambridge organised by a research team who looked
								at aspects of industrial training.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the discourses involved someone from the Bristol University Dental School.
								The school had a problem. Aspiring dentists proceeded into their training for several
								years before they actually came to grips with a tooth in a mouth. At this stage,
								it was found that some were so lacking in manual dexterity that they were forced
								to abandon dentistry and transfer to normal medicine on a parallel course. To minimise
								the waste involved in this abortive training, the Dental School were working with
								the researchers to try to devise a simple test of manual competence that could be
								used to assess aspirants <i>before</i> they embarked upon a course for which they
								were obviously not suited.
							</p>
							<p>
								Is there, one wonders, an assessment process for aspiring psychiatrists, one that
								seeks to determine whether <i>they</i> have the necessary skills and talents to
								be allowed access to the most precious possession that anyone can have?
							</p>
							<p>
								Do not treat this as an irrelevance, a hypothetical question, for statistically
								you are as likely as the next person to have the "entrails" of <i>your</i> mind
								picked over, to have <i>your</i> brain corrupted by some mind-altering drug, potentially
								with side-effects far worse than many "conventional" illnesses. I have only, within
								the last few days, noticed a small letter "hiding" in one of the files of my records.
								It is the letter written by MC to BW following receipt of his advice with respect
								to my further treatment. He thanks BW for his advice and taking the trouble, then
								goes on:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									<i>"I must both thank you and apologise to you for the trouble you have gone to with
										the cases I have referred to you during the year I have been over here. They have,
										I am afraid, run to this sort of pattern and you will appreciate that this is the
										result both of the difficulties that they present and, I fear, lacunae in my own
										training."</i>
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Yes, I have looked it up, just to confirm what I believed the definition to be:
								a <i>lacuna</i> is a gap, omission, hiatus; <i>lacunae</i> obviously are these in
								plural. Imagine what would have been my thoughts had I been aware at the time. I
								had been a patient for just one year and was, therefore, one of the first patients
								of the consultancy; there had been other second opinions; had we, by any chance,
								each fallen through a lacuna?
							</p>
							<p>
								Let me recap at the end of this "formative" year in my life. When it began, I had
								already been taking Librium for two years; I continued for virtually the whole of
								the year, with a mid-point interval at a double dose rate, before changing to Valium.
								There had been brief interludes with Tryptizol, Melleril, Nardil and Stelazine;
								there had been Soneryl, Sonergan, Seconal, Amytal and lastly Mogadon to pacify my
								nights. I had suffered twenty-three sessions of E.C.T and twenty-six episodes of
								modified insulin shock treatment. In total, I had received forty-three injections
								of Pentathol, plus twenty-three each of belladonna and curare derivatives, and now
								I was going to start on a regimen of Pertofran, Valium and Mogadon.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Dare I ask you to remember that at the very outset, I had no episode or history of
									nervous or psychiatric ailments - I had uncontrollable diarrhoea, nothing else?</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								In time, all good things come to an end and I left hospital and recuperation, and
								started back at work. My employers were very supportive, and placed me with congenial
								people in work that was quite undemanding. So slowly I settled. The gradual restructuring
								of my life began and the building of confidence was real. After a time I was asked
								to take over Engineering Training and, eventually, the Training Department covering
								the whole of the establishment.
							</p>
							<p>
								At one time, had I been taken to a high place and, with all of the possible jobs
								in the Works laid out before me, asked to pick one, the last, the very last choice
								would have been Training! However, I was more grateful than I could say to the Works'
								management for the way in which I had been reintegrated into work, and, anyway,
								it is said that in every Welshman there is a latent preacher or teacher, so maybe
								I had met my destiny. Many interesting developments were taking place in the world
								of industrial training and I was soon absorbed.
							</p>
							<p>
								At home, I found in time that my wife had carried the burden of my condition for
								too long, and she herself became ill. There came a time when it felt as if we were
								two drowning people clutching at the same straw. MC, who was aware of what was developing,
								urged me most strongly one day - "For God's sake, get out - go and camp somewhere,
								but get out". And so I did. I took a flat in a converted farmhouse - and by one
								of those quirks for which fate is so famous, the flat below me was taken simultaneously
								by the Clinical Psychologist from MC's department.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once one has separated, it seems to be virtually impossible to reunite and rebuild
								what had been before, and so, inevitably, my wife and I divorced. In time, I was
								lucky in finding this house with its land suitable for horses, moved here in 1971
								and have lived here ever since. Again, giving the lie to what MC had said about
								our marriage, it was my former wife who actually was instrumental in my finding
								it in the first place.
							</p>
							<p>
								Almost without a break until about 1970 I continued with psychotherapy, although,
								at the time I wasn't aware that that is what it was, so little did the "medicine
								of the mind" figure in one's everyday considerations; all I knew was that it was
								"good to talk".
							</p>
							<p>
								However, coping with a solitary life and the increasing demands of work (ironically,
								because I became enthusiastic and could see the potential of the new moves in industrial
								training <i>I</i> was placing the demands on myself), because of these factors I
								found myself "going backwards" at work. Whereas I had had much support following
								my initial return to work, and when I took up my role as Training Manager, now I
								found that patience seemed to have run out, and my absences were seen in a different
								light.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was not realised, probably wasn't even addressed, that the continuous drug regime
								was taking a devastating toll of my faculties. I was even now taking Pertofran and
								Valium, and had recourse to Mogadon at night, so you may perhaps judge that the
								start of each day was a little uncertain.
							</p>
							<p>
								I had a most marvellous Girl Friday at work, Val, who could look at my eyes first-thing
								and then decide if she should stall callers until after 10 am. In time, the constant
								struggle became unbearable, and one day, in late summer 1976, I set out for work
								and didn't arrive. Instead, I turned off my normal route and took refuge with a
								friend with whom I holed-up for two days. That, essentially, was the end of my working
								career. In time I was pensioned off at fifty-two and then a new phase in my life
								- indeed, a new <i>life</i> - began.
							</p>
							<p>
								But what sort of new life? The very state of not going to work was in itself a new
								life, and I knew within myself that I had had enough; nothing was worth the growing
								loss of ability and status, and the struggle to do well things that previously I
								could have done in my sleep.
							</p>
							<p>
								If I had known how this new life was going to unfold, what would I have thought,
								what would I have done? But I wasn't yet in the state of mind to ask myself "What
								am I going to do with this freedom now that I have made my escape?". I was rather
								more like the survivor of a shipwreck who has only just made it to a shore - he
								didn't <i>care</i> what shore - all he knew was that he wasn't fighting something
								alien anymore.
							</p>
							<p>
								When I look back at that time, it is quite startling to recall how a new life developed
								almost by spontaneous combustion. I marvel at the expansion - expansion of my circle
								of friends, expansion in the range of my activities; activities and contacts that
								opened up an entirely new world - a world that I hadn't previously explored or even
								thought much about.
							</p>
							<p>
								And my spirit? I had never, not since I posed the question in hospital twelve or
								so years previously, found an answer - never really given it much further thought.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just five more years down the line and I was to have some enlightenment. It was
								as if in me there was taking place the metamorphosis of a former caterpillar, now
								in its cocoon, waiting to emerge to make its destined flight. But I knew as little
								of what was involved in flying as did the caterpillar when it started to spin the
								silk of its cocoon. All of this lay ahead.
							</p>
							<p>
								I still don't know whether I would have taken a different path - too often in life
								we never have the option to choose, or never realise that there is a choice, until
								we have committed ourselves. As you read further, perhaps you will have an opinion;
								for myself, I shall leave the analysis until I reach it in the logic of the narrative.
								At this moment, I have just been cast up on the shore and I am so grateful that
								I have survived.
