                                    I came to live in my present house in 1971. Finding it was the result of a happy
                                    coincidence of someone wanting to emigrate and myself actively looking for somewhere
                                    with land and grazing for my horses. Two hectares of land, and a setting on the
                                    western slopes of the Cumbrian fells that has visitors using such words as "paradise"
                                    (although they may be speaking of my cooking, which is out of this world!).</p>
                                <p>
                                    I am on a narrow plateau and surrounded entirely by farmland; the seas are visible
                                    to the west, while east the ground rises to a high ridge. I had to make some adjustments
                                    in that there are no mains water, gas, or sewerage. The gas comes in bottles; the
                                    septic tank gurgles and belches knowingly, and happily looks after itself. The water?
                                    Yes, the water - and here I begin my tale.</p>
                                <p>
                                    My first water supply had been installed by the previous owners and involved a large
                                    tank some distance inland that was fed by small streams that wandered down the fellside.
                                    It was good to have a private supply that was free from any additives, and miles
                                    from any source of urban or industrial pollution. In time, and as I got older, the
                                    servicing of the installation began to be tedious, involving as it did clambering
                                    over stone walls when there was possibly ice or other hazards.
                                </p>
                                <p>And so I considered
                                    the possibility of a borehole on my own land. I was fortunate to find a dowser who
                                    lives not far away, who came with a cohort of children, and together we strode up
                                    and down my two fields. The dowser, Jack, had the traditional forked twig that he
                                    had pulled from the hedge, while the rest of us carried bundles of canes and followed
                                    close on his footsteps. Back and forth he walked, the twig dipping downwards from
                                    time to time while we ran to push in a cane at the spot.</p>
                                <p>
                                    In a comparatively short time, the pattern emerged of rows of canes that demonstrated
                                    the presence below each row of an aquifer. There were eight or nine all told, and
                                    all indicating the underground flow of water from the high ground toward the sea.
                                    One stood out from the rest, for as Jack approached, and was yet four or five metres
                                    off, the twig began to vibrate, and then shot downwards alarmingly as he came immediately
                                    above it. We plotted the course of this underground stream and were relieved to
                                    find that it deviated away from a neighbour's property, and was obviously not the
                                    source of his spring.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The arrival of the drilling rig and the sinking of the borehole provide material
                                    for a saga yet to be written, although I have told it often enough. It is still
                                    difficult to describe my relief and joy at seeing great jets of water soaring above
                                    the rig as the compressor did its work. The main aquifer is at twenty-five metres
                                    depth, and sits under clay and sandstone and on top of a bulk of granite - each
                                    layer in its way telling the story of past volcanic activity and glaciations. </p>
                                <p>
                                    "It's the best supply that we've found in the Lake District," said both the well-borer
                                    and the pump man - and for a county that seems to have more than its fair share
                                    of water, that is quite an accolade. It is the most beautiful water - cold from
                                    its underground sources, with just a hint of its mountain origins and sometimes
                                    a trace of iron from the ore beds that lie a short distance inland, and which were
                                    last worked in a very basic manner by long-dead miners several centuries ago.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Upstream, the aquifer passes under my boundary bank, or dyke as it is known locally,
                                    then below a narrow road and under the dyke that forms the boundary of my neighbour's
                                    land. His dyke has a hedge on top - except above the aquifer, where nothing grows.
                                    My boundary has a row of venerable pine trees, that stand tall - except where they
                                    grow or grew above other aquifers. One has died in my time here, another is quite
                                    stunted compared with the rest, and the one that had been planted directly above
                                    the main aquifer had grown in a strange way. From its base, it had grown almost
                                    parallel with the ground before finally directing itself upwards. The contorted
                                    shape became the tree's downfall, for, heavily burdened by wet snow, it was wrenched
                                    and twisted by winds and eventually came down in the field.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The trees and their history, together with my neighbour's hedge, provide me with
                                    an ever-present and visible demonstration of the existence of what have become generally
                                    known as "earth currents". Now, as I am writing, it is a warm and sunny day, and
                                    I have just come in from the field where I have spent some time lying on the ground
                                    directly above the aquifer. I did not really have to do that, for I already knew
                                    what I would feel, but I did it simply to add to the credibility of my account.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over many years, I have been made aware of the fact that I am very sensitive to
                                    the presence of electrical or electromagnetic fields and phenomena. It is difficult
                                    to quantify the effects - even to describe them in such a way that others can identify
                                    if they also are not similarly sensitive. Such words as "tingling" and "currents"
                                    come to mind, together with an inner sense of apprehension or disquiet.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The underground stream is a conductor of natural electricity. Its very movement
                                    may be the generating source of the current. The proximity upstream of the iron
                                    ore and the adjacent sandstone might create an electrical battery, the water providing
                                    both the electrolyte and the conductor.</p>
                                <p>
                                    "Earth currents" and "earth radiation" have become the accepted general terminology
                                    used in describing what is a real, identifiable and <em>measurable</em> phenomenon.
                                    More scientifically, they are called "telluric" currents, described below in Encyclopaedia
                                    Britannica. <span class="footnote">

                                        current flowing on and beneath the surface of the Earth and generally following
                                        a direction parallel to the Earth's surface. Telluric currents arise from charges
                                        moving to attain equilibrium between regions of differing electric potentials; these
                                        differences in potential are set up by several conditions, including very low-frequency
                                        electromagnetic waves from space, particularly from the magnetosphere incident upon
                                        the Earth's surface, and moving charged masses in the ionosphere and the atmosphere.
                                        Telluric currents are often used by geophysicists to map subsurface structures,
                                        such as sedimentary basins, layered rocks, and faults. An anomalous current density
                                        or gradient may be indicative of a subsurface structural feature."</p>

                                    Measurement requires precise and not very portable instrumentation and away from
                                    the scientific world recourse is more often made to the practice of dowsing or divining
                                    with the easily carried twig, rods or pendulum. It is most unfortunate that in some
                                    quarters, earth currents have been identified with another and completely different
                                    phenomenon, namely "ley lines". <span class="footnote">

                                    Ley lines are not earth currents; earth currents are not ley lines. The term "ley
                                    line" was coined by a man called Alfred Watkins, <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Watkins">

                                    in his book <i>The Old Straight Track</i>. They relate to the straight-line routes
                                    used by people in times long past, before the development of large towns and cities,
                                    before land was enclosed, before there was a network of roads and when travel was
                                    on foot or pony with pack animals or porters and the direct route was the most economical
                                    of effort.</p>

                                    One of my hobbies is to find and follow them in this wide-open country around my
                                    home, much of it never having seen the plough. I use a map, compass, rule and pencil,
                                    not dowsing rods or a pendulum, and the tracks can often be seen as the sun slants
                                    across a hillside, or a light powdering of snow settles differently on their surface
                                    compared with the surrounding terrain. Happy are the moments when I might come across
                                    a long disused ford or stepping stones, or find a series of mark stones that had
                                    guided feet from times long before the Romans came.</p>

                                    One unfortunate consequence of the association and confusion of earth currents with
                                    ley lines is that archaeologists, who could learn much from the alignment of the
                                    routes and the places that they once connected, become apoplectic at the mention
                                    of ley lines, while those practitioners who are involved in the provision of health
                                    care, ignore the phenomenon of the currents and their consequences for health, and
                                    dismiss the whole as so much hocus pocus.</p>
                                <p>
                                    It is not only the trees that suffer developmental and health problems when in the
                                    proximity of a current, although their behaviour and that of house plants can sometimes
                                    provide clues. <em>All</em> organic life may be affected, and the fact that plants
                                    and animals respond should be sufficient to demonstrate that health deterioration
                                    is real and not simply a subjective human reaction.

                                    The term "geopathic stress" has become the most commonly used general description
                                    of the result of persistent exposure to the electrical field associated with earth
                                    currents. Although the phenomenon has been known of in a number of parts of the
                                    world and in different eras, the first comprehensive description that I have found
                                    is in a book called <i>Earth Currents: Causative Factor of Cancer and Other Diseases</i>.
                                    The author, Gustav Freiherr von Pohl, provides many studies of the sleeping locations
                                    of individuals or families who had suffered serious, long-term ill health, the ailments
                                    being many and varied.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Apart from the more obvious of cancer and cardio-vascular conditions, the inclusion
                                    of instances of deteriorating mental health particularly concerned me within the
                                    context of my general writing.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I have mentioned my own sensitivity to electrical phenomena, and it was my own reactions
                                    that confirmed to me the involvement of geopathic stress in the illness and subsequent
                                    death of three whom I knew or got to know well. My cousin had developed very severe
                                    muscular rheumatism and had been given high doses of a steroid to relieve it. On
                                    one visit, and sitting in a room where I had not previously sat, I began to experience
                                    a very painful backache. Puzzled, for there was no obvious cause, I made an excuse
                                    and changed my seat, at which the pain declined.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I felt certain that the cause was some form of earth current, and as the room was
                                    that used most frequently by my cousin, with her bed immediately above, I have no
                                    doubt that the resultant stress led to her illness. Her diet of steroids had, however,
                                    proved to be too great, for her spine disintegrated, collapsed and she could breathe
                                    no more and died. Significantly, the dog belonging to a friend with whom my cousin
                                    shared the house, would not remain in the room in question, but left immediately
                                    if ever taken into it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The room in which the friend slept was subject to much less stress, but even so,
                                    she developed the most atrocious and unconscious habit of grinding her teeth. This
                                    latter is another indication of the existence of geopathic stress, and is unconscious
                                    and not subjective. Dogs detest these locations while cats seek them out - again,
                                    another potent indicator.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The behaviour of houseplants was an effective indicator of the stress at the head
                                    of the bed of one young woman whom I got to know. The plants deteriorated rapidly
                                    if placed on the bedside tables, and recovered if moved into other parts of the
                                    flat. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Esther had developed a malignant brain tumour from which she subsequently died.
                                    While she and her partner were together in the flat, one used to wake in deep depression
                                    with the feeling of a "heavy weight on the chest", while the other had frequent
                                    teeth-grinding nightmares. Esther moved back to her parents' home, and after treatment
                                    lived for a further year, succumbing eventually to meningitis. Her partner moved
                                    the bed within the room, and enjoyed relaxing sleep. My own reaction when I stood
                                    at the original bed head was to experience deep nausea.</p>
                                <p>
                                    There were no external signs in John's house, but the fact that I could not sleep
                                    in the bed in which he had slept formerly, alerted me to the fact that something
                                    was wrong. It was not, however, until someone actually dowsed the house that it
                                    was demonstrated that a "stress" line in fact ran the length of what had been John's
                                    side of the bed. The line went the full extent of the house, and crossed another,
                                    the crossing being beneath the location of his relaxation chair. After a long fight,
                                    and sustained by the utmost dedication of his wife, Vanessa, John sadly died of
                                    the leukaemia that he had contracted.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I have no way of knowing what precisely were the causes of these particular earth
                                    currents, for there are many possible driving forces. The earth is, in fact, a huge
                                    electrical machine. It has a magnetic core, and rotates within the stream of electrically
                                    charged particles that pour out from the sun in never ending flow, the "solar wind".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One characteristic of a rotating electrical machine is that it generates so-called
                                    "lines of force" over its surface, and that is just what occurs over the surface
                                    of the earth. There are two "grids" - the Hartmann and the Curry - and where they
                                    cross or interact with underground aquifers, zones or lines of geopathic stress
                                    are created. If the earth's surface were regular and homogeneous, perhaps not as
                                    many currents would flow, but it is this irregularity that, with other influences,
                                    creates the random configuration that is so hard to predict.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The variability and unpredictability of strength and direction of the grids and
                                    water generated currents become very apparent in the illustrations that accompany
                                    the case studies given in von Pohl's book.</p>
                                <p>
                                    A further collection may be seen in a book called <em>Earth Radiation</em> by K&auml;the
                                    (Katy) Bachler. The author, a schoolteacher in Austria, had trained as a dowser
                                    and had studied the phenomenon of earth currents and their relationship to problems
                                    of health. Also qualified in science and mathematics, Ms Bachler approached her investigations with the rigour
                                    of a scientist. She had become convinced that the erratic and unsocial behaviour
                                    of some children, and the underperformance of others, had its roots in geopathic
                                    stress experienced at school or home, or in both. Her proposed study was recognised
                                    by the Superintendent of the Schools District of Salzburg, and the Authority allowed
                                    her to pursue a full time investigation in the classrooms and the homes of many
                                    children.</p>
                                <p>
                                    It is impossible to supply detail of cases from either book in this limited essay
                                    - the books themselves are a small selection of many thousands. However, one conclusion
                                    that stemmed from the Bachler study was that children never sat in the same place
                                    for more than a month, but were moved around in the classroom at regular intervals.
                                    It is worth quoting briefly from the preface to the book that was written by the
                                    Superintendent.</p>
                                <blockquote>

                                        We now have the results of her work. This book is recommended for sceptics as well
                                        as supporters. Maybe they, too, will become convinced that there are indeed geopathic
                                        influences, and that by eliminating them, some people can be helped immeasurably.
                                        In particular, pupils and students can now become achievers in their studies."</p>

                                    There is a further introduction written by the then Archbishop of Salzburg, aimed
                                    at setting to rest any doubts that Christians might have about the use of dowsing.
                                    He warns against the use of dowsing for evil purposes and personal gain, but gives
                                    his blessing to those who use the gift for the benefit of others. The Archbishop
                                    concludes by "... warmly recommending to believing Christians the work of Ms. K&auml;the
                                    Bachler, and especially her book ..."</p>

                                    It is most unfortunate that both books are very hard to find, and are probably not
                                    in print. Anyone reading them may be struck by the fact that neither investigator
                                    talks about eliminating, removing or reversing the currents and their effects. Where,
                                    in the quotation above, the Superintendent writes of "eliminating them", he should,
                                    in fact, have written "avoiding them". The whole thrust of the work and analyses
                                    of both authors is to find <i>good</i> places for people to sleep and work in.

                                    Many to whom I have described these phenomena in the past make an immediate assumption
                                    that the whole house is a bad place. This is patently not so. In the case of John
                                    above, the lines were no more than a half metre wide. The zone in Esther's flat
                                    was solely at the bed head - plants that wilted when on the bedside tables flourished
                                    very healthily elsewhere, and the bed, when moved, provided a fully restful sleeping
                                    place. In the main, there are more good places than unhealthy ones.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I repeat what I wrote earlier, neither author suggests that the geopathic zones
                                    can be eliminated or "cured". I have been to "workshops" where one has been told
                                    of practices such as driving in wooden stakes, or copper pins. Others where individuals
                                    have claimed to "visualise" the zones away.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Rational thought and an appreciation of the causes and driving forces of the earth
                                    currents should convince most people that the areas and lines of stress cannot simply
                                    be "wished away". The aquifers beneath my fields have been flowing, probably without
                                    cease, since the last ice-age, and no action that I can think of will cause them
                                    to change direction or cease producing their electrical field. My house itself is
                                    almost completely benevolent, and I can understand why the site was chosen so many
                                    centuries ago.</p>

                                    Some aquifers are seasonal, and so dowsing on one occasion may provide a different
                                    result from that obtained on another. The Somerset Levels provide an interesting
                                    anomaly, because the direction of flow is governed by the state of the tide in the
                                    adjoining Bristol Channel. The tidal range is very great, and at high tide the pressure
                                    from the sea pushes the flow in the aquifer inland, while at low tide, the water
                                    is allowed to drain in the normal seaward direction.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Electrical currents are created in the stratospheric zones above the earth, and
                                    are transferred by a process known as induction into the plane of the earth below.
                                    Inevitably, these currents will be at their strongest in suitable conductors such
                                    as flowing water and in ore deposits, but as the currents are the result of the
                                    sun creating electrically charged particles in the ionosphere, they only exist during
                                    daylight hours. They are strongest at local noon, and die away at dusk. There are
                                    other major variables resulting from the movement of the moon and the changing seasons.</p>
                                <p>
                                    It has long been acknowledged that it is pointless trying to locate and evaluate
                                    earth currents at full and new moon, because of strong gravitational and other influences
                                    a these times.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Watching something as unlikely as a travel documentary crystallised this understanding
                                    for me. A group on men were exploring a particular region in the Australian outback
                                    where water is at a premium. They had stopped to fill up with water and petrol at
                                    a very remote store. As they were discussing with the store owner the additional
                                    availability of water further into the desert, he told them that in many locations
                                    the ground-water came to the surface at new and full moon i.e. in that very flat
                                    desert plain, the moon exerted a virtual tidal influence over the subterranean water.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The corollary of that is that wherever it occurred, water in underground aquifers
                                    would be subject to exactly the same influences, with a consequent effect upon any
                                    attendant earth currents.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What I am really trying to say is that dowsing and locating geoelectric zones and
                                    currents is not a simple and casual practice that can be picked up without considerable
                                    thought. Even though the process of dowsing with rods or a pendulum is easily demonstrated
                                    and many find that they can do it, that is not the end in itself.

                                    If one sets out to find the good or bad places in a house or place of work and thereby
                                    advise people, one is taking on a very serious responsibility. The case studies
                                    of both Ms. Bachler and von Pohl relate to many grave and life-threatening illnesses,
                                    and also to those normally classed as "mental", and both worked in consultation
                                    with the appropriate physician. It is interesting to note this acceptance and collaboration
                                    coming from the medical profession and the Church in central Europe. In Britain,
                                    there is almost universal scepticism, or downright ridicule.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The tendency to ridicule stems in no small part from the influences that I mentioned
                                    earlier - namely the desire of many to look for mystical associations and, through
                                    the confusion with leylines, linkages with such places as stone circles and ancient
                                    sites. The use of the term "geomancer" is calculated to reinforce the "magic and
                                    mystery" (although, in truth, I cannot understand why anyone would use that term
                                    in this context. Geomancy is the method of divination that interprets the random
                                    shapes that appear in earth that is thrown onto a surface, and later, it is the
                                    interpretation of a collection of dots randomly made on paper).

                                    There is nothing magical about earth currents, nor the geopathy associated with
                                    them. It takes a small amount of science to understand how the phenomena develop,
                                    but it takes a lot of realism and dedication to use the knowledge for the benefit
                                    of sick people.</p>

                                    In Britain, one of the most dedicated individuals in this field is Rolf Gordon.
                                    His son died from cancer, and Rolf is certain that the root cause was the geopathic
                                    stress experienced by his son where the latter slept. Apart from writing a very
                                    useful and practical book, <em>Are You Sleeping In A Safe Place?</em>, Rolf founded
                                    the Dulwich Health Society with the aim of disseminating knowledge and of promoting
                                    the use of what appears to be the one device available that can minimise the local
                                    effect of geopathic currents. The device, called a "Raditech", is plugged into the
                                    electrical mains in the house and, based on what is called a "Lakowsky coil", it
                                    generates a neutralising field.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyone believing that this is just a bit more hocus-pocus, may be interested in
                                    this simple anecdote: I supplied one of these units to some friends to use in their
                                    house where there were several geopathic zones. The much older mother who had lived
                                    all of her life in this same house, but who knew nothing of the new device, descended
                                    the stairs the next morning with the remark that she had just had the best night's
                                    sleep that she had ever had since childhood.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The effects upon mental and nervous health are often quite difficult to assess,
                                    for they can be complex in that the dividing line between the actual physical effects
                                    of the geopathic stress and the resultant subjective reactions may become blurred.
                                    At the simplest level, a physical <em>feeling</em> equivalent to that experienced
                                    during times of apprehension may be created in a person. Even though there may be
                                    nothing in the person's life actually to cause worry, the constant feeling of being
                                    worried may engender a permanent state of anxiety for which medical help may then
                                    be sought.</p>
                                <p>
                                    On a personal level, I can only speculate about the very first home of my parents.
                                    It was built on land that had been reclaimed from freshwater marsh that drained
                                    into an inlet of the sea close by, with the possibility of water movement continuing
                                    to occur beneath it. In giving birth to my brother in the house, my mother came
                                    close to dying from a haemorrhage that followed his birth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My brother cried incessantly, and was often pacified only when beneath overhanging
                                    trees. Both the failure of blood to clot, and the incessant crying of infants are
                                    key symptoms of the existence of geopathic stress. There are many cases recorded
                                    of infants cramming to one side or end of their cot in their efforts to avoid the
                                    source of their distress, or perhaps sleep-walking or seeking the bed of a sibling
                                    or parents.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I am acquainted with one child from before the time that I first became aware of
                                    these phenomena, which cried incessantly when put in its cot, and struggled so hard
                                    in its distress that it developed a hernia. His mother's character changed markedly
                                    while living in this particular mobile home. The child became pacified and the mother
                                    her normal self when shortly they moved to a new dwelling. The reaction of my brother
                                    when beneath the trees is a possible confirmation of the electrical nature of all
                                    that I am considering, for it is well known that certain trees are one of the many
                                    sources of negative ions (electrically charged particles) and that these are necessary
                                    for normal health and development.</p>
                                <p>
                                    One consequence of the nature of certain geopathic zones is that they have been
                                    shown to create an excess of positive over negative ions. Wide research has demonstrated
                                    that the reverse ratio is essential for harmonious life and development. This, however,
                                    is a much wider topic and beyond what I intend in this essay.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Again, I can only speculate on the possibility that where my brother and sister-in-law
                                    slept there was a geopathic zone. The fact that both developed cancer within a comparatively
                                    short time of each other, and that my brother later had a minor stroke, makes me
                                    think that it is probably so - a number of writers on the topic assert most definitely
                                    that in virtually every case of cancer that they have investigated, there has been
                                    the presence of geopathic elements.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Further speculation was fuelled in my mind when I read his <i>Memoirs</i>, by the former
                                    Foreign Secretary, Lord Hurd. He described his choice of his present home, and the
                                    fact that when he and Lady Hurd first inspected it they found running water below
                                    the floorboards in one room. Also in the book are two illustrations - one of Lady
                                    Hurd during her recovery from leukaemia, juxtaposed with a view of the house, which
                                    stands alongside a seasonal stream. The association of water flow and cancer really
                                    hit me when I came to that part of the book.</p>
                                <p>
                                    There is however, no room for speculation in the instances of two families with
                                    which I am well acquainted.</p>

                                    Morag and Jock, plus children Tom and Amy. Morag developed breast cancer, and after
                                    appropriate treatment was beginning to recover, when a colon cancer was discovered.
                                    Husband Jock has suffered depression for some time and has not worked for several
                                    years. The illnesses can be traced back to when they moved into their current house.

                                    I refer you. Jock invariably woke in a state of deep depression, but did not do
                                    so when he slept in a bed in bedroom 4.

                                    The better quality of sleep that Jock is now getting with the device installed,
                                    has helped him to cope with the personal tragedy now unfolding, and to devote full

                                    Maggie, Ben and daughter Ruth moved into their present home approximately five years
                                    ago. In that short time, Maggie has had a hysterectomy, suffered a period of clinical
                                    depression and developed breast cancer. Ben had a recurrence of a psychiatric problem
                                    that was well controlled, has deserted Maggie, and they are now divorced. Ruth changed
                                    from a reasonably compliant early teenager into a belligerent and non-cooperative
                                    person.
                                </p>

                                    Without then realising the implications (for the scan is very recent), Maggie had
                                    moved her Bed 1 from the disaster zone to the one clear area of her bedroom. With
                                    appropriate treatment, she has fully recovered from the breast cancer, and has recovered
                                    from the deep depression that had threatened to end her employment. Since receiving
                                    the scan of the geopathic zones, Ruth has been persuaded to move her Bed 2 to a
                                    clear area, and as this has happened only within the last fortnight, it is not yet
                                    possible to assess her reactions.</p>

                                    Finally, I have only recently been made aware of a remarkable development in the
                                    fortunes of one particular family following their change of house. The father, (A),
                                    is the brother of one of my close friends who has regularly commented upon the circumstances
                                    and health of his brother, and the state of his marriage.</p>
                                <p>
                                    "A" had inexplicable blackouts from time to time, and had a marriage in name only,
                                    the union being maintained essentially for the children. The wife, as reported,
                                    behaved like a virago, and refused normal relations. One child suffered from petit
                                    mal, while his sister had psychological problems.
                                </p>

                                    Following the change of houses which occurred three or four months ago, there have
                                    been no instances of the problems of "A" or his son that would have been expected
                                    in that time, and the son's medication has been greatly reduced, and will soon be
                                    stopped; "A" and his wife have resumed normal marital relations, while the young
                                    girl is appearing to be free from the stresses that were at the root of her previous
                                    condition.

                                    Cancers and other physical illnesses are the ones most often cited when describing
                                    the effects of exposure to geopathic influences. Equally important because of their
                                    increasing prevalence and often devastating consequences, are the "cancers of the
                                    mind" - the clinical depressions, anxiety states and other serious nervous and psychiatric
                                    illnesses, and the non-specific behavioural problems in children.
                                </p>

                                    Esther and her partner between them had "deep depression" on waking after night-time
                                    "teeth grinding nightmares". Jock habitually awoke depressed when in the marital
                                    bed, but had refreshing sleep in a bed that is free from geopathic influence. Maggie
                                    developed clinical depression and Ben suffered aggravation of a controlled psychiatric
                                    condition, while Ruth underwent a change in personality in their new home. Personality
                                    change followed my friend's daughter moving into a particular dwelling, while her
                                    infant son became greatly distressed when in his cot - both improving after removing
                                    to a different home.</p>

                                    K&auml;the Bachler's findings are so very relevant in the face of wide ranging "social"
                                    problems that are occurring in our schools. Disruption, indiscipline, attention
                                    deficit are some of the possible consequences of children sitting for long periods
                                    in geopathically stressed zones. Unfortunately the existence of geopathic illness
                                    is not generally accepted in Britain, and the ever-ready fix-it drug is available
                                    as the panacea to cure all ills when often all that is required is the relocation
                                    of the bed or sitting place. Cost free remedies, without side-effects - and remarkably
                                    successful.

                                            In his introduction Watkins wrote: "My main theme is the alignment across miles
                                            of country of a great number of objects, or sites of objects, of prehistoric antiquity.
                                            And this is not in one or a few instances, but in scores or hundreds. Such alignments
                                            are either facts beyond the possibility of accidental coincidence or they are not.
                                            These lines of necessity include, and mix up in the first place, human efforts and
                                            place-names of widely different periods of time; it is the task of other branches
                                            of archaeology to work out the full chronology of the matter, and I only attempt
                                            those few obvious deductions as regards periods which the mechanism of the sighted
                                            track reveal. ... One definition seems to be needed. A trackway is a path across
                                            country for man and horse, often with no more structure than made by the users'
                                            feet, but perhaps stoned or "pitched" in soft places. My subject is not that of
                                            Roman roads."</p>

                                            constellations, one's lifestyle, a bad diet and infections. Many of these factors
                                            can be eliminated once recognised. In addition, there are other environmental factors
                                            less familiar to most people, such as the influences from the earth itself - that
                                            is geopathic influences. I want to report about geopathic influences, since very
                                            few facts and conclusions have been presented in this area. Yet it would be of great
                                            value for people to know more about them. Much energy could be preserved, much suffering
                                            alleviated, much emotional turmoil eased, and many people could lead a useful and
                                            happy life if those damaging influences could be removed from their lives." "It
                                            is my sincere desire that the realisations on which this book is based will be instrumental
                                            in giving help and hope to many people who have suffered from illness and depressions.
                                            I am thinking especially of children who are unable to bring about change without

                                            there were steps being taken to organise reprints.

                                            The Author's son died of cancer in 1985. He subsequently found that at one stage
                                            his son's bed had been located over a strong underground vein of water. "I only
                                            realised later the harmful effect of geopathic stress, caused by these underground
                                            veins of water, must have had on my son's health, and I immediately decided to investigate.
                                            I found to my astonishment that considerable research had been carried out in Germany
                                            over the last 50 years, which supported the theory THAT ONE IS UNLIKELY TO DEVELOP
                                            CANCER UNLESS ONE HAS SLEPT OR STAYED FOR LONG PERIODS OVER HARMFUL EARTH RAYS.
                                            One doctor, Dr. Hagar of Stettin, has found the theory borne out in 5,348 cases.
                                            Equally this was shown to be the case in respect of most other serious illnesses.</p>

                                            "Why, I ask myself, is so little known about the harmful effects of earth radiation
                                            on health? The answer must lie in the mystique surrounding them (they have only
                                            recently been measured according to the established laws of physics), the scarcity
                                            of published evidence in the English language and the consequent refusal of literally
                                            (sic) minded people to believe in such phenomena and because so few people are aware
                                            of the dangers or can locate the currents accurately".
