									A few pages ago I suggested that you should re-read the earlier part of my writing
									in which I described the events leading up to the moment in which I began to "hear
									voices" and experience other phenomena. Recollect that I had not sought any spiritual
									contact, nor had I been seeking "divination" or converse with the dead. I had simply
									followed what at the time seemed to be a logical progression from the reality of
									dowsing using bent metal rods, to a point where I had perfectly rational conversations
									in which I engaged silently within my mind and I received responses - <i>reasoned</i>
									and logical responses - via a pendulum and alphabet chart. Thus, "characters" had
									emerged, one of whom was alleged to be a former, and now deceased, Buddhist priest.
									In "conversations" with him I became aware of a separate phenomenon, namely that
									of "ambience". At those times, I was imbued with and surrounded by an inexplicable
									and indescribable feeling of the sanctity and spiritual demeanour of someone of
									deep personal spirituality.</p>
								<p>
									By itself, this type of encounter did not totally prepare me for the experience
									of having my entire person intruded into. As I have described earlier, I sat in
									my quiet room, as had been suggested in conversations via the pendulum, and began
									to compose myself for a simple meditative stillness. Totally unexpectedly, and without
									drama, "a presence moved from the space in front of me <i>into</i> me". From
									that time onward, I have never been free from intrusive physical presences - not
									manifest all the time, but frequently, and with potentially significant effect upon
									my demeanour and reaction.</p>
								<p> My older brother is an Anglican priest. Completely independently,
									and not discussed or even mentioned until I had my own experiences and described
									them to him, my brother has had experience of spiritual "movement" within himself
									since his late teens. He has had a full and active prayer life since those days,
									and he related to me how, when composing himself for prayer, or during the Eucharist,
									he sometimes senses bodily activity. He simply says within his mind - "If you are
									from God, you are welcome: if not, please go".
								</p>
								<p>
									Not, myself, having my brother's spiritual acceptance, and he not having had the
									trauma of my experiences of spiritual malevolence, our reactions are markedly different.
									I do not <i>want</i> this type of activity within myself, from any source, unless
									I will it. Consequently, I view <i>any</i> intrusion with hostility and deep resentment.
									Over the years I have identified and recorded a number of "ploys" used by intrusive
									spirits, and try in my accounts to describe the indescribable - often by analogy,
									as in the following:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										It is all too easy to dwell upon the presence of the voice intrusions. Far more
										insidious, and possibly ever present, is the mute <i>physical</i> "overlap". Try
										to imagine a not quite exact "fit", so that in every movement or reaction there
										is just the little bit of anticipation or lag; of speeding up when it is inappropriate;
										of not being quite in phase on a turn; of causing forward movement when there are
										obstacles to be negotiated - whether by deliberate intent or lack of "skill" it
										is impossible to say. When the presence is continuous, or frequently in and out,
										it can become positively loathsome and one longs to be rid of it.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you have a copy, read in the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i> the story of the
										<i>Old Man of the Sea</i>. Sinbad, shipwrecked and alone as usual, stumbles across
										an old man who asks for his help to cross a stream. Sinbad, in his kindness, takes
										the old man on his back, and then, when the stream is crossed, finds himself in
										a stranglehold; beaten about the head, made to go this way and that, by day and
										night, at the old man's whim; be-skittered and be-pissed all down his back and generally
										befouled. It is only ultimately by making some wine from wild grapes and getting
										the man drunk that Sinbad is finally freed, and one can sense the ultimate release
										as he crushes the man's skull with a boulder. <i>Many times have I wished for that boulder</i>!
										It is possible from one's own reactions to these presences to understand how it
										is that individuals will harm themselves in an effort to get at or get rid of this
										gross intrusion that is only reachable within their own body.
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									Next, a very simple but effective ploy - (in all of the ploys that I shall describe,
									"<i>they</i>" refers to the intrusion or intrusions - it is impossible to know at
									any time whether there is one or more involved in the current activity):
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										<i>They</i> can intrude physically and mentally into one's every moment, delighting
										in creating emotions or exploiting potentially emotional situations, until one realises
										that attempts are made to create laughter or tears where one is not in the least
										stirred up in either direction sufficiently to laugh or cry. Similarly, if the situation
										arose, <i>they</i> could create a feeling of anger and supply the words to go with
										it in a ready flow. <i>They</i> intrude into one's every thought and action, including
										the most intimate.
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									One just longs for an empty space in one's mind where one can think one's own thoughts,
									enjoy one's own emotions and reminiscences without these intrusions. One develops
									the most intense hatred of <i>them</i>. One result of this barrage is that one resents
									<i>any</i> intrusion or contact, thus rendering suspect those that might originate
									from a desirable spiritual source - <i>they</i> simulate these as well, so as to
									create animosity in one's mind to potential or existing spiritual helpers.

								<p class="part-number">Part 2</p>
								<p>
									Another, and somewhat different, example of a mute but explicit physical intrusion
									occurred as follows:
								</p>
								<p>
									On one occasion, a female friend who was visiting asked me to help her to accomplish
									something personal and intimate that she could not achieve because of the difficulties
									of simultaneously looking and reaching. Having been married more than once, and
									having brought up a daughter and stepdaughter, I have no problem or embarrassment
									with female anatomy or exposure, but while I was delicately preoccupied, I felt
									an intrusion, or more specifically, a subtle <i>insinuation</i> into myself. Almost
									immediately, I was suffused by <i>someone else's</i> embarrassment, and <i>female</i>
									embarrassment at that. "Who" had been persuaded to intrude and by "whom", and under
									what pretext, I have obviously no way of knowing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Physical intrusions can and do occur at any time and the differing intensities and
									variety are so great that is difficult to be specific. One example can occur when
									I am woodcarving.
								</p>
								<p>
									At these times there can appear within me a "heavy" intruding presence with a "working"
									mouth of concentration and with laboured breathing - the conclusion being that someone
									"in spirit" is trying to experience what they did not achieve in life. There is
									also the implication at other times that someone formerly skilled in life wants
									to impart that skill. This can present one with a difficult choice. There are or
									have been many musicians, composers, artists, writers and others who have freely
									acknowledged that they cannot produce their finest work unless their "Muse" is present
									within them, and many and great are the works that have been produced. (See <i>The Unknown
										Guest</i> by Brian Inglis; also listen to the accounts given by concert pianist
									John Lill of his own experiences of spiritual presences that have occurred during
									his own public performances.)
								</p>
								<p>
									By contrast, I do not want to be "taken over" - I want to work out my own problems
									and then want the sheer pleasure of, first of all, visualising, and then, creating
									my own art or craft. I do not want to be the vehicle through which "someone" operates
									vicariously and, in doing so, takes away the pleasures of my own originality and
									craft skills.</p>
								<p>
									I once had a very good sculpture and carving teacher who gave advice on concepts
									and techniques, but did not attempt to influence one's individual expression; nor
									did he touch the work unless asked to demonstrate, but was always there with advice
									if asked. Above all, he inspired immense confidence, and could rescue one from the
									most depressing artistic disasters.</p>
								<p>
									This, by extension, is what one would hope for from desirable spiritual associates.
									Having done much to my house by way of development, and not having had craft training
									or much DIY experience, I have, nevertheless, been given much help by inspiration,
									in ways and on occasions that are too numerous to detail. It, however, helps me
									to make the point that there is much support and knowledge available, but it is
									received at a much, much deeper level than the other phenomena about which I am
									writing - virtually subliminally.</p>
								<p>
									There can be a very great danger in accepting a "Muse" into one's person. It can
									often be represented or inferred that this is the spirit of someone who, for example,
									was formerly a well known artist or musician. The belief that one has been chosen
									by this "famous person" can be very flattering, but if it became continuous, one
									could gradually lose one's own identity and capacity for originality.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once, while working on my private water supply, which is isolated and completely
									hidden from view, I was caused to fall by a "wrestle"*. This effectively demonstrated,
									and was confirmed by implication, that I could be made to fall and be injured anywhere,
									with no chance of summoning help (or to fall in a dangerous location e.g. in front
									of a train or vehicle). It was then impressed upon me that I should always plan
									where I was going and what I was going to do, and that if I was going to be alone
									in an isolated location, I should ensure that someone was aware of where I could
									be found. It was further impressed on me that I would get immense help and protection
									if there was forethought in all my actions - that if I wanted to draw from the spiritual
									help which is always available, I should prepare beforehand for such activities
									as studying or giving healing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Although the purpose of this incident was benevolent and aimed at informing me for
									my own protection, I have included it here because it illustrates more than one
									aspect of what I am trying to convey. Earlier in my writing, I related how my body
									was manipulated physically with great skill. I am recalling it now to reinforce
									what I am trying to convey, namely the physical powers and skills of the "intruders",
									whether they be benevolent or malevolent. Secondly, during this and the earlier
									happenings, there was no mental "voice" communication. Entirely and fully, all that
									flowed did so at the deep subliminal level of "concepts".</p>
								<p>
									On another occasion, when I was walking between my house and workshop, I was physically
									"gutted"*, for want of a better word. This was completely spontaneous and without
									explanation - none was needed, for the meaning was obvious. It was as if a hand
									had reached in and torn out my solar plexus. Physical recovery came quite quickly,
									but the mental shock and implication stayed with me for much longer.
								</p>
								<p>
									On yet another occasion, when playing a game of rounders or cricket in my field
									with some nephews and nieces, I was running vigorously for the ball, when, suddenly,
									my legs were "kicked"* from under me and I fell heavily. It was equivalent to the
									most blatant foul I had ever experienced when playing rugby at school or in the
									Navy.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>*</b> From time to time, I re-read what I have written, and I am always conscious
									of the number of times when I have been forced to place quote marks around a word
									or phrase that I have used in trying to describe the indescribable - as in the three
									instances at * above. On no occasion was there a visible agent through whom the
									effects had been engineered, although, on the third occasion, my fall was very public
									and the result of what I can only describe as a vicious attack.
								</p>
								<p>
									The experiences that I have drawn on so far, or that I shall go on to describe,
									have occurred over more than twenty years, and continue to happen in one form or
									another. Throughout that time, I have kept notes of events as they took place, and
									have them with me now. I hope that in my writing I have shown myself to be capable
									of lucid communication. People with whom I come into contact treat me as an intelligent,
									"normal" person who has a wide-ranging intellect; someone to whom a number come
									for advice on a range of topics; someone who is regarded as a good communicator.
									Yet, in spite of these personal qualifications, I am having the greatest difficulty
									in describing my experiences in such a manner that I will succeed in convincing
									anyone - particularly the sceptical, the determined "unbelievers" - of their truth.

								<div class="centering-clear">
								</div>
								<p>
									I find that I can continue to write most effectively by the use of analogy and by
									drawing upon my own personal experiences, although, in this instance, they are experiences
									gained in everyday life and several years before the beginning of the "voice intrusions".

								<p>
									Some time after the collapse of my first marriage, I took the plunge again and married
									a widow who had two teenage children. By nature, I am an optimistic person, looking
									for the positive in a relationship, and, probably na&iuml;vely, not looking ahead
									to the possibility of incompatibility or of serious dissent. Thus the prospect of
									sharing my newly acquired home and its four acres of land with someone who had similar
									interests in horses and the development of a smallholding, seemed to have a lot
									going for it. With my guard totally down, I made my newly acquired family completely
									free of the establishment and facilities in an endeavour to let them integrate totally,
									and feel wanted. </p>
								<p>
									Without going into detail, in a short time I found myself overwhelmed. With their
									own lines of communication well established, I found that preferences were being
									decided and acted upon in a manner which excluded me from the process, with the
									result that gradually I began to feel submerged and almost an alien in my own home.
									Worst of all was to have one's every action observed and analysed, and possibly
									commented upon or reported back. Remarks such as "<i>I</i> wouldn't do it that way"
									began to intrude: "The person who taught <i>me</i> to drive ..." or similar comments
									were delivered in a manner that always presumed the superiority, or personal "omniscience"
									of the lady.</p>
								<p>
									The result was that very soon I found myself, at almost all times, living in anticipation
									of some remark or action that reflected or rebounded upon what I may have said or
									done. I had the constant inward feeling akin to "looking over my shoulder", in expectation
									of some sort of intervention. In extreme instances, it was possible to find oneself
									unable to think a plan through or to make a rational decision, and even, as a result,
									to come to a total and dithering stop. These and similar reactions (or lack of actions)
									might occur even when the antagonising influence was not actually present, but in
									the offing or about to return. I sought isolation and longed for the "space" and
									independence for my own thoughts and actions, free from observation and comment;
									free from the intruding voice and presence.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many individuals, either by choice, or unwittingly, place themselves in situations
									in which "voices and presences" intrude into their minds and bodies - indeed, some
									actively seek the voices and presences. Reflect that, unsuspectingly, without guile,
									but gullibly, and without anticipating any adverse consequences, through the use
									of my pendulum and alphabet chart, I was completely taken over, and my mind and
									life were totally dominated - until eventually I was able to break free. What, initially,
									had appeared to be a desirable development in my life, soon became a dominating
									influence. I had not been seeking spiritual enlightenment, or any esoteric practices,
									whereas many individuals do have such goals.</p>
								<p>
									The "seeker" may, for example, join a workshop with the aim of becoming a "channeller"
									of enlightenment and truth from "ascended masters", and be delighted at the arrival
									within of an inner voice and presence. Another might enrol for instruction in Reiki,
									and receive "empowerment" or "atunemet" from some (presumed) spiritual source. Others
									may follow the directions given in the writings of the Simontons or similar authors
									and endeavour to find their "inner guides". Some might go through a process of "past
									life regression" under hypnosis and emerge convinced that they have their former
									persona "who" speaks through them. Yet others might seek the inner "atunements"
									to be reached through deep meditation practices - indeed they might work diligently
									at the practices with the objective of achieving, or contacting <i>sidhis</i> (depending
									upon the meaning each might give to the word).</p>
								<p>
									Some seekers are well integrated mentally and spiritually, and are introduced to
									their chosen practice with care and control. Others may be "opened" spiritually
									in a rash or incompetent manner, and may become the victims of undesirable intrusions
									into their bodies and minds. (Once again quoting Dr. Elmer Greene when he writes
									of the perils of a hasty descent into the deeper realms of the mind: "The persistent
									explorer in these realms ... brings himself to the attention of indigenous beings
									...").
								</p>
								<p>
									The arrival of the voice in the mind and the presence within the body, may be instant
									and very obvious, as they were in my case, or they may appear as if by subtle and
									gentle infusion over time, in such a way that the "host" may never be sure <i>when</i>
									they actually arrived, or, indeed, whether they had always been present. With the
									awareness that there is, seemingly, a powerful spiritual or "different" influence
									in ones life, it is possible that one feels flattered at being chosen, particularly
									as a feeling of "warm solicitousness" may be being created simultaneously. As within
									the analogous situation of my second marriage, it is difficult to be certain subsequently
									<i>when</i> things began to change - when the presence and association once welcome
									and sought, became so <i>un</i>welcome, aggravating and dominating.
								</p>
								<p>
									Analogies can be taken too far, and then cease to be useful, yet, nevertheless,
									the changes that I have used my former marriage to illustrate, do occur, sometimes
									over a period of time - sometimes within the span of a day, as in the following
									example that I have recorded.
								</p>
								<p>
									The moment of waking, or the time of gradually emerging awareness after sleep, is
									most crucial, for one is then at one's most vulnerable. One's first thoughts at
									these times are "answered"; indeed, it might seem that one is already in a conversation.
									It is exceedingly difficult to avoid responding, and a dialogue can ensue from which
									it is hard to break free. There can be a feeling created on waking, a sense of being
									with very gentle spiritual people, warm, welcoming and caring. It is so easy to
									slip into this ambience, particularly if the rest of one's life is bleak or fraught.</p>
								<p>
									<i>But</i>, as one is starting to feel "cosy" and cared for, they start to imply
									that there are one or two, oh-so-teeny, defects that need correcting before one
									can be truly accepted and enjoy this ambience and ultimately be accepted into it
									after death. Gradually the emphasis shifts becoming more needling and ultimately
									threatening. One's defects become grossly magnified, one's sense of unworthiness
									exaggerated, and all the earlier warmth totally disappears.
								</p>
								<p>
									Sometimes an intrusion can be of such a cold, inhuman presence that one can feel
									oneself to be totally devoid of humanity, of love, of caring. <i>One could become either
										very ill or very evil</i>.</p>
								<p>
									It is virtually impossible for anyone in this state to convey to another the sense
									of threat or terror that can be experienced at these times. This inability to communicate
									can so increase a person's sense of loneliness, of total isolation, that they can
									easily try to seek oblivion in drink or drugs or suicide - indeed, it is quite possible
									that in their mind they will be actively encouraged down some desperate or diabolical
									route.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is some time since I experienced this particular type of ploy, although the memory
									never fades. While my own experiences were long ago and intermittent, I was once
									briefly acquainted with a woman for whom similar and worse ones were a daily occurrence.
									Married with two young children of school age, her days began inside the warm "cocoon"
									of the mind and the ambience of a benevolent spiritual presence. With the husband
									at work and the children at school, the warmth and gentleness of the voices and
									presences changed significantly, and she was accused of being an incompetent and
									wicked mother whose children were in danger of being corrupted by evil.
								</p>
								<p>
									She was told that she should kill the children and then herself in order to escape
									from the evil that surrounded them, and to ensure that they all would be secure
									spiritually. Each day saw her cowering in a corner with the curtains drawn, subjected
									to constant abuse and torments, until about mid-afternoon, when the agony gradually
									ceased, the curtains were drawn back, and the children welcomed home. All would
									be peace - until the next morning, when the omissions of the previous day would
									be piled onto the long and growing list of her incompetences and inadequacies.</p>
								<p>
									The person was an active, practicing Christian, the minister of whose church lived
									less than fifty yards away, unable, seemingly, to help. I talked to him on one occasion
									when I visited a friend who lived nearby, and tried to interest him in my experiences,
									and their relevance to the situation of his parishioner. I might just as well have
									saved my breath, for like so many in the Christian ministry today, he had come under
									the spell of modern psychiatry and psychology, and believed all that was said about
									voice hearing, schizophrenia, and the efficacy of modern drugs in controlling the
									condition. Instead of asking, exploring, trying to learn more, this man was more
									interested in trying to analyse <i>me</i>, and in putting me in a "category" that
									would explain <i>my</i> alleged experiences.
								</p>
								<p>
									I can only comment from the standpoint of someone who has been a lifelong Christian,
									and can only speculate that people of other faiths might have their religious beliefs
									and observances used and turned against them as they strive for the perfections
									that their religion advocates. One fruitful hunting ground for intruding spirits
									is the highly charged, emotional setting of a religious gathering, where the charismatic
									appeal of the speaker can cause individuals to drop their inhibitions or controls
									and open themselves wide to a hoped-for spiritual manifestation, or "conversion".
								</p>
								<p>
									The huge appeal of the moment; the wonderful feeling of being "born-again"; the
									dramatic reaction to being "slain by the spirit", can all conspire to make the sensitive,
									susceptible ones believe that they have been "chosen". They can feel numinous presences
									within or around them, and rejoice at the inner voice that tells them that they
									are one of an elect band and that they will "purified", and, when pure, will be
									allowed close and personal contact with the "ultimate" - that, if pure, they may
									even be chosen to "channel" wisdom and truths. In the joy of having been accepted
									into this inner circle, it is so easy for the susceptible to lose all sense of discernment
									and to immerse themselves completely within this newly revealed inner world.</p>
								<p>
									Undoubtedly there are many spiritual locations and gatherings from which people
									return uplifted, inspired and renewed - locations and gatherings where, often by
									long association, there is spiritual guardianship and protection. There are, however,
									undoubtedly others, where the speaker and venue are used to draw the vulnerable,
									susceptible, and where their weaknesses can be seen and exploited spiritually. I
									am fully aware that many have great difficulty even in accepting the reality of
									a spiritual state and of the existence of individually acting spirits. </p>
								<p>
									I am equally aware of the much greater difficulty that the concept of the reality
									of spiritual evil and of <i>intelligent</i>, individually acting spirits presents.
									I have long ago given up any attempts to convince anyone who is determined <i>not</i>
									to accept any of this; but even these readers, if they truly have the welfare of
									suffering individuals at heart, should consider what I am writing, and, if nothing
									else, use my experiences and observations as "patterns" to be held against these
									individuals to see if any fit.</p>
								<p>
									To return to ones who have been "entered" and inspired, and who now believe that
									they are to be purified and "used" - by whom? Do they question? I did not - I was
									gullibility personified - <i>because I had no reason to doubt what I was being told,
										through the pendulum, or in my mind</i>! </p>
								<p>
									Remember, I was alone, with no one with whom to share my experiences or from whom
									I might have received counsel and caution. Indeed, one ploy that might be used is
									one in which <i>they</i> gradually encourage isolation, advising that friends and
									associates are not "worthy" to share in the new experiences, and that all inner
									voice contact would be better served by the hearer withdrawing into a more solitary
									life. Within the new world of increasing solitude and isolation, the victim, without
									realising it, is more vulnerable and open to suggestion. Thus, it might be proposed
									that a prayer regime should be established, which gradually might become more severe
									as an indication of inner piety - possibly involving waking and praying through
									the night. Different forms of asceticism, such as diet restriction, may be suggested
									strongly.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										[ Let me remind you of my earlier description of the arguments and propositions that
										were put to me, and let me also recall that at the time I felt no strain or overt
										pressure - all appeared logical and desirable, and it was all achieved as the <i>result
											of discourse in my mind</i>. This is what I wrote:</p>
									<p>
										"... nevertheless, there was strong argument that I should become morally impeccable,
										but that I should not choose a philosophy or religious affiliation because it allowed
										a degree of moral latitude. It was put to me that as, at an earlier time, I had
										elected to be a Catholic, I should 'return to the fold', or, if not, then my rejection
										should be for sound reasons of belief, and not because I was looking for a path
										with less exacting moral standards.</p>
									<p>
										I was encouraged to adopt a sincere prayer life and spent long periods in prayer
										each night ..." ]
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									With each acceptance of a new devotion or stringency, the victim is creating levers
									that may be used to torment him. If he should default on any of his commitments,
									<i>they</i> will seize upon and try to exploit even the most minor peccadillo, or
									even a supposed one, and make it become an obsession beyond all reason, while at
									the same time creating a physical ambience of censoriousness. <i>They</i> might
									even propose a more severe asceticism as a form of penance to restore his spiritual
									standing.
								</p>
								<p>
									The feeling created, of unworthiness and censure, can overshadow the brightest company
									or activity, almost as if there was a sentence hanging over one - reminiscent of
									when, in my past serious depression, there existed a feeling of "gut hollowness"
									that totally prevented one's enjoyment and development, much as I imagine the presence
									of a cancer within one's body might do.
								</p>
								<p>
									Within the major religions, many do spend time in isolation, or engage in stringent
									ascetic practices, but they do so <i>within</i> a "control group", having checks
									and balances and spiritual advisors, together with a long tradition upon which to
									draw, and an understanding of the potential dangers of such activities. (Recollect
									the "Rules for the discernment of spirits" given by St. Ignatius of Loyola, the
									founder of the Jesuit Order, to which I referred earlier in my writing).</p>
								<p>
									Within the context of self-purification, the hearer is encouraged to dredge his
									mind and to bring to the surface any - usually long past - events or thoughts of
									an embarrassing, shameful or similar nature, especially if others are involved.
									<i>They</i> will encourage recollection of incidents in which others - family, friends,
									- showed up badly, especially reminiscences about known or imagined (and usually,
									sexual) peccadilloes.
								</p>
								<p>
									They might next pretend that the persons themselves are present in spirit and are
									aware of the thoughts, and that one will be confronted with the consequences of
									these unnecessary revelations that should have been allowed to pass into history,
									when one dies oneself. In this context, <i>they</i> will insert into one's mind
									a name that is calculated to produce reminiscences from the past - often the name
									of someone with whom one has been close or intimate - always trawling the mind,
									encouraging recollections, particularly of a sexual nature.</p>
								<p>
									Yet again, a "heavy" presence, purporting to be a senior spiritual figure, may introduce
									the concept that someone (deceased) does, or will wish to apologise for lifetime's
									hurts. This is calculated to cause one to go over in one's mind the circumstances
									that led to the hurt, with the possibility that an old wound may be opened and that
									one could renew resentment against the "person" who is alleged to be present, and
									aware of one's thoughts. All thoughts of apology to be given or received can rapidly
									disappear. One might also be encouraged to consider the apologies that one would
									feel it necessary to make oneself. This is another ploy aimed at inducing a further
									mind trawl, calculated to reveal incidents or thoughts that are derogatory of others
									or oneself.

								<p>
									Intent upon self-purification and spiritual development, the hearer may find himself
									being drawn closer and closer into contact with, and reliance upon, the voices in
									his mind and the ambient presences that are subtly intruded. Apparently proceeding
									in a manner that gives satisfaction to his "mentors", he might find himself being
									rewarded with the presence around him of supposedly senior and powerful beings,
									and being told in his mind that he has been accepted, but at a junior level. Henceforth,
									he will be part of a "team", but as a receiver of instruction and a neophyte. Yet
									another step has been taken along a road that may deprive him of his own reasoning
									and decision making abilities, and lead him into a state of dependence from which
									he may never break free, unless he receives skilled and understanding assistance.</p>
								<p>
									He will become a "listener" - listening within to his "controls"; not focussing
									on the people and world around, but always within. You have perhaps been in a cocktail
									party or other gathering where there is fervent conversation going on in the groups
									all around, and you are trying to converse with someone who is directly in front
									of you, someone whose face is turned attentively towards you, but whose eyes are
									seemingly vacant, and certainly not focused on you. The conversation in the adjoining
									group, the little bit of gossip half heard, is so much more interesting, riveting,
									than your conversation. These are the same eyes and the demeanour of someone who
									is locked into the inner mind and communication; someone who is listening to current
									conversation within, or who is listening to the silence - waiting for the next contact,
									which has become more real than the people around. </p>
								<p>
									Still in this context, I am reminded of a woman who briefly passed through my group
									of friends, who, in a similar way, exemplifies what I am trying to convey. While,
									say, gardening and carrying on herself with what she was doing, she would say "Listen,
									Roy ..." while she thought of something to say and hold the centre of attention,
									and, until I learned to ignore the call, I would stand in suspense, waiting for
									the next remark.
								</p>
								<p>
									We still have within ourselves all of the instinctive, behavioural actions and reactions
									of our mammalian evolution. The automatic and autonomic functions are too frequently
									dismissed as "flight, fight, adrenalin". There are very many more reactions and
									interactions prompted by social and instinctive triggers. I have a book that provides
									instruction for budding cartoonists, and which shows a hundred stylised cartoon
									faces that are designed to illustrate an equal number of emotions and reactions.
									Each of the expressions, when on the actual face of a person, would be accompanied
									by a range of corresponding internal changes, involving sphincters, eye focus, blood
									distribution, muscle tensions and breathing, that are, mostly, too subtle to be
									observed or actually felt. </p>
								<p>
									A wild creature that hears a sound that might suggest a threat, adopts a "listening"
									state. In this state, and simplistically, ears are cocked, breathing is almost suspended
									to enable the hearing to become more acute, genitals are tensed and anal and bladder
									sphincters are tightened, while the creature adopts a "shoulder hunched" posture,
									possibly to create a low profile. In the animal, the changes last as long as the
									stimulus exists, and a quiescent state returns, or the creature reacts to the next
									and different set of stimuli.</p>
								<p>
									For the perpetually listening human, there is no release, as the internal reactions
									become the norm. To the blank, listening gaze of the listener will be added the
									hunched shoulders and shallow breathing. Invisible, and probably un-remarked, because
									it has become the norm, is the tight anal sphincter, which, in turn, is accompanied
									by a constriction at the base of the throat. The latter constriction is part of
									an internal mechanism that, in the threatened mammal, diverts blood supply from
									the digestive organs and brain into the muscles of response, preparing the latter
									for immediate action if the potential threat becomes real. In the human, the long-term
									diminution of blood supply to the brain must have many consequences that I am not
									competent to analyse.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, in the analysis of the brains of schizophrenics, note is often taken of
									local changes in brain structure, which are then considered to be among the <i>causes</i>
									of the schizophrenic state. To me, it is reasonable to question whether the changes
									within the brain are the <i>result</i> of a curtailment of the blood supply, and
									are themselves, in turn, a consequence of the perpetual listening.</p>
								<p>
									I am reminded of these phenomena as I sit at <i>my</i> computer in intense concentration
									and suddenly realise that my shoulders are hunched, <i>my</i> breathing is very
									shallow, while my thought processes are turning into treacle and a series of aches
									and tensions are created in various places. I am "listening" intently into my mind
									and memory as I try to convert my notes and experiences into a coherent narrative.
								</p>
								<p> Until I learned various methods of preventing the results of my absorption from
									having these effects, I used to be concerned at the persistent shallowness of my
									breathing. At that time, my efforts aimed at restoring regular, deep breathing,
									produced only limited results. In an effort to induce natural breathing at all times,
									I went to visit someone whom I know who is a properly trained hypnotherapist, having
									the idea that it should be possible, under hypnosis, for her to program me to
									breathe regularly and fully, even when in deep and persistent thought.
								</p>
								<p>
									Having heard me through, my friend said firmly that her training would not allow
									her to do what I asked: she would need, over a number of sessions, to find out why
									<i>my</i> breathing was shallow, and <i>then</i> try to change the pattern. Disappointed,
									as we live some distance apart, I nevertheless accepted her offer of simple hypnosis
									aimed at inducing deep relaxation. In all, I am acquainted with five qualified hypnotherapists,
									three of whom are also G.P.s, and had then already experienced hypnosis induced
									by two of them. Among other motives, I was interested in comparing my friend's technique
									with that of the other two.
								</p>
								<p>
									While I still remember that her approach was different from those that I had experienced
									previously, it is sufficiently long ago for me to have only a vague recollection
									of the actual details. What I do remember is going through a series of stages of
									"induction" and becoming mentally detached, and on the verge of losing awareness.
								</p>
								<p>
									At this point, and yet still capable of thought, I experienced a strong physical,
									spiritual intrusion into myself, while my rational mind helped me to hold onto consciousness.
									Within my state of residual awareness, I had been able to realise that <i>had</i>
									I allowed myself to continue into deep hypnosis, there was a strong possibility
									that I would have been taken over and spoken through, as is a trance medium. This
									is not only my assertion. I formerly had many discussions with one of my G.P. friends,
									who, with the patients' permission, used to let me observe his technique at work.
									On one occasion that I remember, my friend had recently returned from a conference
									of medical hypnotherapists, and related how one of the speakers had cautioned members
									about the very things of which I am writing.</p>
								<p>
									In increasing flow, Eastern religious, philosophical and esoteric practices have
									made their way westward - concepts of reincarnation, past lives, karma - almost,
									one might say, in a "pick and mix" combination with aspects of Buddhism, yoga, martial
									arts, Qi gong and many more. I am not drawn into this world of belief myself, although
									I have many friends who have a greater or lesser interest, and some who are ardent
									practitioners, and I read much of what is accessible to the non-participant. </p>
								<p>
									There is a common thread that seems to link many, and that is a belief in past lives,
									reincarnation and the possibility of regression into a past life while under hypnosis.
									I do not intend to get drawn into a discussion about other peoples' sincerely held
									beliefs and practices; however, my own experience while being hypnotised makes me
									question most strongly the merits and reality of alleged past life regression. I
									see it as being fraught with danger for the vulnerable - and even for the apparently
									stable.
								</p>
								<p>
									Several years ago, someone who stayed at my home for about two years, used to like
									to be taken to local group meetings of a national healing organisation. I did not
									stay for the actual proceedings, but returned for the social chat and refreshments
									with which the meetings ended. Almost the entire group of very delightful people
									believed that each had a persona derived from a past life. What struck me forcibly
									was that some appeared to be acting out a version of the personality that they believed
									that they once had. Of itself, this activity is for the individual and not me to
									choose. </p>
								<p>
									In the context in which I am writing I <i>am</i> concerned, for within this belief
									and practice there is the mechanism by means of which a person can be taken over
									and controlled. There is the distinct possibility that, under hypnosis, intrusion
									may have occurred, and that the perceived change in attitude and function may be
									interpreted as being a reflection of the character of the supposed previous incarnation.
									Often, the earlier status is presented as having been important or desirable for
									some reason, and the person is flattered and consciously or unconsciously adopts
									a new role and personality. In time, the "real" person, i.e. the one in <i>this</i>
									life, may become dominated completely by the inner, and unable to function normally.</p>
								<p>
									The ability to hypnotise is easily achieved, but is not necessarily accompanied
									by the responsibility or awareness that should pervade the practice. The Web lists
									numerous courses, many controlled by responsible bodies whose aim is to produce
									competent medical hypnotherapists. However, the Web also lists others of dubious
									probity and responsibility, offering "training and qualification" by distant learning,
									as indicated by the following extract from one advertisement:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p style="text-align: center;">
										"HYPNOTHERAPY IS THE CAREER OF THE FUTURE<br />

									Reading the complete advertisement reveals that there is no personal contact between
									school and client - all is "achieved" using books and tapes. And the "examination"
									is similarly conducted - a written test paper and a video or audio tape of a "session"
									being the only requirements necessary to gain the coveted certificate, and a series
									of convincing letters to place after the name! Such is the type of "training" of
									some who offer, among other benefits, "regression therapy" and N.L.P. (neuro-linguistic
									programming).
								</p>
								<p>
									The threat to the minds of vulnerable people is immense, and is added to in significant
									measure by the antics of the "stage hypnotist". A further advertisement on the Web
									offered "the fastest training for stage hypnotists". The public distortion of peoples'
									minds and behaviour for the sake of entertainment has, in my belief, the possibility
									of causing harm to the participants that may result in permanent damage to their
									personality.
								</p>
								<p>
									Just as sharks know where food is most likely to be found, and just as they have
									highly sensitive detection equipment to inform them when something suitable has
									arrived: just as prey animals know of the waterholes where victim species are likely
									to be present and off their guard: just as vultures have the keenness of perception
									to detect from afar the potential meal - in like manner are the spiritual intruders
									equipped. It is not my intention to catalogue all of the circumstances and venues
									that lend themselves to spiritual intrusion, only to use a small number as illustrations.
								</p>
								<p>
									One that readily comes to mind is the so-called "clubbing" culture in which many
									simply want to get "stoned" on drink, drugs, or both, and to end up with a quick
									"shag". No doubt there are many who remain in control, but there are undoubtedly
									many others who do not, and who risk damage to their lives and minds, and put themselves
									into situations in which intrusion is possible. The desire to use the latest "recreational"
									drug or combination of substances to achieve a much-vaunted experience may induce
									individuals to pursue practices that, if they were to be examined rationally, amount
									to little short of self-degradation.</p>
								<p>
									Many will have read the series of books by Carlos Castaneda, who sought "knowledge
									and enlightenment" via mescaline and the "spirit" of his own peyote plant, which
									"revealed" itself to him in the desert. I read the first book on the recommendation
									of friends who were raving about it. All that I saw was someone who was prepared
									to degrade himself in the pursuit of some supposed goal of inner enlightenment and
									power. To crawl around on all fours in the guise of a dog, and to vomit uncontrollably
									in the desert night, does not suggest itself as an ideal preliminary to spiritual
									development.
								</p>
								<p>
									While reading the book, I was reminded of the story of one young woman, a committed
									cocaine addict, who went into a public lavatory in order to give herself a much-needed
									"fix". Her trembling hands dropped the powder on the toilet floor, and she came
									to her senses to find herself on all fours about to lick it up, so desperate was
									she for the drug. The shock of seeing herself in such a state of degradation was
									sufficient to drive her away from drugs.</p>
								<p>
									Others are not so fortunate, and having, in their mentally weakened state, become
									the victim of an intrusion, have their desires and degradation turned on and off
									at the whim of the intruder. There are many other potential sources of personal
									degradation than drugs that I do not intend to catalogue, but, rather, will leave
									it to you to compile your own list.</p>
								<p>
									One unfortunate consequence of a degraded lifestyle is imprisonment. Once in prison
									and "banged up" for possibly twenty-three hours a day, the mind of the prisoner
									can become a happy hunting ground for intruding spirits. With endless time at their
									disposal, <i>they</i> gradually enter the thoughts of the incarcerated and can produce
									untold torment that may ultimately lead to self-harm, suicide or mind destruction.</p>
								<p>
									Many who have been convicted of the most degraded or despicable crimes are advised
									to accept solitary confinement to keep themselves away from other prisoners who
									might attack them. Within the solitude, the captive mind can be toyed with and "bounced"
									between a seemingly endless variety of voices, or "harried" by a duality of voices
									in the manner of greyhounds coursing a hare.
								</p>
								<p>
									A person can find himself or herself persuaded into wrong-doing by warm, "companionate"
									voices, that may have become part of their normal thoughts, and accepted almost
									as an "inner counsellor". This can become the lot of an intelligent, imaginative
									and, possibly, isolated person. Such a one can become used to the inner discourses
									that may be a part of the normal process of mentally teasing away at a problem or
									argument.
								</p>
								<p>
									A separate inner voice may be truly indistinguishable from ones own thoughts, and
									yet become a source of deliberately, yet subliminally, intruded thoughts. Such a
									voice can become companionable to the solitary person and apparently share memories
									and reminiscence. Such a voice can pour the balm of solicitude on the hurts and
									injustices of life; can become a permanent, trusted friend, and yet, withal, keep
									the resentments stoked, and suggest ways of getting one's own back.
								</p>
								<p>
									Such a voice can, almost as a joke or game, propose an action such as shoplifting.
									"The coast is clear, go on, I'll keep watch". With the first attempt a success,
									the joint venture is set to become a constant game and, between them, the person
									and the inner voice devise new and ingenious strategies, until, possibly at the
									urgent prompting of the voice, the person believes that he can accomplish something
									daredevil - and is exposed.</p>
								<p>
									I sometimes wonder whether this was the fate of a well-known person - a regular
									broadcaster, magistrate and author - who was detected shoplifting, sentenced, and,
									in her shame, committed suicide. It was revealed that she had devised an ingenious
									topcoat, with numerous inner pockets designed to receive the booty. Personally,
									having experienced the persuasive ways of the voices, although not in this particular
									context, I find it easy to believe that this person had been tricked as I suggest,
									and when exposed, had been hounded to suicide by her "friend and companion", the
									inner voice, which had now turned against her, and mocked her in her humiliation.</p>
								<p>
									Does this seem far-fetched? Does the concept of friendly encouragement, support,
									and reliable and close companionship that turns into, or exists as a cover for,
									deceit and malevolence, seem far-fetched? It can happen at the human level. Do the
									names Burgess, MacLean, Blunt and Philby resonate with you?
									<!-- Cambridge Five spy ring https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Five -->
									Perhaps you are too
									young to have known. Three were highly placed in British Intelligence, having access
									to much secret and extremely sensitive information, while the fourth was greatly
									regarded within the world of fine art, and occupied the position of surveyor of
									the Queen's pictures - he having also served in Intelligence during World War II.
									All lived lives that were apparently impeccable, and fully integrated into the society
									and government of their day - and all were traitors of the vilest kind, working
									in the closest possible way with the then Cold War enemy, the Soviet Union, and
									being, amongst other things, betrayers of many British agents, sending them to torture
									and death.
								</p>
								<p>
									Of many ploys adopted by the intelligent intruding spirits, one is to become the
									inner voice of someone who lives a life of utmost probity, who is highly regarded,
									and who develops a reputation as, for example, a "channeller", a giver of "readings",
									a "trance medium", a clairvoyant. Providing accurate, and perhaps comforting information,
									and, seemingly, giving excellent advice, the inner voice can, nevertheless, operate
									in one of the classical ways of espionage. This particular ploy succeeds when, within
									the confident and believable delivery, a "weasel" word or piece of advice is slipped
									into what may otherwise be genuine and sound. </p>
								<p>
									Can I recall to you the events that I related earlier, when, following the recommendation
									of a then associate, I went to see a woman who, it was said, was deeply spiritual
									and full of insight? I had no particular need of any sort of so-called "reading",
									but, as with many things that I do, I went mostly out of curiosity.</p>
								<p>
									As I have written previously, she was a most delightful person - open and welcoming.
									For almost two hours, with a break for lunch, I listened as I was fed words of presumed
									wisdom - words that I began to realise were of no significance, and meant nothing
									to me. However, within the inconsequential discourse, certain ideas were planted,
									which took me several years to discard. "I give you X and Y", said she, mentioning
									two names. "You will write a book in collaboration with someone who is already established
									in your field and, consequently, your writing will get a much needed boost". Whenever,
									subsequently, an X or a Y came into my orbit, in spite of myself, I wondered "Is
									this the X, or the Y whom she meant?" Likewise, when I became acquainted with someone
									new who appeared to have suitable writing talents, inevitably I would speculate
									about whether this was to be my collaborator.</p>
								<p>
									Rather more serious and insidious was the statement: "You will have teaching dreams".
									As well as intruding into the mind and body while a person is awake, it is evident
									that intrusions from spiritual sources occur during sleep. I do not intend to become
									involved in a study of the many instances when individuals through history have
									claimed to have been warned or given prescience during dreams. To do so would divert
									me from my main task. I do not doubt that it is possible for an individual to be
									influenced in this way. Had I, myself, been so gullible as to accept this proposition,
									and believed that I would be fed esoteric knowledge during my sleep, and then had
									been na&iuml;ve enough to incorporate the knowledge into my thinking and everyday
									practice - what then? </p>
								<p>
									With my experience of spiritual intrusion, I was able to see the ploy for what it
									was, and essentially, thereafter, have tried to apply all my growing alertness and
									discernment to an understanding of the sometimes weird world of my dreams. Someone
									<i>without</i> my experience might have been flattered to think that they were to
									have communication from - perhaps an "Ascended Master", to use the current glib
									jargon, or "The Source", to use another frequently used name - but who can say what
									the source might be, or how they have been influenced subsequently?

								<p>
									On a much bigger stage, a well-known American woman journalist developed a talent
									for automatic writing. She was fed such informed and corroborative detail relating
									to her personal life, that she doubted not that the sources of her writing were
									"all-seeing" and infinitely knowledgeable. The latter identified themselves with
									ideograms for "Donkey" and "Lily" - claiming that if they disclosed who they had
									<i>really</i> been when alive, the author herself would be overwhelmed at being
									chosen to channel from such eminent people.
								</p>
								<p>
									Over the course of her first book, <i>A Search for the Truth</i>, the author, Ruth
									Montgomery, passed on the "wisdom and insights" from - <i>whom</i>? How can anyone
									possibly know? She interlaced her chapters - first one from the "sources", then
									another, into which appeared apparently corroborative words from major American
									political or other well-known figures. Then back to the sources, and so on through
									the book - a book that, to some minds, gave the author credibility as a vehicle
									for "channelled" wisdom.
								</p>
								<p>
									A second book followed, inspired again by the "sources"; a book called <i>Strangers
										Among Us</i>. Without giving a lengthy description of the contents, I shall
									summarise two key ideas through which the book could be calculated to influence
									the vulnerable or gullible. The first is the concept of "walk-ins". This applied
									to individuals who may have become so desperate at the distressfulness of their
									earthly situation, that they would, by spiritual means, be offered the chance to
									exchange with "someone", now in spirit, who had so learned to match them that a
									"seamless" change could be made. The body would continue with its new "occupant",
									and the "dispirited" one would proceed, spiritually, to another plane of existence.
								</p>
								<p>
									The gullible, deceived by this seemingly desirable strategy, would, after a time,
									and still in the same body, believe that they actually were the "walk-in". So believing,
									an individual would thus continue in life, but in a state of being controlled totally
									by - <i>whom</i>? This ploy may seem even more far-fetched than some others that
									I am describing. Having, effectively, been "shadowed" spiritually, and, at one time,
									been aware of the presence of an invisible <i>doppelg&auml;nger</i> paralleling
									my being, I have no doubt about its reality and feasibility.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many people have scant scientific knowledge, and know very little about the planet
									upon which they dwell. This state of ignorance can easily be exploited, as exemplified
									in the second strategy that I have taken from the book. "There will be a nuclear
									holocaust within a specified number of years". "The earth will wobble on its axis,
									or even flip right over, causing huge sea waves which will swamp coastal areas,
									allowing only those inland and on high ground to survive". Such were some of the
									predictions of the "sources" - predictions that many would accept unquestioningly
									because of the apparent authority that the author had built up through the merits
									of her first book.
								</p>
								<p>
									Well, the specified number of years have long come and gone without, as far as I
									am aware, there having been a nuclear holocaust, and the earth has not wobbled nor
									flipped! (Although it <i>does</i> have precessing movements involving its orbit
									and axis, movements that are well know, but are capable of being mis-represented
									to influence the uninformed).
								</p>
								<p>
									Both of the quoted predictions were aimed at people who were gullible, and who,
									in their gullibility, were somehow made to feel that they could be among the survivors
									who would be required to repopulate and restore the earth. Strong in their beliefs,
									many formed small communities in isolated areas and learned basic survival crafts,
									ultimately losing touch with reality, and becoming disillusioned when the earth
									was not devastated and did not flip. This is a very limited summary, but one that,
									I hope, will serve to illustrate the ways in which an author, full of self belief,
									can be used unwittingly to influence and unsettle many individuals.
								</p>
								<p>
									Before leaving the topic, I must recall an earlier period in my story when I was
									myself living in a state of total conviction that the "Other" who were in my mind,
									and fully in my life, were real and had a <i>right</i> to question and pressurise.
									Looking back, I <i>know</i> that they were <i>real</i> and were neither hallucinations
									nor delusions, but <i>how</i> they came to have such authority and dominance, or
									how I <i>allowed</i> them to, I shall never be able to recall. All I know now is
									that they did, and that I allowed them. How else would I even <i>consider</i> the
									proposition that they made? This is what I wrote earlier:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"More and more the theme of the 'Second Coming' of Jesus was developed, and then,
										quite bluntly, it was put to me that He would return in a more mature person than
										was generally expected, and that I was a suitable candidate within whom He could
										manifest Himself. I cannot remember exactly how I declined such an offer that, it
										must be thought, no one could refuse. I do remember that I declared that I was too
										much of a coward to be able to accept such a high profile role."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									Someone well known in the world of football who, in accepting the proposition, achieved
									fame or notoriety depending on how one views the events, was David Icke. Convinced
									by a series of seemingly inexplicable coincidences, and accepting what he was told
									via the direct "channelling" of a well-known medium, David went public and proclaimed
									himself a "Son of God". He subsequently published books whose contents also arrived
									through "channels".</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"... I have communicated almost daily with Rakorski, the one known as Lord of all
										Civilization, who is directly responsible for the changes the earth will undergo
										... I was led to many psychics in Britain and other countries, and through them
										the Godhead and other beings of vast evolution have unveiled to me the mysteries
										of life. All have told of the same events to come in this decade, the great geological
										upheavals that will bring an end to the pain and suffering, anger and conflict that
										have taken this planet to the brink of non-existence ..."</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									As was the case with the prophecies given by Ruth Montgomery in her book, David
									Icke's decade also has passed and the geological upheavals that he foretold have
									not happened either. His books are read by some as if they contain genuine prophecy,
									by others as the outpouring of a mind whose balance is questioned. Innocuous as
									they may seem, to me they provide the openings through which the minds of susceptible
									individuals may be entered and eventually dominated:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"... I hope that by the time you have read this book you will appreciate that communication
										with such beings on other levels of Creation is the most natural thing in the world
										... Every time we think we create energy, a <i>thought-form</i> as it is called
										... A thought-form sent out by an Italian will be decoded by an Englishman into
										English, by a Frenchman into French. In this way thought-forms sent to us by the
										Spirit of the Earth or a being from another part of the universe can be decoded
										into spoken words by someone with psychic gifts which, indeed, all of us possess.
										This is called <i>channelling</i> ... This decoding can manifest in many ways, not
										only through the spoken word. The thought-forms can be turned into written words,
										and this is known as <i>automatic writing</i> ... It is also possible to hear the
										thought-forms as a soft gentle voice inside your head. I call this method 'getting
										it direct'. On a more limited level it is possible to communicate through <i>dowsing</i>."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									In my mind I yell with horror that such ideas are so gullibly spread to other potentially
									gullible people. The whole purpose of my writing is to <i>warn</i> the sensitive,
									the susceptible person of the dangers inherent in all these practices. If such people
									actually accept as genuine what they read, and if then they are persuaded by the
									books and their contents to try to communicate "... with the one we know as Jesus,
									the Spirit of the Earth, and many others ..." they are in great danger of having
									their minds entered and taken over as was mine before I realised what was happening.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have written before of the need for discernment by the readers of such books and
									proclamations. Many individuals are prevented from exercising any form of discernment
									by their very ignorance of anything remotely scientific, and by an amazing lack
									of curiosity about themselves, how they function, and about the planet upon which
									they live. Within this ignorance, many can be persuaded to believe the most outlandish
									propositions that are represented as coming from the "Ascended Masters" or similar.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"... the body has changed and adapted itself as it has risen up and fallen down
										the frequencies. Since Atlantis it has changed from taking in energy externally
										to digesting energy from food internally. The light levels have had to step in to
										help here and there, but ...".
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									There are many such allegedly channelled books and other literature in the catalogues,
									offering the "truths" from the "Ascended Masters", who channel under a variety of
									names ranging from Aldebran to Zed. Some are a collection, or collage, or heterogeneous
									mixture of existing philosophical or religious concepts. Others pretend a science
									such as the one from which I drew my illustrations. All hold the potential of influencing
									vulnerable minds.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some books have an inexpressible ambience that may be sensed even before they have
									been opened, almost as if they come with an attachment for good or evil. I have
									just talked on the phone to a friend who agrees entirely with what I am trying to
									convey. My friend has a daughter who trades in second-hand books, and many pass
									through the house, or come in from the library, for she is herself an avid reader.
									Only recently, my friend told me of two books that she had borrowed from our local
									library and which she could not wait to return. It was not that intrinsically the
									two purveyed evil; rather that, comprehensively, they seemed to embody it within
									their total and indefinable ambience. On the other hand, certain books on her shelf
									seemingly draw the eye, and in themselves are inspirational.

									Undoubtedly there are books that have been inspired from evil spiritual sources,
									although I cannot imagine that their authors would claim that this was the case.
									Evil itself works by being surreptitious and underhand - even by parading itself
									in the guise of good. On the other hand, there can not be many books more blatant
									than those of such authors as Aleister Crowley; books which, by their very challenge
									to orthodoxy, draw a readership - some sceptical and intent on debunking, others
									perhaps curious but open to the evil associations of the books and authors. And
									so, possibly touching just a few who are most vulnerable and clouding their minds
									to reality, the books and the original sources achieve their aim.
								</p>
								<p>
									Certain books about vampires and the cult that they inspire had a most profound
									effect upon a young man who this week has begun a life in prison. Influenced to
									the level of derangement, he murdered an elderly widow, cut out her heart, and drank
									her blood. I find it hard to believe that there are those who will not accept that
									the youth was evil and had been inspired by evil. But evil succeeds by pretending
									that it does not exist, and by persuading the "sophisticated" that such concepts
									are mediaeval and not "politically correct".
								</p>
								<p>
									Those who should speak out are often silent because, perhaps, they fear derision.
									It is possible that they also - they who, by virtue of their position within their
									culture or faith, should warn of what has been proclaimed in every region and at
									every time since the earliest - that they have been persuaded that "evil" is something
									arcane and pass&eacute;. Someone of eminence within the Catholic Church, who had,
									by omission, adopted such a position, was Cardinal Suenens. He admits such when
									he writes ...
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"I confess that ... I have not sufficiently stressed the reality of the Powers of
										Evil at work in our contemporary world, and the necessity of the spiritual combat
										we must wage. It is difficult to row against the tide and not succumb to the spirit
										of the times ... This, too, must be said, even at the risk of offending those who
										obstinately place their trust in the natural goodness of man and the myth of 'Progress'."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									I am currently reading a book that was published very recently, and which takes
									the reader as far back in the history of religion as it is possible to go, there
									to find the first recorded statement of the belief in the existence of the conflicting
									spiritual powers of "good" and "evil". The book, <i>A Search for Zarathustra</i>
									by Paul Kriwaczek, traces the author's quest to find the continuing influence on
									all subsequent religions, of the faith proclaimed by the prophet Zoroaster-Zarathustra.
								</p>
								<p>
									The point I am making now, have made before, and will continue to make is this:
									whether one believes in one religion; whether one acknowledges the validity of a
									number of them; whether one rejects totally <i>all</i> religions and religious thought
									- how can anyone completely reject and ignore the one theme that runs through every
									faith - namely the existence of spiritual good and evil and their influence upon
									individual people?
								</p>
								<p>
									In my efforts to bring the argument in to the present time, I have quoted the late
									surgeon and Psychiatrist, Dr. Kenneth McAll, and from his book, <i>Healing the Family
										Tree</i>; I have drawn from Clinical Psychologist, Wilson Van Dusen, and from
									his widely quoted chapter "<i>The Presence of Spirits in Madness</i>". Thus, from
									the earliest times to the present, there has run a consistent thread that just cannot
									be ignored. If you deny its existence and refuse even to think about the implications,
									just ask yourself whether you are one of those who are completely out of step, and
									whether you are denying those in your care the potential root of understanding and
									the relief of their suffering.</p>
								<p>
									In writing from so strong a personal conviction, I must ensure that I do not fall
									into the trap that Cardinal Suenens so ably revealed in his book of the nineteen-eighties,
									<i>Renewal and the Powers of Darkness</i>. Written at the peak of the then highly
									popular and influential "Charismatic Movement", in which individual Christians felt
									the upsurge of a revitalized recognition of the "charisms" or gifts of the Holy
									Spirit at Pentecost, the author cautioned against some of the excesses that were
									becoming manifest. One of these was a growing belief the <i>all</i> mental illness
									was the result of malevolent spiritual influence, a belief that created a consequent
									growth in individual attempts at exorcism - sometimes bringing harm to the participants
									- something that should be borne in mind by those who are engaging in the increasing
									practice of so-called "Spirit Release".
								</p>
								<p>
									The fact that this path is difficult to find and to follow should not, nevertheless,
									deter anyone from attempting to follow it, bearing in mind that it is not a path
									that one should wander down alone, nor without thought and preparation. Before I
									move on myself, I shall describe the real experiences of someone whom I know, which
									might add further illumination:</p>
								<p>
									"Ruth" used to work in a music shop that I visit from time to time. As I became
									better acquainted with her, I learned that she is epileptic - a condition that is
									obviously well controlled by drugs and an appropriate lifestyle. In time, Ruth told
									me that earlier she had had two types of fit. The first type is the one that she
									has had since her teens, and is controlled by the drugs. In the second, she experienced
									great distress as she was assailed by a "vile hag", who would try to drag her away
									or snatch the child from her womb. A reading in Church one day reminded Ruth of
									the account of Jesus curing an epileptic by driving out an "evil spirit". Prompted
									by this reminder, Ruth was prayed for within her Church community, and, during the
									same day, she experienced an immense relief within herself, and has since had complete
									freedom from the hag.</p>
								<p>
									Sometime afterwards, someone in the Church decided that there must be many who have
									experienced what might be called "mini-miracles", and invited such people to contribute
									to an intended publication. Ruth wrote her story, but, even before the accounts
									were published, her family home was invaded by a poltergeist. Among its varied activities,
									the latter would stamp around in first-floor rooms with such vigour that the light
									fittings in the ceilings below would shake. The noise of the stamping could be heard
									by neighbours at times when the family were not at home. It also startled one of
									Ruth's students when the latter was in a ground floor room during a piano lesson.
									Once, when the family had been on holiday, they found on their return that a collection
									of ornamental bottles, normally kept in the bathroom, had been thrown and smashed
									into the bath. The torment finally ended when a service of exorcism was held in
									the house, and, speaking on the phone to Ruth a moment ago, she assured me that,
									one year on, the creature has not returned.
