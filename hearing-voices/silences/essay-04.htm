									Hands up anyone who can remember the Mars Climate Orbiter of 1998. No one, I suspect.
									Not surprising when one reflects that space exploration is so far outside the everyday
									world of most people, that without special interest the various missions come and
									go with a bit of a flurry, and are soon forgotten. So why this one? It was notable
									because of its failure, and it failed because one group had worked in metric measurements,
									and another in Imperial. Thus whereas the orbiter should have been at 57 miles above
									the planet surface, it was actually at 57 kilometres. Far too close for comfort,
									and seemingly it crashed.</p>
								<p>
									I don't suppose many will recall one of the first friendly fire incidents of the
									recent Iraq conflict. A British plane returning to its carrier was shot down by
									a US missile - because the two groups hadn't synchronised their friend/foe identification.</p>
								<p>
									And I am certain that no one will have listened to the tape that I have here. It
									is of a radio broadcast of several years ago, which was devoted entirely to "schizophrenia".
									There were several speakers, eminent in their particular fields, who discussed and
									debated the wide-ranging topic that schizophrenia has become. Sounding very much
									like a group of religious luminaries, each of whom is defining "God" according to
									his or her own life experiences, so each likewise defined schizophrenia. Although
									they differed markedly in many respects, there was almost total agreement that the
									definition varied according from which side of the Atlantic it came.</p>
								<p>
									I am an engineer. My engineering career began in the Royal Navy in World War ll,
									when I was trained to service radar equipment. It was then that I learned the absolute
									need for accuracy - of definition and of purpose. Whether allied to gunnery or navigation
									every piece of information derived and supplied had to be accurate and lucidly stated.
									The safety of the ship and many lives might depend upon it.</p>
								<p>
									Demobbed, and equipped with an engineering degree, I arrived at Sellafield, where
									I spent all of my working life. The need for accuracy and lucidity became even more
									paramount, as one realised that the safety of a whole district might be put in jeopardy.
									My own field of measurement and control put me at the heart of the technology, with
									ultimate responsibility for the measuring and safety equipment of the four Calder
									Hall power reactors. In spite of much mis-information to the contrary, the power
									station delivered electricity safely for almost fifty years. The success of this
									and similar engineering projects depends so much on the constancy and universal
									agreement of all definitions and standards of measurement.</p>
								<p>
									The same standards, definitions and terminology obtained wherever in the world they
									were applied. Thus, in this novel power station, we had on attachment engineers
									from such diverse regions as Argentina, Australia and Japan, all speaking the same
									engineering language. In time, I went as a consultant to a similar French project
									- where again we understood each other in engineering terms, though sometimes with
									difficulty in actual language. Likewise, when in Stockholm I read a paper to an
									International Conference on measurement and control, my engineering assessments
									had the same impact on my audience from an equally wide range of nations.</p>
								<p>
									I have long retired, and although my engineering career is at an end, I still have
									the same mind set that colours my thinking and approach to new topics and activities.
									Thus, when I wanted to try to understand the concept of "paranoia", my first imperative
									was to find a definition. "I have been here before" I cried as I found myself back
									in the world of my "schizophrenia" tape recording. There are definitions aplenty,
									ranging from what appears to have been the original - namely "delusions of grandeur"
									- to the frequent and current interpretation of "looking over one's shoulder" in
									fear of being dominated psychologically.</p>
								<p>
									Within the range came a contribution from Sigmund Freud, which implied unconscious
									homosexual longings for one's father, and others that drew parallels with schizophrenia.
									Throughout there were many allusions to "delusions and hallucinations" leading to
									the direct association with schizophrenia, and it is from a personal analysis of
									these that I want to proceed.</p>
								<p>
									Since 1979, continuously and continuing, I have experienced all of what are called
									the "First Rank" symptoms of schizophrenia. I know the exact moment in which they
									began, and I know exactly what had led up to that moment. Yet in all of the 25+
									years that have elapsed, I have never been ill from this cause. Neither have I sought
									help, for I have not needed help, and I have not needed it because I knew from the
									outset exactly what was the cause.</p>
								<p>
									Because of what I was doing at the time, and because of what happened at the very
									moment, I have no doubt, not the minutest scintilla of doubt, that my experiences
									then and since are of spiritual origin. I kept copious notes, and have written extensively
									since, and I record that moment thus:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"A 'presence' that I could not see, moved from the space in front of me, into me,
										and immediately my mind was charged with another 'voice' or provoker of thoughts,
										thoughts over which, then, I had no control, and which were not initiated by me.
										In my head began conversation as between two separate people, one of whom was me.
										I began to 'hear voices'."</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									As well as the onset of "voices", what I want to emphasise is the awareness of physical
									presence within me, for this is what I sensed before the whole process of intrusion
									was completed. None of this was or is "delusion", nor yet "hallucination". I was
									completely conscious and aware of everything, and no definition of those two words
									will explain away the events or the accompanying sensations. </p>
								<p>
									I have written a full account of the events and all that has followed in a book
									that is published on the Internet as a free download,
									<span class="footnote"><a href="download.htm">[download.htm]</a></span>
									and cannot restate them here. What I intend is to use the knowledge that I have
									gained and apply it to offer an understanding of aspects of paranoia. I refer to
									spiritual intrusions, and include those of both benevolent and malevolent origin.
									Both are intelligent and are able freely to move into a person's body and mind.
									In this essay, I am considering only the malevolent, and refer to them as "they".
								</p>
								<p>
									The "voices" need not be blatant - threatening and dominating the individual mind
									in the classical manner experienced by the "schizophrenic". Subtly, almost subliminally,
									a word, phrase or idea can be suffused into the mind, appearing as if it is a person's
									own thought. Suppose, for example, someone is dominated at home or at work, or maybe
									a child at school. The "presence" of the tormentor can be created by the frequent
									repetition of a name, key word, or a general "ambience" that is hard to define.
									In the world of bird watching, reference is made to the "jizz" of a bird - the key
									characteristics that the experienced "twitcher" holds as mental reference and that
									enable the bird to be identified even though seen only momentarily. Individual people
									have "jizzes", and some or all of this ambience may be created in and around the
									sufferer.</p>
								<p>
									In the 1970s, I entered a short-lived second marriage to a widow who had two teenage
									children. Without going into unnecessary detail, I found myself in a domestic situation
									such as I had never encountered before. The trio had their own well established
									inter-relationship and communications, and soon I found that anything that I did
									or said was scrutinised and subject to comment and reported one to another. In time,
									I found myself feeling what I then would have called "paranoid" - using the popular
									definition of the word. Even though my then wife might not actually be present,
									her "presence" filled my every activity, and her inevitable return produced a feeling
									akin to foreboding. That was over thirty years ago, yet the identical feelings can
									be recreated through the simple injection of a key word, or by the generation of
									her "jizz" into my senses.
								</p>
								<p>
									In all, and over time, I identified more than thirty different "ploys" that I found
									were being used to try to subvert my mind, and exert control over it and me. Some
									have sub-plots, and not all are relevant in the context of paranoia. Others, however,
									are distinctly aimed at the creation of a "hang dog", persecuted inner feeling.</p>
								<ol class="generic">
									<li>

										Some mental "exchanges" seem to be promoted with the sole intent of arousing a confrontational
										response in me, just to keep me going for no great purpose other than to inhibit
										breathing; or they will maintain an endless, pointless prattle with the object solely
										of keeping me in a "listening" state. This state causes one to adopt a slightly
										hunched, "cringe" posture which can make one feel underdog and not in charge of
										what one is trying to do by undermining one's confidence. It is also designed to
										take one's mind off the immediate task with the almost inevitable mistake.

									</li>
									<li>

										Following an incident which could have been, or actually was, aggravating, or any
										situation which genuinely could have provoked anxiety, they will maintain an ambience
										of anxiety or apprehension, provoking the "low profile" syndrome. This could happen
										following a near miss when driving, particularly if one had been at fault, and has
										the same effect as if there was a nagging back-seat driver.
										<br /><br />
										If there are any areas of uncertainty in one's future, or possible sources of dispute,
										no matter how real, remote, or easy of solution, they will return to them again
										and again and again, stirring thought, introspection, resentment and anxiety.

									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They can intrude physically and mentally into one's every moment, delighting in
											creating emotions or exploiting potentially emotional situations, until one realises
											that attempts are made to create laughter or tears where one is not in the least
											stirred up in either direction sufficiently to laugh or cry. Similarly, if the situation
											arose, they could create anger and supply the words to go with it in a ready flow.
											They intrude into one's every thought and action, including the most intimate.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They induce a feeling akin to foreboding (not about anything specific) so that whatever
											one tackles there can be created an impression that there is something more important
											which one should be doing. Having, nevertheless, continued with the activity of
											one's first choice, they induce a feeling that one is doing it the wrong way&#8230;
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											It is all too easy to dwell upon the presence of the voice intrusions. Far more
											insidious, and possibly ever present, is the mute physical "overlap". Try to imagine
											a not quite exact "fit", so that in every movement or reaction there is just the
											little bit of anticipation or lag; of speeding up when it is inappropriate; of not
											being quite in phase on a turn; of causing forward movement when there are obstacles
											to be negotiated - whether by deliberate intent or lack of "skill" it is impossible
											to say.
										</p>
										<p>
											When the presence is continuous or frequently in and out it can become positively
											loathsome and one longs to be rid of it. If you have a copy, read in the <i>Thousand
												and One Nights</i> the story of the "Old Man of the Sea". Sinbad, shipwrecked
											and alone as usual, stumbles across an old man who asks for help to cross a stream.
											Sinbad, in his kindness, takes the old man on his back, and then when the stream
											is crossed finds himself in a stranglehold, beaten about the head, made to go this
											way and that, by day and night, at the old man's whim; be-skittered and be-pissed
											all down his back and generally befouled.
										</p>
										<p>
											It is only ultimately by making some wine from wild grapes and getting the man drunk
											that Sinbad is finally freed, and one can sense the ultimate release as he crushes
											the man's skull with a boulder. Many times have I wished for that boulder! It is
											possible from one's own reactions to these presences to understand how it is that
											individuals will harm themselves in an effort to get at or get rid of this gross
											intrusion that is only reachable within their own body.
										<p>
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									I have never experienced "delusions of grandeur", but, before I recognised the ploys
									for what they were, there were times when I believed that I was being fed words
									of inspiration, and I used them without exercising any discernment. The possibility
									exists of being made to feel that one is inspired, invincible - with the likelihood
									of disastrous consequences. </p>
								<p>
									It may be that I am imagining the sequence of events that occurred during a session
									of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" One contestant worked through the succession
									of the questions with some of the answers arriving seemingly by means of a form
									of inspiration. His growing confidence and sense of invincibility showed in his
									demeanour. With no lifelines left, and with &pound;250,000 to his credit, he was
									faced with a question about the height of the Oscar statuette. He said that when
									"11 inches" came up among the possible answers on the screen, he felt a "frisson"
									through his body - not questioning how it had been created. Obviously believing
									himself to be "inspired", he chose that answer, and lost &pound;218,000.
								</p>
								<p>
									The build up of a feeling of invincibility in a person is one of the other ploys
									of which I write in my book - and also the inner persecution that can be engendered
									following downfall or exposure.</p>
								<p>
									There is a great danger that it could be suggested that all mental health problems
									are caused by adverse spiritual intrusion. This is patently not so, but the possibilities
									that I have outlined should be considered.
								</p>
								<p>
									Additionally, it is so very important not to lose sight of the universal existence
									of the sources of benevolent spiritual inspiration and support. The fact that most
									individuals perceive such insights to be locked in "religion" can be a deterrent
									to many, and they are not sought.
								</p>
								<p>
									In all that I have written in my book and elsewhere, I try to avoid the direct link
									with religion, and write always of "spiritual intervention" completely outside the
									domain of any religious faith. That such sources exist however, and that they have
									had a profound influence upon me during the 25 years about which I have been writing,
									is something that I will never cease to acknowledge.</p>
