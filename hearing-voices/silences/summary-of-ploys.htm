									In the text, "they" refers to the intrusive spiritual entities.

								<ol class="generic">
									<li>
										<p>
											They maintain a constant delivery of good, impeccable advice and an ambience
											of support that, at first, is comforting. However, it persists into every act, or
											thought of an act or plan, to a degree that it becomes obsessive, by which time
											one can have reached a state of dependence and find difficulty in detaching oneself.
											But more than that, this can constitute a form of "jamming" which can cause one
											to reject the desirable counsel that may come from a good source.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They create or latch onto a feeling of buoyancy - "let's go"; "get the skates
											on"; "have you thought of this or that?"; "surely that's more important"; - just
											an edge of urgency where none exists.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											When at the start of a day, particularly a promising one, one has a plan of action
											worked out, they will put forward a pressing alternative; then if that is rejected,
											another, and so on, inducing a feeling of panic and the feeling that the whole lot
											will be aborted and nothing done.</p>
										<p>
											This ploy is often used when the "meteorology" is such that a woolly, inert mind
											is being induced naturally, anyway. In these circumstances the whole day can be
											spent in a series of feeble attempts at - nothing.</p>
										<p>
											Not a lot is required to break this stagnation; e.g. company and stimulus from a
											trusted friend, or "boot-straps" i.e. just beginning on something simple such as
											digging or other "mindless" activity which does not require precise measurement
											or decision making.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They will instigate or intrude a salacious thought - either general or about
											a particular person. If it is taken up and dwelt on they will switch roles and introduce
											the supposed "exalted one", whose presence may also be simulated physically, creating
											the ambience that one has slipped on one's path to inner purity of thought etc.
											and that one is not being a fit place of residence for pure spirits.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They create an ambience which suggests that the "top spiritual team" has now
											arrived, that one is privileged to be part of it, but at a junior level; that in
											future one will be more a receiver of instructions rather than an initiator of activity
											and thought as an individual - a ploy which will gradually erode one's own decision
											making ability, with a resulting state of dependence.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											"Characters" in this "role play" can be switched until one is uncertain whether
											it is the "good" or "bad" guy who is proposing something. (This is annoyingly difficult
											to describe - one is aware of the situation as it is happening but such a convoluted
											web has been woven that the strands cannot be separated.)
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											A "character" can appear as at one's elbow - the cynical, knowledgeable bystander
											who has seen it all before - nudges one into recognition of the ploy - poses as
											a friend, man of the world...</p>
										<p>
											It would be so easy to have confidence in him, accept comments, advice, and yet
											again lose one's own capability of analysis and decision-making.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Some "exchanges" seem to be promoted with the sole intent of arousing a confrontational
											response in me, just to keep me going for no great purpose other than to inhibit
											breathing, or they will maintain an endless, pointless prattle with the object solely
											of keeping me in a "listening" state. This state causes one to adopt a slightly
											hunched, "cringe" posture which can make one feel underdog and not in charge of
											what one is trying to do by undermining one's confidence. It is also designed to
											take one's mind off the immediate task with the almost inevitable mistake.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They will pretend to be "good guys" being impatient with progress on a major
											plan or scheme, which, if persisted with, causes me to react rudely, which, in turn,
											can create a feeling of alienation with a resultant difficulty in re-establishing
											prayerful intercourse with the "genuine" ones.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Pretending to be good spirits they encourage one to dredge one's mind for any
											- usually long past - incidents or thoughts of an embarrassing, shameful or similar
											nature, especially if others are involved; or will encourage reminiscence about
											incidents in which others - family, friends - showed up badly, especially known
											or imagined (usually sexual) peccadilloes etc.</p>
										<p>
											They will pretend that the persons themselves are present in spirit, and aware of
											the thoughts, and will then give the impression that one will be confronted on death;
											that everyone in "heaven" will be aware of and condemnatory of all this. In this
											general context they will insinuate into one's mind a name which is calculated to
											produce speculation or reminiscence from the past - often someone with whom one
											has been close or intimate - always trawling the mind, encouraging recollections,
											particularly of a sexual nature.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They can intrude physically and mentally into one's every moment, delighting
											in creating emotions or exploiting potentially emotional situations, until one realises
											that attempts are made to create laughter or tears where one is not in the least
											stirred up in either direction sufficiently to laugh or cry. Similarly, if the situation
											arose, they could create anger and supply the words to go with it in a ready flow.
											They intrude into one's every thought and action, including the most intimate.</p>
										<p>
											One just longs for an empty space in one's mind where one can think one's own thoughts,
											enjoy one's own emotions and reminiscences without these intrusions. One develops
											the most intense hatred of them. One result of this barrage is that one resents
											any intrusion or contact, thus rendering suspect those which might originate from
											a desirable spiritual source - they simulate these as well, so as to create animosity
											in one's mind to potential or existing spiritual helpers.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They will seize upon and try to exploit even the most minor peccadillo, or even
											supposed ones, in the context of one's religion and spiritual growth, and make it
											become an obsession beyond all reason, while at the same time creating a physical
											ambience of censoriousness. This can overshadow the brightest company or activity,
											almost as if there is a sentence hanging over one - reminiscent of when, in serious
											past depression, there existed a feeling of "gut hollowness" which totally prevented
											one's enjoyment and development, much as I imagine the existence of a cancer in
											one's body might.</p>
										<p>
											They will create around one a feeling of "unworthiness", particularly if the main
											thrust of one's life is towards good. They create the impression that the "lovely
											people" i.e. benevolent spirits who normally dwell around one's home, or who, they
											imply, would otherwise dwell there, are censorious, disapproving, on the point of
											departing, or indeed have departed; they do their utmost to create in one's mind
											an antagonism to such souls. One can imagine the inner state of someone such as
											a clergyman with homosexual or similar bent whose life is otherwise impeccable,
											being mentally and spiritually hounded and made to feel that everything that he
											does is sullied - this particularly so at, say, a Eucharist.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Before one has had time or opportunity to make up one's mind about a possibly
											contentious issue they will interject a thought so instantly that it could be one's
											own thought. This will be immediately responded to by an adversary, resulting in
											the apparently "good" and "bad" guys having a dispute, into which one is drawn without
											any forethought, totally and inadvertently, and in a whole ambience of dissent being
											created.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											When composing in my mind what I intend to say to someone, they will "offer"
											a suitable word where an alternative exists; this is often the most obvious or best
											choice, but they will try to create the impression that it is their choice. This
											can lead to a situation or continuing state in which one becomes reliant on being
											fed the appropriate word or sequence. If one has not had cause to question the source
											but indeed believes it to be "genuine" and benevolent, one can end up waiting to
											be "inspired" and believing that one is a "chosen channel".</p>
										<p>
											Indeed, when one is writing or speaking, possibly promoting an idea or cause, they
											will invade the mind and/or body, creating an impression of excitement and implying
											that one has been "chosen" to channel words from an "exalted" source. In the euphoria
											of believing oneself to be so chosen it is possible to lose any critical or common
											sense analysis which one would normally apply and to let oneself be used solely
											as a mouthpiece, often destroying one's credibility in the eyes of those whom one
											is trying to convince.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											When one is driving they get a mental conversation going, often of a contentious
											nature, or maybe stoke a current resentment, doing this just prior to the approach
											of difficult bit of road at which they know that one will meet another, perhaps
											ill-driven, vehicle. In doing so they can distract one completely from one's normal
											safe driving with possible disastrous results.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They will attempt to build a camaraderie in the car, pretending to be, say,
											my father, sharing feelings about other road users' style of driving etc., constantly
											working to build up a feeling of reliance on their opinion, or seeking to impress.
											They will then attempt to indicate that it is OK to overtake, for example, - it
											often is. They are constantly trying to build an aura of "rely on me". If one did,
											inevitably the crunch would come.</p>
										<p>
											This ploy has many variants in other situations - a simple example could be that
											of the compulsive gambler who is led on with successful tips for winners - until
											the time when he has "staked all" and then the rug is pulled from under him.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Following an incident which could have been, or actually was, aggravating, or
											any situation which genuinely could have provoked anxiety, they will maintain an
											ambience of anxiety or apprehension, provoking the "low profile" syndrome. This
											could happen following a near miss when driving, particularly if one had been at
											fault, and has the same effect as if there was a nagging back-seat driver.
										</p>
										<p>
											If there are any areas of uncertainty in one's future, or possible sources of dispute,
											no matter how real or remote or easy of solution, they will return to them again
											and again and again, stirring thought, introspection, resentment and anxiety.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											When one is examining an original thought, they attempt to muscle in, giving
											the impression that they are party to it and its subsequent exploration and indeed
											will attempt to "own" the new idea. Further, when one is engaged in deep thought,
											they will interject a person's name or an interesting word that will give rise to
											speculation and, unless corrected, can lock the mind in a channel of irrelevant
											thought.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Sometimes very vivid dreams are followed on waking by a deliberately fragmented
											conversation, often with the suggestion that one's mind is being taken over at a
											deeper level - if one is gullible one can be convinced that one is losing one's
											mind, or that it is part of a process by which one will become integrated into the
											"spirit mind".
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											The moment of waking, or the time of gradually emerging awareness after sleep
											is most crucial, for one is then at one's most vulnerable. One's first thoughts
											at these times are "answered"; indeed it might seem that one is already in a conversation.
											It is exceedingly difficult to avoid responding, and a dialogue can ensue from which
											it is hard to break free. There can be a feeling created on waking, a sense of being
											with very gentle spiritual people, warm, welcoming and caring. It is so easy to
											slip into this ambience, particularly if the rest of one's life is bleak or fraught.</p>
										<p>
											But, as one is starting to feel "cosy" and cared for, they start to imply that there
											are one or two, oh-so-teeny, defects that need correcting before one can be truly
											accepted and enjoy this ambience and ultimately be accepted into it after death.
											Gradually the emphasis shifts becoming more needling and ultimately threatening.
											One's defects become grossly magnified, one's sense of unworthiness exaggerated,
											and all the earlier warmth totally disappears.
										</p>
										<p>
											Sometimes an intrusion can be of such a cold, inhuman presence that one can feel
											oneself to be totally devoid of humanity, of love, of caring. One could become either
											very ill or very evil.</p>
										<p>
											It is virtually impossible for anyone in this state to convey to another the sense
											of threat or terror that can be experienced at these times. This inability to communicate
											can so increase a person's sense of loneliness, of total isolation that they can
											easily try to seek oblivion in drink or drugs or suicide - indeed, it is quite possible
											that in their mind they will be actively encouraged down some desperate or diabolical
											route.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Physical intrusions can and do occur at any time; the differing intensities
											and variety are so great that is difficult to be specific. One example can occur
											when I am woodcarving. At these times there can appear a "heavy" intruding presence
											with a "working" mouth of concentration and with laboured breathing - the conclusion
											being that someone `in spirit` is trying to experience what they did not achieve
											in life. There is also the implication at other times that someone formerly skilled
											in life is wanting to impart that skill. This can present one with a difficult choice.
											There are or have been many musicians, composers, artists, writers and others who
											have freely acknowledged that they cannot produce their finest work unless their
											"Muse" is present within them, and many and great are the works which have been
											produced. (See The Unknown Guest by Brian Inglis). By contrast, I do not want to
											be "taken over" - I want to work out my own problems; I want the sheer pleasure
											of first of all visualising, and then creating, my own art or craft; I do not want
											to be the vehicle for "someone" to operate vicariously and to remove the pleasure
											of my own originality.</p>
										<p>
											I once had a very good sculpture/<wbr />carving teacher; he gave advice on concepts and
											techniques, but did not attempt to influence one's individual expression, nor did
											he touch the work unless asked to demonstrate, but was always there with advice
											if asked. Above all, he inspired immense confidence, and could rescue one from the
											most depressing "artistic disasters".</p>
										<p>
											This, by extension, is what one would hope for from desirable spiritual helpers.
											Having done much to my house by way of development, and not having had craft training
											or much DIY experience, I have, nevertheless been given, by "inspiration", much
											help - too great to detail. It however helps me to make the point that there is
											much support and knowledge available, but it is received at a much, much deeper
											level than the other phenomena about which I have written - virtually subliminally.</p>
										<p>
											There can be a very great danger in accepting a "Muse" into one's person. It can
											often be represented or inferred that this is the spirit of someone who formerly
											was a well-known artist, musician etc. The belief that one has been chosen by this
											famous person can be very flattering, but if continued, gradually one could lose
											one's own identity and capacity for originality.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They induce a feeling akin to foreboding (not about anything specific) so that
											whatever one tackles there can be created an impression that there is something
											more important which one should be doing. Having, nevertheless, continued with the
											activity of one's first choice, they induce a feeling that one is doing it the wrong
											way.</p>
										<p>
											In the same general context, and as an example, suppose that one had chosen to garden,
											there could "appear" the "good gardener" ally who makes approving noises - or alternatively
											withholds approval - so that one loses the sense of one's own judgment, particularly
											as in most cases the task is one which does not require advice or comment.</p>
										<p>
											Again, they offer constant advice on ways of doing a job - always sound- until one
											finds oneself waiting for it before making a move, thereby having one's capacity
											for original thought, or consideration of method, undermined; this happens particularly
											when one hasn't previously worked out one's plan or technique.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Many times good advice is given or factual statements made; for example, once
											when thinking of the herb "horsetail", the specific name Equisetum was fed into
											my mind - a fact which I already knew. In such circumstances I then have the dilemma
											- is this "know all" approach designed to be helpful or annoying? Is it meant to
											be positive and helpful and contribute to my work, or is it intended to create in
											me an aggravation at all intrusions, so that even if there were to be established
											a desirable, direct and open collaboration, I would resent it? I don't know. Perhaps
											it is again part of a ploy to make me abandon or lose the faculty for original thought.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											A "heavy" presence, purporting to be a "senior" heavenly figure, introduces
											the concept that someone, deceased, does or will wish to apologise for lifetime's
											hurts. This prompts one to go over in one's mind the circumstances which at the
											time caused the hurt, with possible renewed resentment against the "person" who
											is alleged to be present or near at hand and aware of one's thoughts, with all thought
											of apology given or received rapidly disappearing. One could also be led to consider
											the apologies that one might feel constrained to want to make oneself, with a consequent
											mental rehashing of past traumas. This, it would seem, is yet another ploy to get
											a mind trawl going aimed at bringing to the surface incidents or thoughts derogatory
											to others or oneself.</p>
										<p>
											They will insinuate a word, phrase, name, thought or picture into one's mind which
											will start a train of reminiscence and which is calculated to lead to yet more revelations
											about oneself or other people. The most remote detail of one's past is known or
											has been extracted.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											On one occasion whilst working on my private water supply, which is isolated
											and out of view, I was caused to fall by a "wrestle". This demonstrated, and was
											confirmed by implication, that I could be caused to fall and be injured somewhere
											with no chance of summoning help (or fall in a dangerous location e.g. train or
											vehicle). It was impressed upon me that I should always plan where I was going and
											what I was going to do, and that if I was going to be alone in an isolated location,
											I should ensure that someone was aware of where I could be found. It was further
											impressed on me that I would get immense help and protection if there was forethought
											in all my actions - that if I wanted to draw from the help which is always available,
											I should prepare beforehand for such activities as study or giving healing.</p>
										<p>
											On another occasion when I was walking between my house and workshop I was physically
											"gutted", for want of a better word. This was completely spontaneous and without
											explanation - none was needed, for the meaning was obvious. It was as if a hand
											had reached in and torn out my solar plexus. Physical recovery was fairly quick,
											but the mental shock and implication stayed much longer.</p>
										<p>
											On yet another occasion, when playing rounders or cricket in my field with some
											nephews and nieces, I was running vigorously when my legs were "kicked" from under
											me and I fell heavily. It was equivalent to the most blatant foul I had ever experienced
											when playing rugby at school or in the Navy.</p>
										<p>
											It is virtually impossible to convey to someone who has not experienced it, the
											actuality of physical spiritual intrusion. Until the reality of both thought intrusion
											and physical presence is accepted by those whose role it is to care for the people
											who find it difficult or impossible to cope with what they are experiencing, very
											little progress will be made in this caring, and the only "solutions" offered will
											be confinement and mind suppressing drugs.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											When the destroyer HMS Saumarez, in which I was serving, was mined, a number
											of my friends and shipmates were killed. From time to time it is represented, by
											familiar turns of phrase or by allusions to known incidents, that one or more of
											them is "present". It is suggested that they have been trained to be capable of
											intruding and maybe tormenting. This raises the much larger question of what happens
											to a mass of people, mainly young men, who have not "lived" while still alive, who
											have died in such numbers in world wars: a question which is too vast to be explored
											here.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											It is suggested that the constant intrusions and my responses to them are training
											for unwelcome spirits to intrude into other people. At one time, when the intrusions
											were at their most intense and frequent, there were many occasions in which there
											was rapid and "point scoring" mental repartee during which I had numerous occasions
											in which I felt that I had "game, set and match", following which the above suggestion
											would sometimes be made. One automatically assumes that there are "regular" individuals
											actively involved, with a changing group of "extras". The point is, one cannot possibly
											know; a concept that will be explored as fully as I reasonably can in the main body
											of my writing.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											They sneer at, or denigrate, people by class, activity, uselessness, aristocratic
											status, and gender. They introduce every obvious double entendre under the sun;
											every possible allusion to a sexual connotation or feminine appearance.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											On one occasion a female friend who was visiting asked me to help her to accomplish
											something personal and intimate which she could not achieve because of the difficulties
											of looking and reaching simultaneously. Having been married more than once, and.
											having brought up a daughter and step-daughter, I have no problem or embarrassment
											with female exposure or anatomy; but while I was delicately preoccupied I felt an
											intrusion, or more specifically, an insinuation, into myself. Almost immediately
											I was totally suffused by someone else's embarrassment, and female embarrassment
											at that. "Who" had been persuaded to intrude and by "whom", and under what pretext,
											I have obviously no way of knowing.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Over the years since voice hearing began a certain number of "trigger" words
											have become established, any one of which, if intruded into my mind, is guaranteed
											to start me thinking about a particular person or circumstance. Whether I continue
											with that line of thought is up to me, once I realise that I have been prompted,
											but it is so easy automatically to follow a prompt without immediately realising
											that one had been thus triggered.</p>
										<p>
											Some of the words, in no special order, are: Tigger, up-front, Jacqueline, Alexander,
											davenport, ferret, Cole Island, Bosanquet, Nicholas, Setty, "the mem". On occasions,
											the trigger might appear to be used to indicate that a friend or acquaintance, now
											deceased, is near, and wants to make their presence known. The allusion may seem
											somewhat oblique, or at times to be clever - as when recently the word "gridiron"
											was fed into my thought. It required me to know that the original Saint Lawrence
											had been roasted alive on a gridiron, and that that was his "symbol" - which might
											be meant to indicate the near presence of a long-ago friend Lawrence B- . How possibly
											can one know?
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											I had a friend who was a long time a-dying from an inoperable brain tumour.
											My friend was nursed for some time in his home where I used to visit him, and where
											one found him obsessed with his catheter and fears about its possible leakage, and
											with an array of tissues which he classified as "dabber, mopper and wiper". Following
											his death I went early to the crematorium and arrived before the coffin. The "catafalque"
											thus being bare it had a burnished brass sheen which made it look like some ancient
											priestly altar, and as I was taking in this scene my friend's "voice" in my mind
											said dramatically "O Ra! O Osiris!", and "chuckled". Next, as I was checking the
											availability of my handkerchief against the inevitable moisture in the eyes, I "heard"
											"Have you got your dabber and mopper and wiper?", and a moment later - "Have you
											got the regulation lump in the throat?".
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Following my friend Val's untimely death I was standing shaving one morning
											and suddenly her unmistakable "voice" was in my mind saying "Can't catch me I'm
											a bumble-bee". The sort of joke she would have made.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											In the field of bird-watching reference is made to the "jizz" of a bird, i.e.
											those essential features which become imprinted on the mind of a keen watcher and
											which, even though a bird has only been glimpsed momentarily, nevertheless can lead
											to identification. If you think about it, certain people have "jizzes", and these
											can be introduced into the minds "eye" and cause one to start thinking about the
											person, or even to believe that the deceased person is present in spirit. One who

											It is all too easy to dwell upon the presence of the voice intrusions. Far more
											insidious, and possibly ever present, is the mute physical "overlap". Try to imagine
											a not quite exact "fit", so that in every movement or reaction there is just the
											little bit of anticipation or lag; of speeding up when it is inappropriate; of not
											being quite in phase on a turn; of causing forward movement when there are obstacles
											to be negotiated - whether by deliberate intent or lack of "skill" it is impossible
											to say. When the presence is continuous or frequently in and out it can become positively
											loathsome and one longs to be rid of it. If you have a copy, read in the Thousand
											and one Nights the story of the Old Man of the Sea. Sinbad, shipwrecked and alone
											as usual, stumbles across an old man who asks for help to cross a stream. Sinbad,
											in his kindness, takes the old man on his back, and then when the stream is crossed
											finds himself in a stranglehold, beaten about the head, made to go this way and
											that, by day and night, at the old man's whim; be-skittered and be-pissed all down
											his back and generally befouled. It is only ultimately by making some wine from
											wild grapes and getting the man drunk that Sinbad is finally freed, and one can
											sense the ultimate release as he crushes the man's skull with a boulder. Many times
											have I wished for that boulder! It is possible from one's own reactions to these
											presences to understand how it is that individuals will harm themselves in an effort
											to get at or get rid of this gross intrusion that is only reachable within their
											own body.

											Some time after the collapse of my first marriage, I took the plunge again and
											married a widow who had two teenage children. By nature, I am an optimistic person,
											looking for the positive in a relationship, and, probably na&iuml;vely, not looking
											ahead to the possibility of incompatibility or of serious dissent. Thus the prospect
											of sharing my newly acquired home and its four acres of land with someone who had
											similar interests in horses and the development of a smallholding, seemed to have
											a lot going for it. With my guard totally down, I made my newly acquired family
											completely free of the establishment and facilities in an endeavour to let them
											integrate totally, and feel wanted. Without going into detail, in a short time I
											found myself overwhelmed. With their own lines of communication well established,
											I found that preferences were being decided and acted upon in a manner which excluded
											me from the process, with the result that gradually I began to feel submerged and
											almost an alien in my own home. Worst of all was to have one's every action observed
											and analysed, and possibly commented upon or reported back. Remarks such as "I wouldn't
											do it that way" began to intrude: "The person who taught me to drive ..." or similar
											comments were delivered in a manner that always presumed the superiority, or personal
											"omniscience" of the lady.</p>
										<p>
											The result was that very soon I found myself, at almost all times, living in anticipation
											of some remark or action that reflected or rebounded upon what I may have said or
											done. I had the constant inward feeling akin to "looking over my shoulder", in expectation
											of some sort of intervention. In extreme instances, it was possible to find oneself
											unable to think a plan through or to make a rational decision, and even, as a result,
											to come to a total and dithering stop. These and similar reactions (or lack of actions)
											might occur even when the antagonising influence was not actually present, but in
											the offing or about to return. I sought isolation and longed for the "space" and
											independence for my own thoughts and actions, free from observation and comment;
											free from the intruding voice and presence.</p>
										<p>
											The arrival of the voice in the mind and the presence within the body, may be instant
											and very obvious, as they were in my case, or they may appear as if by subtle and
											gentle infusion over time, in such a way that the "host" may never be sure when
											they actually arrived, or, indeed, whether they had always been present. With the
											awareness that there is, seemingly, a powerful spiritual or "different" influence
											in ones life, it is possible that one feels flattered at being chosen, particularly
											as a feeling of "warm solicitousness" may be being created simultaneously. As within
											the analogous situation of my second marriage, it is difficult to be certain subsequently
											when things began to change - when the presence and association once welcome and
											sought, became so unwelcome, aggravating and dominating. As I look back through
											the thirty years that have passed since I began that short-lived marriage, it is
											quite remarkable how the intrusive voices and presences that I had brought into
											my household match the voices and presences that subsequently have invaded my mind
											and body.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Recalling some of the residual memories of that marriage, one that remains strong
											is that of the almost instantaneous negative response to many proposals or suggestions
											that I may have made at various points in our daily activities. If not an actual
											negative response, then one that implied dissent or some similar unenthusiastic
											reaction. It is quite uncanny how the intrusive interventions that I experience
											currently mirror those of the former marital situation. Far more subtle than many
											of the intrusions that I have previously described, it has become a feature of much
											of my waking time. When I was young, my father had a way of saying "What do you
											want to do that for?" - not quite negative, but sufficiently off-putting to dampen
											one's enthusiasm. In like manner I experience the undermining negativity from the
											intrusive source - and not just into my mind, but via a subtle physical ambience
											as well. As with other ploys, the perpetual negative presence has the effect of
											creating in me an "underdog" feeling that hunches the shoulders and minimises breathing.
											This type of intrusion, as with many others that I describe, is only discernable
											because my experiences of almost twenty-five years have educated me in the subtleties
											that can be employed; someone who has not become aware of such ploys will, nevertheless,
											experience the negativity, and respond accordingly.

											Long gone are the blatant obscenities and intruded salacious thoughts. Quite
											the reverse, really. If I choose at any time to indulge in any salacious mental
											activity, I am immediately and forcefully subjected to a physical presence and ambience
											of censoriousness, and never quite know whether it comes from genuine and "wholesome"
											presences, or from others as a form of trickery. As I have indicated many time previously,
											whether from a "good" or "bad" source, I just do not want intrusions of any sort
											or disposition moving at random into my mind and body, but simply want my clear
											unadulterated mind in which to think my own thoughts and reminisce in complete and
											utter privacy. In the field of "spirit release" it is an essential that should be
											borne in mind by those who are active practitioners - namely that in certain cases
											one is trying to dislodge an independently acting, intelligent "entity", one that
											can seemingly come and go at will, and that, frankly, has absolutely no intention
											of being "led to the light"!
