								<h4>The moving finger writes ...</h4>

								<p>
									When I first began to describe my experiences, I had no plan to write what you have
									read so far. Initially I wrote in order to try to help individuals who had begun
									to "hear voices" and who were also experiencing some or all of the other phenomena
									generally associated with what is commonly called schizophrenia. As fast as I wrote,
									my screen was avidly read by friends who currently work in branches of psychiatry.
									As my account unfolded - an account of events that began in 1979 - my friends wanted
									to know about "before".</p>
								<p>
									You have just read about "before", which ended in or about 1976. As I wrote of those
									times I became concerned that someone reading about the events of 1979 et sec might
									conclude that they arose as a result of my earlier experiences, and might write
									them off as the experiences of a "damaged" mind. I am as certain as I can ever be
									about anything that the only connection between the two parts of my history is that
									they occurred to and in me.
								</p>
								<p>
									In order to try to create a break in thinking and any consequential linking, I wrote
									the section just ended ("When I use a word ...") <span class="footnote">
										<a href="chapter-03.htm">[chapter 3]</a></span> And there were Giants in those
									days"). The former enabled me to philosophise a little about my relationship with
									psychiatrists and psychiatry. This next section, while providing a break, will also
									enable me to introduce some information and speculation that are both necessary
									when I come to what will be the penultimate part of my work.</p>
								<p>
									Because I know where the writing is taking me, I know that the information will
									be necessary for a full understanding. However, I know from the comments of some
									who have already read the following, that I might be in danger of losing you as
									a reader. I ask you most strongly to <i>try</i> to stick with it even though as
									you read you may wonder how any of it can <i>possibly</i> be of relevance in the
									field of mental health and the care of the disturbed.
								</p>
								<p>
									All that I can say now is that I ask you to ponder the fact that we as humans are
									the product of all that has gone before in our evolution, and that every aspect
									of our physical, mental and spiritual life and previous development, impact upon our current state of being.
									Thus something as mundane as diet, or as esoteric as our interaction with our total
									environment - physical and electrical - can dictate how we react physically and
									mentally. Everything reacts with everything else - and we are piggy in the middle!</p>
								<p>
									An understanding of our precarious place in evolution can help us to mould our lives
									in such a way that we minimise our chances of ill health, or can help us to recover
									from any distressful state into which we have succumbed. So as you read remember
									that this is my goal. If you can't cope or fail to see the relevance, just skip,
									although unfortunately much of what comes later when I am providing information
									about survival strategies might be lost on you. I'll leave it to you ...

									For as long as I can possibly remember, I have been fascinated by water. Not, in
									spite of my mother's exhortations, the sort that would have removed the tide-mark
									from around my neck, but the sort that harboured fishes; that provided a home and
									food supply for wildfowl; but, most of all, the sort on which boats plied, on which
									ships sailed. Given the chance, I would have spent my days in a boat.
								</p>
								<p>
									I sailed and tried to build model yachts, and read about them, and drooled over
									catalogues of fittings - <i>goosenecks</i> and <i>deadeyes</i> and the rest - whose
									use on <i>real</i> vessels I could only guess at. I read, read, and lived it all
									-the voyages of <i>Lightning, Flying Cloud, Thermopylae, Cutty Sark - The Fight of the
										Firecrest</i> - the voyages of Joshua Slocum. So much did I absorb and live
									what I read that, when I first took the tiller of a small boat, I <i>knew</i> what
									the feel of a weather helm would be, where the wind would be on my cheek and how
									the luff of the sail would lightly shiver as we sailed close-hauled.
								</p>
								<p>
									What a day of memories in the making! What a day. The Naval Division at Glasgow
									University had acquired sailing facilities on a loch just north of Glasgow and,
									as well as sailing dinghies on loan, had "won" a whaler - an open sea-boat of about
									21 feet long, and built on the lines of the Viking vessels - high bow and stern
									and swept lines. It was a bright, scudding April day: blue sky and clouds - and
									the <i>feel</i> of a boat under sail. What can I say?
								</p>
								<p>
									I have sailed in many small boats since, and in many places - Famagusta, Haifa,
									around Britain - yet nothing can override or extinguish the memories of that first
									time. And to cap it all, the setting. The loch was in a hollow as the land rose
									around it, and on the brae beside the water, the field was being worked with horses,
									while a man scattered seed two-handed - the Lutterell Psalter come to life. Oh,
									how I loved it all!</p>
								<p>
									But as well as the ships and the sailing, I had an equally passionate love, and
									that was for navigation. From a second-hand bookstall in our local market I had
									bought a book on coastal navigation and, again, read and read and absorbed. When,
									then, the war gave me the chance to do what I had always wanted, to go to sea, and
									I joined the Navy, with the hope of getting a commission as I have related, I found
									before me another chance to bring to life my daydreams and imaginings, and to add
									them to the sailing, for part of the early training involved chart-work.
								</p>
								<p>
									I revelled in the struggle with tides and currents, compass deviation and variation
									and the like, and in the feel of parallel rulers and dividers as the courses were
									laid off. As you have seen, I didn't achieve the hoped for commission but, instead,
									transferred to what was later to influence the course of my life and choice of career.</p>
								<p>
									Radar is an important adjunct to navigation and as such has to be equally reliable,
									precise. Thus the coast as shown on the radar screen has to be <i>exactly</i> as
									represented - twenty miles and bearing such and such, not give or take a mile or
									so; or plus or minus so many degrees. In that training and work with radar was born
									what has become in essence a way of life, of being in touch with reality, of having
									to be accurate, precise and reliable - the very qualities that were essential in,
									and pervaded, my whole working life in measurement and safety.</p>
								<p>
									From my love of navigation stemmed another and essentially parallel one - a love
									of maps and charts, and, by extension, a great interest in mapmakers, navigators
									and the early explorers. Travelling back in time for two millennia, one of the key
									centres for the study of all of the sciences and of astronomy and navigation, was
									Alexandria - centre also for exploration and trade. From the Alexandria of AD 150,
									came a map and a science that were to influence thought, travel and exploration
									for the next fifteen hundred years.
								</p>
								<p>
									Claudius Ptolomaeus - Ptolemy <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">
											[Wikipedia]</a></span> - was primarily an astronomer and mathematician, but
									also a geographer and cartographer. "He stands a Colossus astride the ancient world
									and his influence is even felt today", says one modern writer. With access to the
									extensive libraries of Alexandria, and with contact with the mariners who traded
									to the east and west of this hub of human activity, Ptolemy was in a position to
									map the known world. Into the accumulated data he was able to introduce an order
									or system that has since been followed by geographers in all ages; it was he who
									introduced the method and names of latitude and longitude.</p>
								<p>
									However, in certain very important elements, Ptolemy was in serious error. By his
									method of measurement, and choice of the Canary Islands for his prime meridian,
									he greatly overestimated the length of land eastward from this line, and consequently
									reduced the gap, presumed water, between Europe and Asia. Moreover, whereas the
									early Greeks had been content to leave blanks in their maps where knowledge ceased,
									Ptolemy filled in the blanks with theoretical concepts.
								</p>
								<p>
									Such actions would not have mattered so much in a lesser man, but so great was the
									reputation of Ptolemy that his theories assumed equal validity with his undoubted
									facts, and were not seriously questioned for 1,500 years. His reputation allowed
									him to influence a debate whose outcome and repercussions were to reverberate down
									the centuries. Ptolemy placed the earth at the centre of the universe, and there
									it stayed, in spite of the arguments of great minds, until the force of observation
									and truth prevailed.</p>
								<p>
									Will you not weep inside if not openly as Galileo must have done when he was forced
									to write:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
										"... but because I have been enjoined, by this Holy Office, altogether to abandon
										the false opinion which maintains that the Sun is the centre and immovable, and
										forbidden to hold, defend, or teach, the said false doctrine in any manner ... I
										abjure, curse and detest the said errors and heresies, and generally every other
										error and sect contrary to the said Holy Church&nbsp;..."</p>
									<p class="attribution">
										- Galileo Galilei</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									And will you not spare a thought for the predicament of Christopher Columbus as
									he sailed westward in the mistaken belief that the globe was as small as Ptolemy
									had indicated? And after sailing as far as your calculations deemed necessary, how
									do you come to terms with the fact that you have <i>not</i> reached Japan or the
									Indies as planned - but <i>where</i>? "Dammit", "Shiver me timbers" and other such
									vile nautical oaths, "It <i>must</i> be the Indies". And so, dear children, that
									is how the <i>West</i> Indies got their name, for that, in fact, is where Columbus
									had arrived - blame it all on Ptolemy.

									But, is it not the same in many walks of life and in many professions, that someone
									who has a certain expertise in a particular field, possibly even a very narrow field,
									is, nevertheless, assumed to be expert in a whole range of related, or even possibly
									totally <i>un</i>related topics? Television and the other media constantly expose
									us to such "instant gurus". It seems to be a form of psychological conditioning
									created by the endless chat shows and interviews, where pop-stars, sportsmen and
									sports-women, so-called "celebrities", and a whole host of others who fall into
									no particular category, are treated as if they are fountains of all knowledge and
									experience under the sun.
								</p>
								<p>
									Likewise the politicians, newspaper columnists and "agony aunts", who are always
									so readily and instantly available, and who are trotted out to comment and give
									an "informed" opinion on all that is passing across the face of the planet at that
									moment; or who are expected to be wise beyond their years, experience and knowledge;
									or to be ready with deep, psychological insights into all that ails the world.</p>
								<p>
									I have related how I came to take charge of the Training Department at the Sellafield
									establishment. From Day One, I was expected to have total knowledge of the field
									of industrial training. I was in post. I had a title. It was as if I had been initiated,
									inducted, empowered by Divine touch. The mantle had descended upon me, and, like
									a priest at his first celebration, a doctor at his first consultation, I was deemed
									capable of delivering all the "magic", an informed opinion.</p>
								<p>
									It requires a high degree of discernment to be able to decide, in real life, just
									<i>who</i> really know what they are talking about and just <i>who</i> are delivering
									whole loads of "flannel".
								</p>
								<p>
									Someone who would not qualify for the epithet "instant guru" was Sigmund Freud.
									He emerges from the field of mind exploration, mind mapping, like a latter-day Ptolemy.
									From both the popular and professional perceptions of his work, and the extent to
									which its influences thread our lives, Freud might also be classed as a Colossus,
									a modern one no less, standing astride the gateway to the mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									His thoughts and theories are all pervasive, extending into a world far beyond the
									confines of psychology and psychoanalysis, from the "Freudian slip" in speech to
									the ever-present sexual motivation, which he believed fuelled a person's thoughts,
									actions and relationships. From him have come concepts of the human mind and behaviour
									that have dominated thinking and practice in the "management" of the deviant mind
									and aberrant behaviour for a large part of the century that has just ended.</p>
								<p>
									In as much as it is necessary to try to understand some of Freud's reasoning and
									conclusions in the areas of thought and action that I felt might impinge upon my
									life, I have read and tried to comprehend with remarkable lack of success. There
									are thoughts and reasonings that I find so irrelevant to my life and my relationships
									with others, and inferred motivations which I reject so completely, that I wonder
									what was awry with the life and thought processes of the one who conceived them
									and gave them birth.</p>
								<p>
									I have a number of friends who are Buddhist and who have as their focus a centre
									near where I live, where their guru, a lama, resides. The lama is a prolific writer
									and, some would say, aims to out-rival the Dalai Lama as leader of the Tibetan Buddhists
									outside Tibet. I have read and tried to understand and see the relevance to my life
									- to anybody's life - of some of his writings. Mentally, I end up with a feeling
									that my brain is about to boil and that steam will come screaming out of my nostrils
									and ears.</p>
								<p>
									In some ways this is analogous to the reaction that I get when I read even simplified
									versions of Freud's works. They seem to have as much relevance to my thinking and
									the way in which I conduct my life, as have the tantric and metaphysical convolutions
									that come from the mind and pen of the lama.
								</p>
								<p>
									I reflect to myself that, having significantly passed my seventieth birthday, I
									have, somehow, managed to live a life that, while it has been eventful, and while
									it has contained episodes and moments that I would dearly like to go back and wipe
									out or change, has nevertheless been one in which I have experienced much happiness
									and achieved such a lot that I consider to have been worthwhile - but from which
									I shall have no problems about departing in due course. I further reflect that,
									somehow, I have managed this life without it being necessary to come to terms with
									the mysteries of the Tantra, or the equally deep and devious mysteries of the mind
									of the psychoanalyst and his interpretations of one's motives.</p>
								<p>
									Can it be that Freud's world, like that of Ptolemy, had a limited horizon? Ptolemy
									knew that his world was round, but he obviously did not know how big it was. He
									was certainly a brilliant thinker and innovator, but with such a lot of knowledge
									not available to him, he assumed too much and interpolated too much - with what
									disastrous results to those who came after him we cannot know.
								</p>
								<p>
									We shall never know, for instance, how many people disappeared off the edge of the
									known world simply because they had assumed that Ptolemy's configurations and distances
									were correct. If, for instance, you provision for a voyage according to Ptolemy's
									stated distances, and find that in reality you are travelling half as far again,
									the chances are that food will become short and you just might not return. Or you
									may simply disappear into the "terrae incognito", the "aut- <i>or</i> aust-landes",
									- the unknown, out- or east-lands, beloved of early mapmakers. (Who knows but that
									the <i>autlandes</i> may in fact be the origins of <i>Atlantis</i> - say it quickly
									out loud and see what I mean!)</p>
								<p>
									I wonder how many human minds have just disappeared off the edge of the unknown
									"world of the mind" since Freud tried to map it and set its limits? He obviously
									knew the extent of the physical world, for it had undoubtedly been well mapped before
									his life-time, but his intellectual world was very restricted, its bounds being
									the hospitals and consulting rooms, and the mainly Central European capitals.
								</p>
								<p>
									The conflicts of his world derived from artificial "territories" and potentially
									opposing loyalties. Thus were his theories accepted by some or rejected by others
									because he was an Austrian; because he was Jewish; because he was or was not a Freemason;
									because he had served under this professor, or was a product of that school of thinking;
									because he espoused and then rejected mesmerism? Who knows?
								</p>
								<p>
									But as he worked developing his early career, there were becoming known aspects
									of knowledge of the real world around him, realities which, did he but know of them,
									had always had the ability to influence the minds and physical health and behaviour
									of people. Disturbed behaviour in individuals had long been observed and, depending
									upon the culture prevailing, had been ascribed to a wide variety of causes. However,
									these external influences that were now beginning to be revealed, have only been
									seen in comparatively recent years as having this potential to upset people and
									influence their behaviour.
								</p>
								<p>
									Even if he had been aware of what was being unfolded, I wonder how much relevance
									Freud would have given to it within the context of his own work and research, for
									it would require an element of scientific and technical understanding that many,
									even to this day, do not bother to acquire.

									About to step centre stage is a man who did much to provide the means and methods
									by which knowledge of the realities of this all pervading, all surrounding world
									could be exposed and defined. And what a man!
								</p>
								<p>
									One of my heroes: at whose funeral three Nobel Laureates would address their tributes
									to "one of the outstanding intellects of the world, who paved the way for many of
									the technological developments of modern times": whose notebooks are still being
									studied by engineers who are looking to see if there are, even now, brainchildren
									of his inventive mind waiting to have life breathed into them: whose name you should
									bless each time you switch on a light, a television or radio, or, additionally,
									any electrical appliance that has a motor in it: a man who discovered much about
									the electrical nature of the air around us and the earth on which we live, and who,
									even, has a unit for the measurement of magnetism named after him: one who in a
									colourful life experimented with techniques that were the forerunners of today's
									<i>Star Wars</i> techniques, aimed at disabling enemy aircraft before they could
									drop their bombs.
								</p>
								<p>
									Born in Croatia not many miles south of Freud's birthplace; born in the same year
									as the Austrian, and surviving him by just four years, Nikola Tesla produced much
									of note, both in Europe and in the United States of America, where he eventually
									settled. It was Tesla who devised the concept of alternating current, which is now
									universal in the generation and supply of electricity, and who invented the induction
									motor, a type that powers just about everything that rotates by electrical means
									today. The scope of his work and his many patents are widely described in numerous
									books, but I intend to confine myself only to two areas of influence in our lives
									that are of relevance to my story.</p>
								<p>
									The first branch of knowledge that Tesla uncovered, and which is relevant to my
									tale, relates to various aspects of the electrical nature of the air around us and
									of the earth upon which we live. It was knowledge that allowed others to make further
									discoveries, and to open wide the doors that he had unlocked.
								</p>
								<p>
									For example, from an understanding of the behaviour of air in certain naturally
									occurring electrical situations, it can be derived that molecules of the air divide
									into two parts called ions, one positive and one negative. This can happen during
									thunderstorms and heavy rainstorms; through exposure to ultra-violet light and cosmic
									rays; beside waterfalls, or on a surf-washed shore, and in other locations and situations.
								</p>
								<p>
									In our original evolutionary state, there were very many more ions created in those
									earlier times than now, because of the naturally occurring radioactivity, which
									has subsequently been decreasing with time. We <i>need</i> a natural balance, with
									preferably an excess of negative over positive ions. Much research has been, and
									continues to be done into this topic, particularly, for example, when designing
									the living environment of astronauts or nuclear sub-mariners, but also where it
									impinges upon the wider field of human, animal and plant health.</p>
								<p>
									The relevance of this knowledge to the topics of which I am writing can be seen
									when one considers the consequences to humans and other forms of life of a gross
									imbalance between the types of ions. From the human point of view, a significant
									excess of positive ions can have a calamitous effect. (I should point out that individual
									people vary greatly in their response to the conditions that I shall outline - about
									forty percent are particularly sensitive.)
								</p>
								<p>
									The <i>specific</i> relevance to the "world" that Freud was in the process of analysing
									and mapping, the human mind and human behaviour, can be seen in the fact that the
									region of Europe in which he lived is in the path of the F&ouml;hn wind <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foehn_wind">[Wikipedia]</a></span> (as also
									is the region where Jung lived in Switzerland). It is now fully appreciated and
									understood that this wind, together with a number of other well known ones world
									wide - the Sharav, Chinook, Santa Anna, Sirocco for example - produces a severe
									excess of positive ions, a fact that now gives an actual explanation for effects
									which have long since been recognised and have passed into folklore.</p>
								<p>
									There is well researched and documented evidence that says that sensitive people,
									and other people whose response is perhaps less obvious, can be severely influenced,
									to the extent that sleeplessness, depression, suicide, aggravations of unknown origin,
									can all increase dramatically when these winds blow - or even in many cases, as
									the weather system is approaching and is yet some way off.
								</p>
								<p>
									In Switzerland and Southern Germany, people blame almost everything unusual on the
									F&ouml;hn wind - fights at home, suicides, murders, traffic accidents, depressive
									states. One can read that in Munich and many other parts of Central Europe north
									of the Alps, surgeons actually postpone major operations if a F&ouml;hn is forecast,
									because of problems with blood clotting.</p>
								<p>
									An American, Fred Soyka, experienced at first hand the effects of the F&ouml;hn
									wind, and wrote about them in his book <i>The Ion Effect</i>, which begins ...

										illness, and the kind of bottomless despair that at times even led me to flirt with
										the idea of suicide. Neither doctors nor a psychiatrist could explain what was happening
										to me, but when one said vaguely that it might be 'something electrical' in the
										air of Geneva I seized upon it as a possible explanation and spent five years travelling
										through Europe, the Middle East, and North America meeting scientists and amassing
										an awesome pile of scientific literature.</p>
									<p>
										"I made three discoveries. The first was that in certain places at certain times
										- in Geneva, in a large part of Central Europe, in southern California, alongside
										the Rocky Mountains and in at least a dozen other parts of the world - the air becomes
										sick not because of the pollution we all know about, but because of imbalances in
										the natural electrical charge of the air."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									What, then, I am suggesting is that many of the patients who were being seen by
									Freud and his Central European contemporaries were, in fact, suffering from conditions
									whose cause originated outside themselves. Unable to explain these "neuroses", it
									was perhaps logical that subjective causes should be examined, or that analysts
									should look for explanations within the often limited or circumscribed experiences
									of their own lives - possibly imbuing their patients with their own personal deficiencies
									and quirks.
								</p>
								<p>
									It must also be borne in mind that analysts and associates of patients could also
									be sensitive and react to the influences of the air imbalance, or that staff in
									hospitals for the disturbed could become aggravated and provocative, sparking off
									confrontations that would be laid, naturally, at the doors of the inmates, who,
									after all, were the ones assumed to be need in need of treatment.</p>
								<p>
									I shall write more about these and other relevant matters in later sections, relevant
									to us in Britain for, although we do not have named winds to blame, nevertheless
									we have identifiable patterns of air flow which, by their electrical nature, produce
									effects comparable to those of the F&ouml;hn and similar winds.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the meantime, I shall lightly skim over those of Tesla's discoveries that are
									relevant to my theme. He discovered, and demonstrated, that electricity can be transmitted
									through the air, and that the earth itself is an electrical conductor; and he had
									wonderful ideas for using the earth to distribute electrical energy without the
									need for cables. To digress briefly, I never fail to laugh when I read of the consequences
									of one phase of his experiments, written by English engineer J.H. Hamil:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										"Tesla's Colorado Springs tests were well remembered by local residents. With a
										200-foot pole topped by a large copper sphere rising above his laboratory, he generated
										electrical potentials that discharged lightning bolts up to 135 feet long. Thunder
										from the released energy could be heard 15 miles away in Cripple Creek. People walking
										along the street were amazed to see sparks jumping between their feet and the ground,
										and flames of electricity would spring from the taps when anyone turned them on
										for a drink of water. Light bulbs within 100 feet of the tower glowed when they
										were turned off. Horses at the livery stable received shocks through their metal
										shoes and bolted from the stalls. Even insects were affected: butterflies became
										electrified and helplessly swirled in circles, their wings sprouting blue halos
										of St. Elmo's Fire."
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									To cap it all, during one high-powered test, he completely destroyed the generator
									at the local power station. Not <i>such</i> a good day!

									The concept of the earth as a conductor of electricity may seem to be a long way
									from human mental health problems: not so. Many people are aware of the state of
									unease that can be produced by an approaching electrical storm. Part of the cause
									of the unease will undoubtedly be the increasing concentration of positive ions
									- a concentration released when lightning flashes. (Recollect the calming internal
									feelings that one experiences when a much-heralded storm has discharged its "wrath"
									and one is now surrounded by negative ions).</p>
								<p>
									Another component may be due to what are called "standing waves" that Tesla identified;
									these are peaks and troughs of energy propagated in circles like ripples on a pond
									when a pebble is dropped in. The waves centre on the storm and move with it, and
									can be measured at distances in excess of 300 miles. They can be shown to produce
									unease in people who would themselves be totally unaware of a cause that was so
									far away. (The disturbance in the behaviour of animals while a storm is yet far
									off is often noticed and demonstrates that they are reacting to something that is
									real and not subjective.)
								</p>
								<p>
									Internal disturbance produced by an event as obvious as a thunderstorm can be understood
									and accepted; similar effects resulting from something unseen such as a <i>distant</i>
									storm may induce significant unease in a sensitive person sufficiently to affect temporarily their mental balance.</p>
								<p>
									Staying with the natural world, and also with the earth as a conductor, we return
									to central Europe - Bavaria perhaps, and to the work of a number of people, of whom
									the one who has described it in an available book is Count Gustav von Pohl. Von
									Pohl's book, <i>Earth Currents: Causative Factor of Cancer and Other Diseases</i>,
									makes interesting reading, particularly in the context of my writing, because some
									of the "other diseases" may be classed as "nervous", psychiatric.</p>
								<p>
									Earth currents are a reality, as are the <i>ley-lines</i> of Alfred Watkins to which
									I referred earlier. It is an immensely great pity that the two have become merged
									into one concept. The amalgamation is now what many people refer to as ley-lines.
									It is a pity because the "Watkins" lines, as he himself described them, should be
									of value to anyone interested in the movement and communication of people in times
									as far past as pre-Roman, whereas knowledge and understanding of earth currents
									and their potential to influence adversely people's health, should be at the disposal
									of, and accepted by everyone concerned with human and animal well being.</p>
								<p>
									It is unfortunate that a significant number of people have little or no scientific
									and technological knowledge, and are "switched off" at the prospect of having to
									try to understand anything electrical. This is doubly unfortunate because every
									living thing is a construct of electro-chemical and bio-electronic processes. Furthermore,
									the planet on which these life processes take place is itself a gigantic electrical
									machine. The molten iron core behaves like a huge self-exciting dynamo that effectively
									creates a bar-magnet whose poles produce the earth's north and south magnetic poles.
									Consequent upon this are the lines of magnetic force associated with all magnets.
									The lines are conventionally accepted as flowing from the north to the south poles,
									and have an average strength of 50 micro-teslas.</p>
								<p>
									At the latitude of the British Isles, they emerge from the ground at an angle of
									about eighty degrees to the horizontal, then pass the equator parallel to the surface,
									re-entering the ground at a similar angle at the latitude of Patagonia, with varying
									angles of emergence or descent at other latitudes. The presence of a constant and
									homogeneous magnetic field is necessary for healthy life, for this is one of the
									background conditions of evolution. When I discuss this concept in more detail in
									later sections, I shall draw attention to experiments and speculations concerned
									with the effect on life forms of an absent or modified field.</p>
								<p>
									Taking the reality of the earth as a gigantic rotating electrical machine a step
									further, one is faced with the fact that all such machines produce attendant lines
									of electro-magnetic force. In general, these lines form regular matrixes over the
									surface of the globe, and have been classified as "Hartmann" and "Curry" grids respectively.
								</p>
								<p>
									Where one grid interacts with the other, local "electro"-stresses are produced that
									can have the effect in life forms of producing what has come to be known as "geopathic
									stress". Many people are sensitive to these locations and cannot bear to remain
									in them; others are unaware, but nevertheless react internally, and in time may
									become ill. If, as might easily happen, it is suggested that such illnesses are
									of psychosomatic origin, it is well to remember that animals and plants also react
									and may suffer.</p>
								<p>
									If the earth were completely homogeneous, that might be the end of the story as
									far as the currents that originate locally are concerned, but as it is not, other
									processes prevail. As an example, consider the situation in which of two different
									types of rock abut against each other - possibly granite against limestone. In the
									presence of water, the effect of an electrical battery would be created, and, if
									a suitable conductor existed, a current would flow. Such a conductor could be an
									underground aquifer, which, when a current flowed, would be capable of producing
									its own local "stream" of geopathic forces.
								</p>
								<p>
									Any forces produced would add to the effects of the previously mentioned Curry and
									Hartmann grids that might cross its path. In a similar manner, underground fault
									lines and ore deposits provide conducting paths that, again, would create variations
									in the grid-induced stresses.</p>
								<p>
									However, the earth is not alone; our parent sun exerts a wide range of electrical
									effects upon us, apart from giving us light and heat. The sun generates ultraviolet
									rays that have the effect of ionising the gases in our attendant space. The ions
									so created are whisked along at colossal speed in the jet streams of the upper atmosphere.
									Where there exists a flow of charged particles, there exists an electrical current.
									Essentially, the jet streams create very large currents (at times, as much as 500,000
									amperes at local noon) flowing at high speed parallel to the surface of the earth,
									and which, in turn, have a number of significant consequences.</p>
								<p>
									The first and most influential result is the creation of currents within the ground
									by a process known as "induction", and which, in a similar manner to the "battery"
									currents, seek the path of least resistance. (The path of least resistance was dramatically
									demonstrated in 1989, when a huge burst of solar electrical energy hit Canada in
									a region where there are vast tracts of granite, itself a very poor conductor of
									electricity. Taking the line of least resistance, the solar electricity burst down
									the main electrical distribution system and blew all the protection equipment, depriving
									eight million homes of their power supply for up to a week.)</p>
								<p>
									The charged particles created by ultraviolet rays in our stratosphere recombine
									when the sun goes down and the currents from this source cease. The jet streams
									themselves are also a variable phenomenon, and move back and forth across the latitudes
									with the seasons, producing passing reactions at ground level that may be a component
									in the ailments that affect many people at different seasons of the year.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the latitudes of the British Isles, the jet streams flow roughly from southwest
									to northeast, which is also the direction of flow of many of our weather systems
									and winds. The parallel flowing of the two masses of air, one high and, effectively,
									an electrical current, the other low and near the surface, causes the latter to
									adopt particular electrical characteristics derived from the former, reminiscent
									of, but not the same as, the F&ouml;hn wind. The surface air movement from the southwest
									forms one of the winds that I mentioned earlier, within which people who are sensitive
									experience specific reactions that I shall describe in detail in the appropriate
									later section.</p>
								<p>
									As I write, and then review what I have written, I am consciously aware that many
									who will read my words will find themselves in strange territory. Many will query
									the relevance of what I am writing to mental health, and ultimately, to the understanding
									of voice hearing and allied phenomena. Perhaps some may feel that they are in danger
									of becoming lost in an intellectual maze. I am aware also that I have studied and
									discussed these topics for over twenty years, and live in daily familiarity with
									my studies and observations. To you who find yourselves in a mental maze, let me
									say that, just as Theseus was able to move through the maze of Minos by following
									the thread provided by Ariadne, so also is there a thread running through all that
									I am writing in this particular section.
								</p>
								<p>
									The thread is this: many individuals who are deemed to be mentally ill are not <i>intrinsically</i>
									ill, but are reacting with a greater or lesser sensitivity to external phenomena.
								</p>
								<p>
									I can only really hint in this part of my narrative at the extent and all-pervasiveness
									of these various phenomena, and as I read and study even more deeply myself, I realise
									that there is so much yet to comprehend. I shall try to present a more detailed
									analysis in later sections, but hope that I am succeeding now in showing that, outside
									ourselves, and totally outside our control, there are major sources of influence
									upon our physical and mental well-being and behaviour.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have been asked many times by individuals to whom I have introduced this topic,
									"What is the point of even considering, let alone trying to understand these phenomena
									when they are effectively outside one's control?" The answer is given by those who
									suffer acutely from the induced effects, and who then realise that <i>they themselves</i>
									are not intrinsically ill, but are reacting to external stimuli that have a <i>limited
										duration</i>.
								</p>
								<p>
									There is no longer the recourse to the bottle, whether of tranquillisers or alcohol,
									but, instead, the realisation and acceptance that in a few hours, or a day or so,
									depending upon the particular phenomenon, the symptoms will pass and normality will
									return. Seeing a life re-emerge after being in a state of inexplicable suppression,
									makes worthwhile for me the many hours spent in observation and study.

									While the one giant was defining human mental aberrations, and arriving at conclusions
									that I speculate are flawed because he was not in possession of all the facts, my
									other giant, Tesla, together with other of his well-known contemporaries, was causing
									great benefits to be introduced into our lives, together with a then unforeseen,
									and now continually expanding, range of problems.
								</p>
								<p>
									The great benefits are those resulting from the "domestication" of electricity.
									The problems result from the adverse effects upon human physical and mental health
									of all the means of distribution of electricity and all the appliances and processes
									that we gladly embrace - and which add to the "pollution" of our homes, workplaces
									and general environment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Just as life without motor vehicles would now be unthinkable so likewise would be
									life without electricity. However, whereas the majority of life- and limb-threatening
									problems associated with the former have been identified and tackled, many of the
									problems that derive from the latter are ignored or frankly denied.</p>
								<p>
									Just as the tobacco manufacturers and their apologists go through a weird process
									of truth manipulation in the casuistry of denial of health risks, so equally do
									the spokes-people for the electrical utilities and their retained researchers. However,
									you have a personal computer, you have access to the Internet; there are hosts of
									entries under such topics as "electro-magnetic fields", "electricity and health"
									- use your ingenuity - go surf!
								</p>
								<p>
									If you are unwilling or unable to read and explore yourself, just observe. Does
									an overhead fluorescent tube give you a headache or make you feel confused? How
									do you feel in bed with an electric under- or over-blanket switched on? If you stand
									close to your microwave oven when it is running, do you get an odd feeling in your
									head or central chest?
								</p>
								<p>
									I am not writing this to <i>alarm</i> you, but to <i>alert</i> you. If you <i>understand</i>
									a little about the potential hazards, and learn how to use the benefits and minimise
									the risks, all will be well. Can you do without your bedside radio-alarm? That unexplained
									early morning headache or depression might vanish. Have you developed night-time
									breathing problems, asthma even? Consider removing that television and/or computer
									from the bedroom. If you are pregnant, whatever you do, do not use an electric blanket
									through the night; use it to warm the bed then remove it totally.</p>
								<p>
									Every effort is made to deny that there are problems with overhead cables and distribution
									in general, but the electrical fields generated can be measured or computed, and
									certainly cannot be wished away nor denied.
								</p>
								<p>
									Rationality and reason should take over, particularly amongst those who study mental
									health and when considering, for instance, the inexplicable decline of certain people.
									Take the case of someone living on the ground floor of a tower block in a flat adjacent
									to where the main electrical feed enters. The field generated by the current supplying
									all of the flats can be huge, and is known to affect individuals and cause conditions
									such as depression, or others resembling M.E.
								</p>
								<p>
									If the flats, for example, have under floor electric heating, this is switched on
									and off, on and off, on and off... through the night as thermostats and demand dictate,
									and a switched field is often worse than one in a steady state. I keep referring
									to the fact that I am very sensitive to my electrical environment, and I know from
									experience that I would find such a location intolerable.</p>
								<p>
									It was my own acute sensitivity that alerted me to consider a possible cause of
									the death from motor neurone disease (mnd) of my friend and former G.P., Sandy.
									My visits to my local health centre are infrequent, but each time that I went I
									became aware of internal feelings that, over time, I have come to associate with
									electricity or geopathic stressors. The feelings are such that I prefer not to use
									the patients' waiting room and remain in my car or sit on a bench near by.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was while I was using the bench that my eyes were opened to the source of my
									disquiet. An electricity distribution pole stands near the corner of the building.
									One cable runs down the pole, under the consulting room and eventually feeds a small
									housing estate. Another feeder passes overhead parallel with the roof of the building
									and supplies more local houses. The <i>voltage</i> presents no problem, being simply
									that of normal domestic supply. It is the <i>current</i> that is carried by a cable
									that creates the harmful electromagnetic (em) field.</p>
								<p>
									Where Sandy sat, he had an electrical feeder approximately two metres to one side,
									which then turned and went below him at a distance of about one metre. The overhead
									line ran at a distance of about two metres from his head. I have an instrument that
									detects em fields and it shows that where he sat was in a centre of high intensity.
									Sandy was very generous with his time in the consulting room - time that would inevitably
									be extended during winter months, when the electrical demand would be greatest and
									the current (and hence the em field) strongest.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have subsequently learned anecdotally of three others who had died from mnd and
									who worked or slept in locations where the em field would have been high. Two had
									operated electrical woodworking machines, and had stood close to powerful motors,
									while the third had lived in a bungalow that had under floor electrical heating.</p>
								<p>
									I wrote to the MND Foundation with my observations and received a polite reply,
									but was told that they were following entirely different lines of research, and
									did not have the resources to investigate mine. If my analysis is correct and the
									electrical field did serious and ultimately fatal damage via the nerves of the physical
									body, is it not reasonable to deduce that such a field would have a strongly adverse
									effect upon the brain and mental processes of an individual who spent time in it?

									What I am trying to do, and hope that I am succeeding in my attempts, is to demonstrate
									that there have always been natural phenomena external to humans which, when they
									have operated, have caused unquantifiable disturbances in human behaviour. The existence
									of an external cause being unknown, people have been treated as if they were inherently
									out of control or even mad.
								</p>
								<p>
									From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, other developments have caused to be introduced
									into industrialised human life, artificial, man-made additions to the natural phenomena,
									introductions that have resulted in much more serious disturbance, and a vast increase
									in apparent mental illness.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is so very unfortunate that the serious analysis of the aberrant human mind,
									that also began roughly in the mid-nineteenth century, has developed and has continued
									without a knowledge of, or subsequent recognition of, the contribution to mental
									disruption of many of the adverse external influences.</p>
								<p>
									I have noted above, and will describe more fully later, some of the direct results
									and possible harmful effects of the introduction of electricity into our lives and
									homes. My intention now is to illustrate some of the <i>indirect</i> consequences
									of the wide availability and greater use of electricity in all sorts of situations
									and processes, with a potential to cause harm that I am certain that Tesla and his
									contemporaries could never have envisaged.</p>
								<p>
									The development of steam-powered pumps had already begun the process of bringing
									piped water into towns and homes. The increasing availability of electrically operated
									pumps did much to speed up the spread of such a desirable innovation.
								</p>
								<p>
									Unfortunately, every benevolent advance seems to have a downside, and one of the
									negatives of this progressive leap was the introduction of lead into people's lives
									via the domestic water pipe. Brought into use in the latter half of the nineteenth
									century and only, in Britain, phased out in the equivalent half of the twentieth
									century, lead pipes created an unwelcome and potentially harmful addition to the
									"diet". The effect of gross lead poisoning was already well known, but what the
									civic engineers and medical watchdogs were unaware of were the harmful effects of
									chronic low-level exposure; i.e., at a level insufficient to produce "classical"
									lead poisoning.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are a number of medical problems, such as stillbirths and heart disease that
									have been shown to be caused by low-level lead poisoning. In the context in which
									I am writing, the interaction of lead within the nervous system is very significant,
									creating, as it does, learning and behavioural deficits, as, also, is its implication
									in the generation of delinquent and criminal behaviour - themselves often the result
									of poor mental development.</p>
								<p>
									"General malaise" - a portmanteau and convenient term standing for the vague symptoms
									of depression, muscle aches and pains, lethargy and frequent infections - together
									with immune dysfunction, can all be laid at the door of low-level lead poisoning.
									When one considers that acid rain, increasing in volume over the century, has leached
									increasing amounts of lead out of domestic pipes, is it any wonder that more and
									more people have consulted their doctors with such a catalogue of vague symptoms
									as those listed, and, there being no obvious cause, have then gone away with a so
									called "happy pill"?
								</p>
								<p>
									Lead levels in people have increased and continue to increase, for, additionally,
									lead has been well and truly introduced into the atmosphere, and atmospheric lead
									knows no boundaries. Does it surprise you that, in industrial nations, our body
									lead levels have increased to between 500 and 1000 times those of our ancestors?
									Does it surprise you that so many people, exhibiting all of these vague symptoms
									that could be laid at the door of lead, end up being treated for that catch-all
									condition "depression"? Does it surprise you that so many people become addicted
									to their resultant anti-depressants and never dare to relinquish them?

									Lead ingestion is not the only downside of municipal water. In earlier days, water
									was obtained from springs and wells - from deep in the ground, where it had had
									a chance to capture some of the minerals that are so necessary for a healthy life.
								</p>
								<p>
									Gradually the wells and springs were abandoned in favour of the piped water, and,
									in many ways, health improved with the eradication of waterborne disease. Unfortunately,
									in many new catchment areas the water was unable to acquire the desirable minerals,
									resulting in depletion that may have contributed insidiously to deterioration in
									health in other ways, and in mental health in particular.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have drawn attention to Seascale, the village in which I lived for a time. Until
									1976, it, and the surrounding area, derived a water supply from Wastwater, the not
									far distant lake. In the period when Calder Hall Nuclear Power Station was being
									designed, I had access to an analysis of this water, for it was to be used as the
									boiler feed-water in the process of steam generation.
								</p>
								<p>
									To my astonishment, I found that it was almost totally devoid of minerals. The rain
									ran quickly over insoluble rock, and stayed locked in a deep and unmixing basin.
									One can only guess at the adverse effect upon health that this may have had, particularly
									in respect of people who had moved to the area from, for example, a limestone or
									chalk water-catchment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Past glaciations had already depleted the soil of vital but soluble nutrients, and
									minerals that one would normally expect to get from one's water supply were doubly
									absent. (Local farmers give a wide range of mineral supplements to their stock -
									magnesium, selenium, copper, cobalt, for example. But humans? Perhaps if humans
									had a marketable value someone might ensure a <i>truly</i> balanced diet; but humans
									are meant to be responsible, intelligent beings with sufficient free will to take
									responsibility for their own diets, aren't they? Oh dear!).</p>
								<p>
									I am trying not to get too involved with aspects of diet and mental health at this
									stage, but plan to visit the subject in more detail where it becomes relevant to
									my own experience and observation, particularly in respect to my determination to
									take responsibility for my own health and well being. However, where the mushrooming
									technology of living has introduced an alien input into one of the sources of good
									mental health, our food, my object is to bring it into view and return in more detail
									at a later stage.

									Another alien intrusion into healthy life that arrived courtesy of freely available
									electricity is aluminium. In its naturally occurring form in soil, aluminium is
									very widely present and humanity must have evolved being tolerant of this substance,
									or even using it metabolically in its natural evolution.
								</p>
								<p>
									Even if this is so, I have been unable to find any reference to the beneficent use
									of aluminium in the body's metabolism. The greater availability of electricity allowed
									the large-scale extraction of <i>metallic</i> aluminium from its ore, bauxite, and
									its widespread dispersion in the forms of cooking-ware, cans and containers.
								</p>
								<p>
									In terms of human health, I can find nothing to be said in its favour, the reverse
									in fact, for everything points to it being inimical to life. Much has been written
									about the possible contribution of aluminium to, for example, Alzheimer's disease.
								</p>
								<p>
									A more overt and practical demonstration of the adverse effects of the metal came
									from a friend who built yachts with hulls made of the metal. If he ever cut himself
									on it, the wound took an unconscionable time to heal, with the aluminium seemingly
									acting as an <i>inhibitor</i> of the natural life processes.</p>
								<p>
									Here is a little conundrum for you to puzzle over while you nibble your after-dinner
									mint. Sodium and potassium are very close to each other chemically and functionally,
									and if one ingests too much sodium, then potassium cannot be retained in correct
									balance (classic heart and stroke advice).
								</p>
								<p>
									Aluminium and magnesium are also very close to each other on the Periodic Table
									of the Elements, and exhibit many properties in common. In the processes of human
									metabolism, if there is insufficient magnesium present to fulfil the body's requirements,
									and if there is available aluminium, does the latter mimic the former and find its
									way into the cellular and other activity of the body, and if so, with what consequences?
								</p>
								<p>
									Many people when the question is put say that it seems a reasonable supposition,
									but no one has yet been able to say whether I am correct or not. (A report that
									I read recently described the results of the examination of the brains of people
									who had died from Alzheimer's disease. Where aluminium was present in the tissues,
									there was an equivalent depletion in magnesium).</p>
								<p>
									Every modern source that I read describing various approaches and analyses of dietary
									needs, stresses that in Britain, mainly because of past glaciations, magnesium is
									poorly available, and that unless one has a good intake of organically grown leafy,
									green vegetables, or takes supplements, one is unlikely to have a sufficient intake
									for good health.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many things follow, but in terms of mental health, listed consequences of insufficient
									magnesium are poor memory, inertia, depression, anorexia to name but four. Obviously
									there is much to consider, and I am no dietary expert - a constant source book for
									me is <i>Nutritional Medicine</i> by Drs. Stephen Davies and Alan Stewart, which
									is very "accessible" to the layperson.
								</p>

									So if aluminium is replacing magnesium, what then? The thought often crosses my
									mind as I see someone slurping on a soft drinks can. Such intimate contact with
									the metal of a can that contains phosphoric acid - what then? Yes it does. After
									carbonated water and sugar, phosphoric acid is the next major ingredient in many
									popular soft drinks.
								</p>
								<p>
									So, does the acid leach more aluminium? I don't know, but it is well recorded that
									the phosphorus is needed in exquisite balance with calcium and magnesium for correct
									cellular function and if one gets too much of it - and if the aluminium is buggering
									up the magnesium ...
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm just glad that it is not my problem. But at another level it is, for since some
									of the drinks contain caffeine in quantities that can cause hyperactivity in young
									children, it becomes a <i>social</i> problem for everyone as we see a developing
									generation of hyperactive near-cretins. And since many drinks contain caramel (E150)
									as a colouring agent, and since many people are sensitive to aspirin, and since
									E150 belongs to that group which, in aspirin sensitive people, can provoke an asthma
									attack, or even induce asthma ...</p>

									Some of the same products are passed off as so-called "diet" drinks i.e. having
									reduced or no sugar. In very many cases, the sugar substitute is Aspartame. If you
									have access to the Web, simply type in that name in your search facility. The Web
									is <i>full</i> of reports and articles from many sources, the majority listing the
									ninety-plus serious medical conditions that can be induced by consumption of the
									substance. In the context of my writing, just one will suffice, namely "depression".</p>

									I have carried out a further review of what I have written so far in this section
									and I have realised that my own enthusiasm is in danger of carrying me away from
									you. Reflecting that I had observed and experimented and amassed information during
									more than twenty years, I found that I was opening the floodgates of my knowledge
									and risked overwhelming you.
								</p>
								<p>
									Consequently, I have removed and sidelined several pages of discussion and, if they
									are still relevant, will develop the contents in appendices. I had written about
									the problems that can result from the presence of mercury and nickel in the mouth
									whether incorporated in dental amalgam or certain types of tooth crown - problems
									that can be of a general nervous and psychiatric nature. I had also drawn attention
									to the effects created by the presence of iron in our lives where it occurs in building
									construction and central heating radiators.
								</p>
								<p>
									Although it may not be obvious now, nevertheless I shall justify my inclusion of
									these topics and others that I have removed when later I include and explore them.
									They were all part of the thread of continuity, which was in danger of becoming
									tangled!
								</p>
								<p>
									For now, I wonder whether I have succeeded in my proposition that much of modern
									psychiatry has stayed in a channel of thought created by the unintentional ignorance
									and unawareness of the early progenitors. With a mind-set having been created, how
									difficult it is to broaden the channel to accommodate new knowledge - just as in
									religion, believers in Creation refuse to accept the concept of evolution in spite
									of the evidence of fossils and the logic that supports the evidence.
								</p>
								<p>
									All that I have written or will write is based upon personal experiences, logic
									and reason and I write it to try release anyone whom I can reach through my words
									who is chained in the "creation myths" of psychiatry.
								</p>
								<p>
									While I hope that what I write will eventually be read by professionals, my principal
									purpose in writing is to reach you who are suffering or you who are trying to support
									and inspire someone whom you love and care for. Do not believe that your case is
									hopeless; do not, you carer, believe that you cannot help and motivate.
								</p>
								<p>
									If nothing from the field of mental health inspires you, look elsewhere. Here, try
									this - <i>Self Healing: My Life and Vision</i> by Meir Schneider - "The remarkable
									account of the author who cured himself of congenital blindness by discovering the
									body's own inner resources, and who taught thousands of others, some with "incurable"
									diseases to heal themselves".
								</p>
								<p>
									Meir's problem was very apparent from the time of his birth in Russia. A botched
									operation provided no improvement, and, following emigration to Israel, he was to
									be registered blind and trained as such. However, he had <i>just</i> a glimmer of
									light in his vision, and that glimmer gave him hope, and he seized it.
								</p>
								<p>
									If the book doesn't inspire you as you read of what can be achieved by sheer dogged
									insight, persistence, courage, and an innate belief in the self-healing powers of
									the human mind and body, achieved in Meir's case in the face of active opposition
									from family and authority - if this doesn't inspire you to set to work on your self
									or the one in your care, whatever will?</p>
								<p>
									I know from long hard experience that it is difficult, nigh impossible, to pull
									yourself up by your own bootstraps, but Meir shared his struggle with other allegedly
									incurable comrades, and all in their own ways achieved progress. He eventually moved
									to California and has generated a whole new movement aimed at promoting the self-healing
									potential within anyone who is motivated to try the techniques that practical experience
									and experiment have been shown to work so effectively.
								</p>
								<p>
									Meir runs courses worldwide to train teachers, and holds workshops to help individuals,
									but in addition he has produced a work manual, <i>The Handbook of Self-Healing</i>,
									that can be used by individuals themselves or by health teachers and practitioners.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you say "This is not for me, my problem is in my mind", just remember the often
									quoted saying "A healthy mind in a healthy body" [Mens sana in corpore sano] <span class="footnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_sana_in_corpore_sano">[Wikipedia]</a>
									</span>and <i>try it</i>, acknowledging also that the book does not aim solely at
									physical defects, for there is a section on creating and maintaining a healthy <i>nervous
										system</i>.</p>
								<p>
									In the part aimed at helping brain-injured children, the book quotes the work and
									practice of a renowned therapist Glenn Doman. Doman works with great success from
									his belief that progress and recovery must follow the original development pattern
									of initial arm and leg movement without body action, followed by creeping and crawling
									in sequence and finally walking, proceeding ostensibly through the initial embryo
									stages of fish, reptiles and mammals, and only achieving results if the sequential
									stages are followed in that order.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am personally very interested in Doman's concept, for I have developed a similar
									belief concerning the extent to which our evolution is still within us in <i>totality</i>.
								</p>
								<p>
									You may never think about it, but without exception, you are mammals: if you disagree,
									just look at your chest and see the externals of the mammary glands there. Albeit
									a mammal with intellect - and that is the root of the problem.
								</p>
								<p>
									The core of your behaviour and reaction is the result of millions of years of evolution
									culminating in <i>Homo erectus, habilis, neanderthalensis</i> and <i>sapiens</i>,
									and it all continues to reside in you, that incredible journey. There is still within
									you all of the essence and potential reaction to circumstances that have always
									dictated the behaviour of the component parts of the body and their response to
									external stimuli and challenges.
								</p>
								<p>
									The problem for us humans is that, having intellect, we create far more situations
									and problems than the evolving "us" had to contend with at any stage in our evolution,
									and that is at the heart of our nervous and mental problems, excluding those resulting
									from actual physical and chemical damage. Even some of the facial asymmetries that
									I shall consider later in my work may be the result of conflict between intellect
									and "inheritance". This then is the dichotomy of evolution and intellect to which
									I plan to return in due course as I attempt to unravel its influence upon our mental
									health.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the meantime, and all the while as I go about my daily chores, I wonder and speculate,
									as one does, whether the mammoths suffered from migraine; whether orang-utans in
									the wild have incurable personality problems; whether <i>homo neanderthalensis</i>
									was ever depressed or anxious and how he coped - perhaps he became extinct because
									he didn't have tranquillisers to help him come to terms with the fact that it was
									getting warmer and the sea level was rising, or maybe he received modified shock
									treatment in the form of a sharp blow to the head with a stick or club; whether
									any of our distant forebears were conscious of the concept of "spirit"; whether
									any or all had the experience of intruding voices in the mind, and what was the
									response of <i>homo habilis</i> - whether he made an improved stone axe following
									instructions from the "divine".
								</p>
								<p>
									Of course, I will never know, but I do know something about "voices" and "divine
									and malign intrusions", all of which appear in the next twist of this devious maze
									through which I am trying to lead you.
								</p>
								<p>
									At the outset, Paracelsus called us to view the bright new star of imagination:
									however, from here onwards I have to ask you to accept actual evidence, the evidence
									of personal experience, the experience that says that voices in the mind are <i>not</i>
									the product of imagination, but of a reality. This reality belongs to the people
									who actually have these experiences, and these are the people to whom you in turn
									must listen ...
