                                        <strong>A really free consciousness will not be sensual but will be sensitive &mdash;</strong>

                                        deeply sensitive and sensuous. Really, when a Buddha sees a flower, he sees the
                                        flower in its totality, in its total beauty, in its total aliveness. The colour,
                                        the fragrance, everything, Buddha sees in its totality. He will never think again
                                        about this flower &mdash; he will never be sensual. He will not hanker again to
                                        see it more and more, repeatedly. He will never think again about this flower &mdash;
                                        not because he is not sensuous, but because he is totally sensuous, and he has lived
                                        this experience so deeply that there is no need to repeat.
                                    </p>

                                        The need to repeat comes because you cannot live any moment totally &mdash; so you
                                        eat, and again you have to think to repeat it. You love, and you have to think to
                                        repeat it. You are less concerned with living than you are concerned with repetition.
                                        This repetitive hankering is sensuality.

                                        <strong>One part is biological, hereditary; another is sociological.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There is sex: become aware that the unconscious instinct is forcing your body mechanism
                                        towards a particular object, towards a particular act. But don't fight it because
                                        that fight is again, from the sociological part of the unconscious which says that
                                        sex is sin. Be aware of both, be conscious of both: there is sex, and there is the
                                        concept that sex is sin. Both are coming from some place you don't know, from a
                                        deep darkness within.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Be conscious &mdash; don't do anything! Just remain conscious. Try to be in an alert
                                        state. Don't fight with the sex, don't condemn it &mdash; don't go to indulge in
                                        it. Simply remain conscious of the fact that something is happening inside. If you
                                        can remain conscious of the fact that something is happening inside, if you can
                                        remain with the fact without dong anything, you will feel that your consciousness
                                        is growing and penetrating the dark realm of the unconscious.
                                    </p>

                                        <strong>If you are alert, two things happen: </strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The energy that was going to be used as indulgence or as suppression will become
                                        part of your alertness. Your alertness will be strengthened through that energy.
                                        That energy will move to your alertness; you will become more alert. That energy
                                        will become a fuel to your consciousness.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You will be more conscious, and for the first time the unconscious will not be able
                                        to force you. For the first time unconsciousness will be incapable of manipulating
                                        you. And once you know the feeling of this freedom, that the unconscious cannot
                                        manipulate you &mdash; without any fight, without any struggle, without any conflict
                                        &mdash; then your consciousness has become stronger.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And, by and by, the field of consciousness will grow and the field of unconsciousness
                                        will shrink. Your human iceberg will have gained one part more: you will be two
                                        parts conscious, eight parts unconscious. This is a long journey, and by and by
                                        you will become three parts conscious, seven parts unconscious. As you gain more
                                        it is just like reclaiming land from the ocean.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The unconscious is a vast ocean; you have to reclaim land inch by inch. But the
                                        moment you reclaim land, the ocean shrinks back. A day comes, just like it came
                                        to a Buddha or to a Jesus, when you are conscious all the ten parts and the unconscious
                                        has disappeared. You are just light inside and no darkness. This is the flowering.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And for the first time you become aware of your immortality. For the first time
                                        you are now not a seed. For the first time for you there is no becoming &mdash;
                                        you have become a being. If this expression can be allowed: You have become a being!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In this enlightened state of being, there is no suffering, no conflict, no misery.
                                        You are filled with bliss. Inside you are bliss, outside you are compassion. You
                                        have become sensitive to everything.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Because of that sensitivity, a Buddha is compassion outside; inside, a deep silent
                                        pool of bliss, and outside a compassion. Buddha's lips are smiling with a deep bliss,
                                        and his eyes are filled with tears &mdash; in a deep compassion. That's why you
                                        can work both ways. If you grow in consciousness, you will grow in compassion; if
                                        you grow in compassion, you will grow in consciousness.<sup>[2]</sup> But to grow

                                        So the only right path is to grow in consciousness, then compassion comes as a shadow.
                                        Otherwise you can deceive and your compassion can just be a facade, a deception.
                                        Your compassion can again be an unconscious act. Then it is sentimental, emotional
                                        &mdash; not existential. Then you can weep, you can sympathize and you can serve.
                                        But this is going to be again an unconscious thing. The surest and most certain
                                        path is to grow in consciousness.

                                        may not look at all related with sex, but they are related. The more wealth you
                                        have, the more sex you can have; it becomes more possible. The more power you have,
                                        the more sex you can have; it becomes more possible.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You may forget completely, and ends may become means and means may become ends;
                                        that's another thing. One person can go on accumulating wealth for his whole life,
                                        and he may completely forget for what he is doing it. But every power search is
                                        for sex.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We move around the center of sex, we are bound to because unless we grow in consciousness
                                        we cannot go beyond it. That is the most unconscious-rooted center, the lowest,
                                        and for that reason the deepest and the most unconscious. The higher you move in
                                        consciousness, the further you go from sex. And then there is a flowering of a different
                                        type. The whole energy moves to the seventh &mdash; sahasrar. And when the whole
                                        energy comes to the seventh chakra, it becomes a flower &mdash; one-thousand-petalled.
                                        This is a beautiful imagery. It means with unlimited, infinite petals, the flower
                                        opens.
                                    </p>

                                        It is difficult, but there is no other way. There are many methods for being aware,
                                        but awareness is necessary. There are many ways to create light &mdash; but light
                                        will have to be created. You can create a fire and there will be no darkness. And
                                        you can use a kerosene lamp and there will be no darkness, and you can use electricity
                                        and there will be no darkness. But whatsoever the case, whatsoever the method of
                                        producing light, light has to be produced.

                                        So light is a must, and whatsoever I will say in reference to this question will
                                        be about methods to produce awareness. Remember, they are not alternatives to awareness
                                        &mdash; nothing can be. Awareness is the only possibility for dispelling darkness,
                                        for dispelling unconsciousness.

                                        <strong>But how to create awareness?</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I talked about one method which is the purest: to be aware inside of whatsoever
                                        happens on the boundary line of the unconscious and to the conscious &mdash; to
                                        be aware there. Anger is there. Anger is produced in darkness; anger has roots in
                                        the unconscious.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Only branches and leaves come into the conscious. Roots, seeds, the energy source,
                                        are in the unconscious. You become aware only of faraway branches. Be conscious
                                        of these branches. The more conscious you are, the more you will be capable of looking
                                        into darkness. Inner darkness, unconsciousness, is the same. Look into it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But you can look only if you are not active. If you begin to act, your mind is distracted.
                                        Don't act inside. Anger is there &mdash; don't act, don't condemn, don't appreciate,
                                        don't indulge in it, and don't suppress it. Don't do anything &mdash; just look
                                        at it! observe it! Understand the distinction.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What happens ordinarily is quite the reverse. If you are angry, then your mind is
                                        focused on the cause of anger outside &mdash; always! Someone has insulted you &mdash;
                                        you are angry. Then there are three things: the cause of anger outside, the source
                                        of anger inside, and in between these two you are. Anger is your energy inside,
                                        the cause which has provoked your energy to come up is outside, and you are in between.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The natural way of the mind is not to be aware of the source, but to be focused
                                        on the cause outside. Whenever you are angry you are in deep concentration on the
                                        cause outside. Mahavir <sup>[3]</sup> has called Kroudha (anger) a sort of meditation.
                                        He has named it Roudra Dhyan: meditation on negative attitudes. It is! &mdash; because
                                        you are concentrated. Really, when you are in deep anger you are so concentrated
                                        that the whole world disappears. Only the cause of anger is focused.

                                        Your total energy is on the cause of anger, and you are so much focused on the cause
                                        that you forget yourself completely. That's why in anger you can do things about
                                        which, later on, you can say, "I did them in spite of myself."

                                        For awareness you have to take an about-turn. You have to concentrate not on the
                                        cause outside, but on the source inside. Forget the cause. Close your eyes, and
                                        go deep and dig into the source. Then you can use the same energy which was to be
                                        wasted on someone outside &mdash; the energy moves inwards. Anger has much energy.
                                        Anger is energy &mdash; the purest of fires inside. don't waste it outside.

                                        Take another example. You are feeling sexual: sex is again energy, fire. But whenever
                                        you feel sexual, again you are focused on someone outside, not on the source. you
                                        begin to think of someone &mdash; of the lover, of the beloved, A-B-C-D &mdash;
                                        but when you are filled with sex your focus is always on the other. You are dissipating
                                        energy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Not only in the sexual act do you dissipate energy, but in sexual thinking you dissipate
                                        it even more because a sexual act is a momentary thing. It comes to a peak, the
                                        energy is released, and you are thrown back. But sexual thinking can continuously
                                        be there. You can continue it in sexual thinking, you can dissipate energy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And everyone is dissipating energy. Ninety percent of our thinking is sexual. Whatsoever
                                        you are doing outside, inside sex is a constant concern &mdash; you may not even
                                        be aware of it. You are sitting in a room and a woman enters: your posture changes
                                        suddenly. Your spine is more erect, your breathing changes, your blood pressure
                                        is different. You may not be aware at all of what has happened, but your whole body
                                        has reacted sexually.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You were a different person when the woman was not there; now again you are a different
                                        person. An all-male group is a different group, and all-female group is a different
                                        group. Let one male come in or one female, and the whole group, the whole energy
                                        pattern, changes suddenly.

                                        You may not be conscious of it, but when your mind is focused on someone, your energy
                                        begins to flow. When you feel sexual, look at the source, not at the cause &mdash;
                                        remember this. Science is more concerned with the cause and religion is more concerned
                                        with the source. The source is always inside; the cause is always outside. With
                                        cause you are in a chain reaction. With cause you are connected with your environment.
                                        With source you are connected with yourself.

                                        This is the purest method to change unconscious energy into conscious energy: Take
                                        an about-turn &mdash; look inside! It is going to be difficult because our look
                                        has become fixed. We are like a person whose neck is paralyzed, and who cannot move
                                        and look back. Our eyes have become fixed. We have been looking outside for lives
                                        together &mdash; for millennia &mdash; so we don't know how to look inside.

                                        Do this: whenever something happens in your mind, follow it to the source. Anger
                                        is there &mdash; a sudden flash has come to you &mdash; close your eyes, meditate
                                        on it. From where is this anger arising? Never ask the question: who has made it
                                        possible? who has made you angry? That is a wrong question. Ask which energy in
                                        you is transforming into anger &mdash; from where is this anger coming up, bubbling
                                        up, what is the source inside from where this energy is coming?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Be concerned with from where anger is bubbling up, from where the sex desire has
                                        come in. Follow it, take steps backwards. Meditate silently and go with anger to
                                        the roots. It is difficult but it is not impossible. It is not easy. It is not going
                                        to be easy because it is a fight against a long-rooted habit.
                                    </p>

                                        The whole past has to be broken, and you have to do something new which you have
                                        never done before. It is just the weight of sheer habit which will create the difficulty.
                                        But try it, and then you are creating a new direction for energy to move. You are
                                        beginning to be a circle, and in a circle energy is never dissipated. The energy
                                        comes up and moves outside &mdash; it can never become a circle then; it is simply
                                        dissipated.

                                        If my movement inwards is there, then the same energy which was going out turns
                                        upon itself. My meditation leads this energy back to the same source from where
                                        the anger was coming. It becomes a circle. This inner circle is the strength of
                                        a Mahavir. The sex energy, not moving to someone else, moves back to its own source.
                                        This circle of sex energy is the strength of a Buddha.

                                        that when you become a hearer of your own sound, then you have reached. Then you
                                        have completed the japa. And there is much in it. When you hear a sound, for example,
                                        "Ram", your peripheral apparatus is used in creating it, your vocal apparatus. Or
                                        it you create a mental sound, then your mind is used to create it. But when you
                                        become alert about it, that alertness is of the center, not of the periphery. If
                                        I say "Ram", this is on the periphery of my being. When I listen to this sound "Ram"
                                        inside, that is from my center &mdash; because awareness belongs to the center.
                                        If you become aware in the center, now you have the light with you. you can dispel
                                        unconsciousness.

                                        The very first question that arises in the mind of the seeker is what to do in regard
                                        to this central principle. Now there is another possibility of this chakra, and
                                        that is brahmacharya, celibacy, which is attainable through meditation. Sex is the
                                        natural possibility, and brahmacharya is its transformation. The more the mind is
                                        focused upon and gripped by sexual desire, the more difficult it will be to reach
                                        its ultimate potential of brahmacharya.

                                        <strong>This means that we can utilize the situation given to us by nature in two ways:</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We can live in the condition that nature has placed us in &mdash; but then the process
                                        of spiritual growth cannot begin &mdash; or we transform this state.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The only danger in the path of transformation is that there is the possibility that
                                        we may begin to fight with our natural center.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What is the real danger in the path of a seeker? The first obstacle is that if the
                                        meditator indulges only in nature's order of things he cannot rise to the ultimate
                                        possibility of his physical body and he stagnates at the starting point. On the
                                        one hand there is a need; on the other hand there is a suppression which causes
                                        the meditator to fight the sex urge. Suppression is an obstacle on the path of meditation.
                                        This is the obstacle of the first chakra. Transformation cannot come about with
                                        suppression.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If suppression is an obstruction, what is the solution? Understanding will then
                                        solve the matter. Transformation takes place within as you begin to understand sex.
                                        There is a reason for this. All elements of nature lie blind and unconscious within
                                        us. If we become conscious of them, transformation begins.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Awareness is the alchemy; awareness is the alchemy of changing them, of transforming
                                        them. If a person becomes awake toward his sexual desires with his total feelings
                                        and his total understanding, then brahmacharya will begin to take birth within him
                                        in place of sex. Unless a person reaches brahmacharya in his first body it is difficult
                                        to work on the potentiality of other centers.

                                        Sex was the opening given by nature, and brahmacharya is the quest that has to be
                                        undertaken through this very opening. If you see in this perspective there is no
                                        need to beg from anywhere; understanding is what is required. All of existence is
                                        there for the purpose of understanding. Learn from anybody, hear everyone, and,
                                        finally, understand your own self within.

                                        A tension is thrown out, a load is unburdened. When the energy is thrown out a load
                                        is unburdened. When the energy is thrown out you feel dissipated. To relax is one
                                        thing, to feel dissipated is quite another. Relaxation means the energy is within
                                        and you are resting, and to feel dissipated means energy is thrown out and you lie
                                        exhausted. You are weakened with the loss of energy and you think you are relaxing.

                                        and unless you transcend sex the Brahman cannot be achieved. All other dualities
                                        are just reflections and reflections of this basic duality. Birth and death, again
                                        a duality. They will disappear when you are neither male or female. When you have
                                        a consciousness which goes beyond both &mdash; then birth and death disappear, matter
                                        and mind disappear, this world and that world disappear, heaven and hell disappear.
                                        All dualities disappear when the basic duality within you disappears, because all
                                        dualities are simply echoing and re-echoing the basic division within you.

                                        you are denying your inner woman; then you will be attracted to outer women too
                                        much. It will become a perversion because then it is a substitute. The inner femininity
                                        has been denied; now the outer femininity becomes obsessive to you. You will think
                                        and think about it; now your whole mind will become sexual. If you are a woman and
                                        you have denied the man, then "man" will take possession of you. Then whatsoever
                                        you do or think, the basic color will remain sexual.
