                                        <strong>Sex makes man a fool.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Truth is that sex makes man a fool, gives him the idea that he is the master of
                                        it, while he is only a slave. And the slavery has to be broken &mdash; he has to
                                        be pulled out of this ditch. But if he thinks that that ditch is a palace then you
                                        cannot pull him out. You cannot even persuade him to come out of it; hence, the
                                        condemnation of sex by all the religions. But they overdid it, and they forgot the
                                        ninety-nine percent dangers just for the one percent. It could have been done very
                                        easily without taking the risk of ninety-nine percent falsehood. But they saw the
                                        danger of man being simply a means, and that is the lowliest position possible;
                                        you are just a means, not an end.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>You are being used by some unknown force of which you have no idea.</strong>
                                        The man living on the instinctive level only has an hallucination of love. That
                                        hallucination is created by nature, by biology, chemistry. You have in your body
                                        drugs which are released when you are making love, and you start moving into euphoria.
                                        That is one of the reasons why people who become addicted to drugs slowly slowly
                                        become uninterested in sex.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        People become addicted to sex. And a very strange thing about addiction is that
                                        if you have the drug, it is nothing; if you don't have it, you are missing. You
                                        never think what you are missing because when you have it, it is nothing. Each time
                                        you have it you feel that it is just a futile effort, nothing comes out of it. You
                                        don't move a single inch in evolution. You just jump for a moment in the air and
                                        with a thump you fall back on the ground.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        <strong>Desires never fulfill anyone.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Buddha has said it is not the nature of desire to be fulfilled. Fulfillment comes
                                        only by desirelessness. Now, this is one of the most important paradoxes: if you
                                        drop desiring, you will be fulfilled. The more you desire, the more you are getting
                                        into desire, the farther and farther away you go from your possibility of fulfillment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One desire creates many more desires, then many more desires, millions more. It
                                        is like a tree. First it is one, then many branches, then many small offshoots,
                                        and on and on it goes. The person has asked, "I feel stuck." Everybody who has been
                                        living in desire feels stuck. The problem is that if you don't try to fulfill your
                                        desire, you remain unfulfilled. If you try, even if you get the goal of your desire,
                                        then you remain unfulfilled &mdash; then too, nothing changes. This is the nightmare
                                        of life.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        <strong>Osho on Repressed Sexuality.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And my own observation is, the moment you accept something totally, the very acceptance
                                        brings a revolution, a radical change. It is your energy &mdash; accept it. It will
                                        make you stronger. Reject it, it keeps you weak. Fighting with your own energy is
                                        dissipating it. And fighting with your sex will take so much of your time and so
                                        much of your energy &mdash; then when are you going to look at God who is knocking
                                        on your door?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Old age is the last opportunity given to you: before death comes, prepare. And how
                                        does one prepare for death? By becoming more meditative. If some lurking desires
                                        are still there, and the body is getting old and the body is not capable of fulfilling
                                        those desires, don't be worried. Meditate over those desires, watch, be aware. Just
                                        by being aware and watchful and alert, those desires and the energy contained in
                                        them can be transmuted.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But before death comes, be free of all desires. When I say be free of all desires
                                        I simply mean be free of all objects of desires. Then there is a pure longing. That
                                        pure longing is divine, that pure longing is God. Then there is pure creativity
                                        with no object, with no address, with no direction, with no destination &mdash;
                                        just pure energy, a pool of energy, going nowhere. That's what buddhahood is.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        <strong>Sex keeps you unconscious.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I don't call sex a sin, I simply call it stupid. I am not saying that you will suffer
                                        hell &mdash; what more hell do you need to suffer? You are already suffering in
                                        it. And what does it go on giving to you? It just keeps you engaged &mdash; engaged
                                        in the other so that you can avoid yourself. That is its basic stupidity: it keeps
                                        you ignorant because it keeps you ignoring yourself.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is as if you are standing on the road and I am sitting on the treetop. I say
                                        to you, "A bullock cart is coming down the road." You say, "I don't see any bullock
                                        cart. There is no bullock cart." But I can see; my perspective is greater because
                                        I am on a height. You will only see the bullock cart when it comes very close to
                                        you, and then after a few yards it will disappear again. And I will say to you,
                                        "It has not disappeared. It is still there on the road." You will say, "It is no
                                        longer there, it is gone."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The higher you rise, the more you can see. And when you reach the ultimate height,
                                        Buddhahood, you can see everything. Then there is no past and no future; then there
                                        is only present. And in that clarity, sex is the most stupid thing because it keeps
                                        you in bondage the longest.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I am not condemning it, I am simply stating a fact. It is your bondage. It keeps
                                        you unconscious. It does not allow you to see what you are doing. You are possessed
                                        by it. That's why I call it stupid: it keeps you unconscious, it keeps you in a
                                        kind of possession. It is hormonal, it is chemical. It is not you; it is just your
                                        biology that goes on forcing you to do certain things.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you watch, you will be surprised: What are you doing? And why are you doing?
                                        What are you gaining out of it? What have you gained up to now? And in your saner

                                        Passion creates many things in you. It creates fever, it makes you more unconscious
                                        &mdash; more unconscious than you already are. It drags you deeper into the mud.
                                        And with passion come hatred, illusion and desire &mdash; and then you are distracted
                                        from your nature. Your nature is poisoned, your innocence is poisoned. You lose
                                        all simplicity, all humbleness. Beware of the poisoning by passion. Be warm, be
                                        loving &mdash; that is a totally different phenomenon &mdash; but don't be full
                                        of lust. Warmth is possible with your consciousness.
                                    </p>

                                        A Buddha is very warm, a Jesus is very warm, very loving. Passion has disappeared.
                                        Passion has become transformed into compassion. Their compassion showers on you
                                        like flowers. Just as passion poisons you, compassion purifies you. Compassion is
                                        nectar if passion is poison.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The energy that is involved in passion can be released into compassion. Try, when
                                        you are angry, to be conscious, and you will be surprised &mdash; you are in for
                                        a great surprise. If you become conscious, anger disappears. And suddenly you have
                                        found a key, you have stumbled upon a secret. When sex dominates you and you are
                                        full of lust, close your eyes, sit silently and meditate on this energy that is
                                        surrounding you, this lust that is surrounding you like a cloud. Just watch it,
                                        see it. I am not saying be against it, because if you are against it you have already
                                        taken a standpoint.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now you cannot watch. For watching, the necessary step, the most necessary, is not
                                        to take any prejudice, not to conclude beforehand. Just remain silently watchful,
                                        neither for nor against. And within minutes you will be surprised that that great
                                        storm of lust is over. And when the storm is over, the silence that is left behind
                                        is so profound, is so great, such a blessing that you may not have felt it ever.

                                        No sexual experience can give you the beauty that will come if you watch your lust
                                        and through watchfulness the lust disappears. Then a silence comes to you which
                                        is virgin, which belongs to the beyond, which belongs to the other shore.

                                        Energies have to be transformed, not repressed. Energies are your potential wealth,
                                        raw; you have to polish them, then they can become great diamonds. These same energies,
                                        sexual energies, can become your spiritual liberation. Repressed you will be in
                                        a bondage.

                                        I am not saying to become indulgent; that is going to the other extreme. Buddha
                                        will also not support your indulgence. He is absolutely for the middle way, the
                                        golden mean. Neither be repressive nor be indulgent. Be watchful, be alert; be friendly
                                        to your energies, sympathetic. They are your energies; don't create a rift, otherwise
                                        you will always be in conflict, and to fight with your own energies is an unnecessary
                                        dissipation.

                                        Fighting with your own energies, you are fighting with yourself: you cannot win.
                                        You will be simply wasting the whole opportunity of life. Be aware, don't repress,
                                        don't indulge. Be aware, be natural. Let energies be accepted and absorbed, and
                                        then the same energies, crude energies, become so refined, passing through awareness,
                                        that great flowers bloom in your being &mdash; lotuses of enlightenment.

                                        Q: What is Happiness? Osho: It depends. It depends on you, on your state of consciousness
                                        or unconsciousness, whether you are asleep or awake. There is one famous maxim of
                                        Murphy. He says there are two types of people: One, who always divide humanity in
                                        two types, and the other, who don't divide humanity at all.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I belong to the first type ... Humanity can be divided in two types: the sleeping
                                        ones and the awakened ones &mdash; and, of course, a small part in between. Happiness
                                        will depend on where you are in your consciousness. If you are asleep, then pleasure
                                        is happiness. Pleasure means sensation, trying to achieve something through the
                                        body which is not possible to achieve through the body, forcing the body to achieve
                                        something it is not capable of.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        People are trying, in every possible way, to achieve happiness through the body.
                                        The body can give you only momentary pleasures, and each pleasure is balanced by
                                        pain in the same amount, in the same degree. Each pleasure is followed by its opposite
                                        because body exists in the world of duality, just as the day is followed by night
                                        and death is followed by life and life is followed by death.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is a vicious circle. Your pleasure will be followed by pain, your pain will be
                                        followed by pleasure. But you will never be at ease. When you will be in a state
                                        of pleasure you will be afraid that you are going to lose it, and that fear will
                                        poison it. And when you will be lost in pain, of course, you will be in suffering,
                                        and you will try every possible effort to get out of it &mdash; just to fall again
                                        back into it.
                                    </p>

                                        Buddha calls this the wheel of birth and death. We go on moving in this wheel, clinging
                                        to the wheel... and the wheel moves on. Sometimes pleasure comes up and sometimes
                                        pain comes up, but we are crushed between these two rocks. But the sleepy person
                                        knows nothing else. He knows only a few sensations of the body &mdash; food, sex.
                                        This is his world; he goes on moving between these two.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These are the two ends of his body: food and sex. If he represses sex he becomes
                                        addicted to food: if he represses food he becomes addicted to sex. Energy goes on
                                        moving like a pendulum. And whatsoever you call pleasure is, at the most, just a
                                        relief of a tense state. Sexual energy gathers, accumulates; you become tense and
                                        heavy and you want to release it. The man who is asleep, his sexuality is nothing
                                        but a relief, like a good sneeze. It gives you nothing but a certain relief. A tension
                                        was there, now it is no more there; but it will accumulate again. Food gives you
                                        only a little taste on the tongue; it is not much to live for. But many people are
                                        living only to eat; there are very few people who eat to live.
                                    </p>

                                        The story of Columbus is well-known. It was a long trip. For three months they saw
                                        nothing but water. Then one day Columbus looked out at the horizon and saw trees.
                                        And if you think Columbus was happy to see trees, you should have seen his dog!
                                        That's why the Siberian dogs are the fastest in the world: because the trees are
                                        so far apart.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But this is the world of pleasure. The dog can be forgiven, but you cannot be forgiven.
                                        It depends on people what can be called happiness. To the sleeping, pleasurable
                                        sensations are happiness. He lives from one pleasure to another pleasure. He is
                                        just rushing from one sensation to another sensation. He lives for small thrills.
                                        His life is very superficial; it has no depth, it has no quality. He lives in the
                                        world of quantity.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Then the people who are in between, who are neither asleep nor awake, who are just
                                        in a limbo, a little bit asleep, a little bit awake. You sometimes have that experience
                                        in the early morning: still sleepy, but you can't say you are asleep because you
                                        can hear the noise in the house, your wife preparing tea, the noise of the samovar
                                        or the milkman at the door or children getting ready to go to school. You can hear
                                        these things, but still you are not awake. Vaguely, dimly these noises reach to
                                        you, as if there is a great distance between you and all that is happening around
                                        you. It feels as if it is still a part of the dream. It is not a part of the dream,
                                        but you are in a state of in-between.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The same happens when you start meditating. The nonmeditator sleeps, dreams; the
                                        meditator starts moving away from his sleep towards awakening. He is in a transitory
                                        state. Then happiness has a totally different meaning: it becomes more of a quality,
                                        less of a quantity; it is more psychological, less physiological. He enjoys music
                                        more, he enjoys poetry more, he enjoys creating something. He enjoys nature, its
                                        beauty. He enjoys silence. He enjoys what he had never enjoyed before, and this
                                        is far more lasting. Even if the music stops, something goes on lingering in [him].

                                        The difference between pleasure and THIS happiness is: it is not a relief, it is
                                        an enrichment. You become more full, you become a little overflowing. Listening
                                        to good music, something is triggered in your being, a harmony arises in you &mdash;
                                        you become musical. Or dancing, suddenly you forget your body; your body becomes
                                        weightless. The grip of gravitation over you is lost. Suddenly you are in a different
                                        space: the ego is not so solid, the dancer melts and merges into the dance.

                                    <p>
                                        This is far higher, far deeper than the joy that you gain from food or sex. This
                                        has a depth. But this is also not the ultimate. The ultimate happens only when you
                                        are fully awake, when you are a buddha, when all sleep is gone and all dreaming
                                        is gone, when your whole being is full of light, when there is no darkness within
                                        you. All darkness has disappeared and with that darkness, the ego is gone. All tensions
                                        have disappeared, all anguish, all anxiety.

                                        You are in a state of total contentment. You live in the present; no past, no future
                                        anymore. You are utterly here-now. This moment is all. Now is the only time and
                                        here is the only space. And then suddenly the whole sky drops into you. This is
                                        bliss. This is REAL happiness.

                                        Seek bliss; it is your birthright. don't remain lost in the jungle of pleasures;
                                        rise a little higher. Reach to happiness and then to bliss. Pleasure is animal,
                                        happiness is human, bliss is divine. Pleasure binds you, it is a bondage, it chains
                                        you. Happiness gives you a little more rope, a little bit of freedom, but only a
                                        little bit.
                                    </p>

                                        Bliss is absolute freedom. You start moving upwards; it gives you wings. You are
                                        no more part of the gross earth; you become part of the sky. You become light, you
                                        become joy. Pleasure is dependent on others. Happiness is not so dependent on others,
                                        but still it is separate from you. Bliss is not dependent, is not separate either;
                                        it is your very being, it is your very nature. To attain it is to attain to God,
                                        to nirvana. <span class="note">[Osho Book "Dhammapada Vol 10."]</span>

                                        Love will happen to you, but sex will disappear; sexuality will disappear. Love,
                                        a very loving personality, will take its place. There will be no desire for sex.
                                        If the desire for sex remains, you have not experienced the inner light. Then the
                                        inner light is just a projection of the mind.

                                        What it can become does not depend on it alone, but on your understanding and on
                                        how you live your life. Have you not observed that it becomes brahmacharya, the
                                        state of celibacy when it is transformed? Bramhacharya is not hostile to passion;
                                        brahmacharya is the purification, the transcendence, the sublimation of passion.
                                        In the same way, the energy that manifests itself in violence becomes peace, serenity
                                        and tranquility. It is only a question of transformation.

                                        And so, when love reaches perfection, the absence of sex automatically follows.
                                        A life of love, an abstinence from physical pleasures is called brahmacharya, and
                                        anyone who wishes to be free from sex must develop his capacity to love. Freedom
                                        from sex cannot be achieved through supersession. Liberation from sex is only possible
                                        through love.

                                    <p>
                                        it is perfectly easy to go unconscious in sex, to completely forget what is going
                                        on, to get intoxicated is easy. To control sex, to force it to stop, to prevent
                                        yourself is also easy. But in both you miss. The one who indulges misses; the celibate
                                        misses too. The real brahmacharya happens when you stand in the middle between these
                                        two, then you are only watching.

                                        Then you will find that sex arises in the body and reverberates in the body; in
                                        the mind a shadow briefly falls and departs. You remain standing far away. How can
                                        sexual desire be in you? How can any desire be in you? You are nothing but the observer.

                                        Accept it. Do not create a division in your being, between parts of your being.
                                        Anger is there: accept it. Greed is there, or whatsoever: accept it. I do not mean
                                        be greedy. Rather on the contrary, the moment you accept you go beyond, because
                                        acceptance creates a unity, and when you are united within you have the energy to
                                        go beyond.

                                        It only functions momentarily; if you do not cooperate at the right moment, it stops.
                                        At the right moment your cooperation is needed, otherwise it cannot work. It is
                                        only a momentary mechanism, and if you do not cooperate with it, it will stop by
                                        itself.

                                        because that is its usual outlet, its usual center. So one must first be aware of
                                        one's downward "doors." Only awareness will close them; only non-cooperation will
                                        close them. Sex is not so forceful as we feel it to be. It is forceful only momentarily:
                                        it is not a twenty-four-hour affair, it is a momentary challenge.

                                        and celibacy happens on its own accord. Because to be in sex you have either to
                                        be identified with the male or identified with the female. A real celibate is one
                                        who has gone beyond, who is neither.

                                        The word Brahmacharya simply means living like a god, living with the experience
                                        of the Brahma, the absolute, living meditatively. If I am to translate Brahmacharya

                                        A celibacy without meditation is nothing but sexual repression. And your mind will
                                        become more and more sexual, so whenever you sit to meditate your mind will become
                                        full of fantasies, sexual fantasies.

                                        too &mdash; remember it. If you start claiming that you have become a celibate then
                                        sexuality still exists, and any day it can explode. You are sitting on a volcano.
                                        When sex has gone what is the meaning of celibacy? Then it is simply meaningless,
                                        the word is meaningless. 'Celibacy' can carry meaning only in reference to sex.
                                        Buddha says: When both dualities are gone you are simply in the middle &mdash; silent,
                                        calm, pure. The Way is attained. The Way is the middle Way.

                                <li>

                                        <strong>Celibacy should be brought very slowly.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        All that brings you again and again to sexuality has to be dropped slowly, in steps.
                                        And once you start enjoying the energy that becomes available, when you are not
                                        obsessed with sex, just that pure energy becomes a dance in you &mdash; that is
                                        called enriching. Then your energy is not wasted. Your energy goes on showering
                                        on yourself. Remember, there are two types of celibates: One, who has simply forced
                                        celibacy upon himself &mdash; he is a wrong type, he is doing violence to himself.
                                        The other, who has tried to understand sexuality, what it is, why it is; who has
                                        watched, observed, lived through it, and, by and by, has become aware of its futility;
                                        by and by, has become aware of a deep frustration that comes after each sexual act.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        <strong>Kabir says: Repression is not Brahmacharya.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Repressing your desires and destroying your desires is not the way of celibacy,
                                        because if you repress your desires you will remain hung-up with them. Whatsoever
                                        is repressed, you have to repress it again and again and again, and whatsoever is
                                        repressed, you have to sit on it continuously; otherwise there is fear &mdash; if
                                        you move somewhere else, it may bubble up again. Repression can never bring freedom.
                                        Repression makes you a slave. Repress anything, and that will become your master.
