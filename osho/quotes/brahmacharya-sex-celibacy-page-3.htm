                                        <strong>The sexual orgasm is very momentary, </strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        and whatsoever is momentary brings frustration in its wake, brings misery and unhappiness
                                        and sadness and repentance. But the quality of being orgasmic can become a continuity
                                        in you, a continuum &mdash; it can become your very flavor. But it is possible only
                                        through meditation, not through sex.

                                        <strong>Q: Why am I Tired of Sex? </strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Osho: Sex is tiring, and that's why I say to you: don't avoid it. Unless you know
                                        its stupidity you will not be able to get rid of it. Unless you know its sheer wastage,
                                        you will not be able to transcend it. It is good that you have started feeling tired
                                        &mdash; that is natural.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Sex simply means energy being dissipated downwards. The energy has to move upwards,
                                        then it is nourishing. Then it opens inexhaustible treasures in you &mdash; <i>aes dhammo
                                            sanantano.</i> <span class="note">[This is the ultimate law of life.]</span>
                                        But if you go on and on into sex like a maniac, soon you will find yourself utterly
                                        exhausted, wasted. What is the point of remaining in it if you are feeling tired?
                                        Get out of it!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And I am not saying repress it. When you are feeling much energy for it and you
                                        try to get out, there will be repression. But when you are exhausted and tired and
                                        you see the futility of it, you can come out of it without repression. And to come
                                        out of sex without repression is to be free of it. Freedom from sex is a great experience.
                                        Freedom from sex makes your energies available for meditation, for samadhi.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        <strong>Yes, it has to be transcended one day.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Because this is also a duality &mdash; man/woman &mdash; the same duality as between
                                        positive and negative, birth and death, summer and winter. It has to be transcended.
                                        One has to come to a point from where nothing disturbs your coolness, nothing distracts
                                        you from your center. But the way to come to it is not repression.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The first step is acceptance: it is natural. Accept it as part of your nature, as
                                        part of your biology. And then try to understand it, watch it, observe it, witness
                                        it. Slowly slowly, as your witnessing will grow, you will go beyond it. One day
                                        you will not find any difference between a man and a woman: you have gone beyond
                                        sexuality. That is true Brahmacharya, true celibacy, but it is not what has been
                                        told to you.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>When one becomes pure</strong> &mdash;
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        through nonviolence, nonpossessiveness, authenticity &mdash; when one becomes more
                                        and more pure, <strong>the focus of consciousness shifts from the body to the being.</strong>
                                        The being can remain absolutely alone.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The body needs togetherness; and your innermost soul needs aloneness. That is the
                                        problem. Your innermost soul can remain alone: it is a Himalayan peak standing alone
                                        against the sky. Your innermost soul grows when it is alone, but your body needs
                                        relatedness.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The body needs crowds, warmth, clubs, societies, organizations. Whenever you are
                                        with many people the body feels good. In a crowd your soul may feel starved because
                                        it feeds on aloneness, but your body feels good. In aloneness your soul feels perfect,
                                        but the body starts feeling hungry for relationship. But when somebody has attained
                                        to aloneness and the focus of consciousness has changed &mdash; that's what yoga
                                        is all about: how to change the focus from the body to the soul, from matter to
                                        nonmatter, from the visible to the invisible, from the known to the unknown, from
                                        the world to God.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        However you phrase it is immaterial. It is a change of focus. When the focus has
                                        completely changed, the yogi is so happy in his aloneness, so blissful, that that
                                        ordinary hankering of the body to be with others by and by disappears. When the
                                        purity is attained there arises in the yogi a disillusionment for his own body:
                                        now he knows that the paradise that he has been seeking cannot be attained through
                                        the body, the bliss that he has been dreaming about is not possible through the
                                        body.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is impossible for the body: through the limited you are trying to reach the unlimited.
                                        Through matter you are trying to reach the eternal, the immortal. Nothing is wrong
                                        in the body: your effort is absurd. don't be angry with the body; the body has not
                                        done anything to you. It is just as if someone is trying to listen through the eyes
                                        &mdash; now nothing is wrong with the eyes: eyes are made to see, not to listen.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The body is made of matter; it is not made of the immaterial. It is made of death.
                                        It cannot be immortal. You are asking the impossible. don't ask that. That is the
                                        point of disillusionment: the yogi simply understands what is possible and what
                                        is not possible with the body. That which is possible is okay; that which is not
                                        possible he does not ask. He is not angry. He doesn't hate the body. He takes every
                                        care of it because the body can become a ladder; it can become a door, It cannot
                                        become the goal, but it can become the door.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A disillusionment for his own body &mdash; and when this disillusionment happens:
                                        "a disinclination to come in physical contact with others." Then the need to be
                                        in physical contact with others, by and by, withers away. In fact this is the right
                                        moment when you can say the man has come out of the womb, not before it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In a yogi this urge to be in relationships disappears &mdash; and with this urge,
                                        he is really born. We in India have called him "twice-born," dwij. This is his second
                                        birth, the real birth. Now he is no longer in need of anybody; he has become a transcendental
                                        light. Now he can float above the earth; now he can fly in the sky. He is not earth-rooted
                                        now. He has become a flower &mdash; not a flower, because even a flower is earth-rooted
                                        &mdash; he has become the fragrance of the flower. Completely free. Moves into the
                                        sky with no roots in the earth. His desire to come in contact with others' bodies
                                        disappears.

                                        Freedom from the body, freedom from that continuous obsession. When sex really disappears,
                                        without any repression, when it disappears through meditation, for the first time
                                        it gives you the taste of total freedom. You don't need anybody any more; you are
                                        out of the grip of biology. In fact when sex has disappeared you become a man for
                                        the first time, because with sex you remain part of the animal world.

                                        <strong>The increase in sexual power and the opening of the kundalini passage are simultaneous
                                        </strong>&mdash;

                                        Not the same, but simultaneous. The increase in sexual power will be the thrust
                                        to open up the higher centers; so sexual power will increase. If you can be aware
                                        of it and not use it sexually &mdash; if you do not allow it to be released sexually
                                        &mdash; it will become so intense that the upward movement will begin.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        First the energy will try its best to be released sexually, because that is its
                                        usual outlet, its usual center. So one must first be aware of one's downward "doors."
                                        Only awareness will close them; only noncooperation will close them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Sex is not so forceful as we feel it to be. It is forceful only momentarily: it
                                        is not a twenty-four-hour affair, it is a momentary challenge. If you can be noncooperative
                                        and aware, it goes. And you will feel more happiness than when sexual energy is
                                        released from the downward passage.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Conservation of energy is always blissful: wastage of energy is only a relief, it
                                        is not blissful. You have unburdened yourself; you have alleviated something that
                                        was troubling you. Now you have become unburdened, but you have also become emptied.
                                        The feeling of emptiness that is overtaking the whole Western mind is just because
                                        of sexual wastage. Life seems to be empty. Life is never empty, but it seems to
                                        be empty because you have been simply unburdening yourself, just relieving yourself.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If something is conserved it becomes a richness: if your upward door is open and
                                        energy goes upward, not only do you feel relieved, not only is the straining point
                                        relieved, but it is not vacant. In a way it is fulfilled; it is overflowing. The
                                        energy has gone upward, but the basic center has not become empty. It is overflowing,
                                        and the overflowing energy goes upward, up toward the brahma randhra. <sup>[1]</sup></p>
                                    <p class="fnote">

                                        Then, near the brahma randhra, there is neither an upward movement nor a downward
                                        movement. Now the energy goes to the cosmic: it goes to the all; it goes to the
                                        brahman &mdash; the ultimate reality. That is why the seventh chakra is known as
                                        the brahma randhra &mdash; the door to the brahman, the door to the divine. Then
                                        there is no "up" and no "down." It will feel like something is penetrating, thrusting
                                        upward &mdash; and a moment will come when one will feel as though that something
                                        is no longer there, that it has gone. Now it is overflowing into the passage.
                                    </p>

                                        The petals of the sahasrar are just a symbol for the feelings that occur when energy
                                        overflows. The overflowing is a flowering, just like a flower itself is an overflowing.
                                        You will feel that something has become a flower; the door is open, and it will
                                        go outward. It will not be felt inwardly; it will be felt outwardly. Something has
                                        opened like a flower, like a flower with a thousand petals.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is just a feeling, but the feeling corresponds to the truth. The feeling is a
                                        translation and interpretation. The mind cannot conceive of it, but the feeling
                                        is just like a flowering. The closest, the nearest thing that we can say is that
                                        it is like a bud opening. It is felt like that. That is why we have conceived of
                                        the opening of the sahasrar as a thousand-petaled lotus. So many petals &mdash;
                                        so many! And they go on opening, they go on opening... the opening is endless.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is a fulfillment; it is a flowering of the human being. Then you become just
                                        like a tree, and everything that was in you has flowered. Then all you can do is
                                        to offer this flower to the divine. We have been offering flowers, but they are
                                        broken flowers. Only this flower can be a real offering.

                                        <strong>Energy has been going downward through the sex center continuously for many
                                            births, </strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        so when any energy is created it will first try to move downward. That is why meditation
                                        sometimes will create more sexuality in you than you have ever felt before. You
                                        will feel more sexual because you have generated more energy than you previously
                                        had.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When you have conserved something, the old, habitual passage is ready to release
                                        it. The mechanism is ready, the old passage is ready. Your mind only knows one passage
                                        &mdash; the lower one, the sexual passage &mdash; so when you are meditating the
                                        first movement of your life energy will be downward. Just be aware of it. Do not
                                        struggle with it; just be aware of it. Be aware of the habitual passage, be aware
                                        of sexual images; let them come. Be aware of them, but do not do anything about
                                        the situation; just be aware of it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The sexual passage cannot operate without your cooperation, but if you cooperate
                                        with it even for a single moment, it can start functioning. So do not cooperate
                                        with it: just be aware of it. The mechanism of sex is so much a momentary phenomenon
                                        that it only functions momentarily; if you do not cooperate at the right moment,
                                        it stops. At the right moment your cooperation is needed, otherwise it cannot work.
                                        It is only a momentary mechanism, and if you do not cooperate with it, it will stop
                                        by itself.

                                        Time and time again, energy is created through meditation. It continues to move
                                        downward, but now you are aware of it. The old passage is cut &mdash; not suppressed.
                                        Energy is there and it needs to be released, but the lower door is closed: not suppressed
                                        &mdash; closed. You have not cooperated with it, that's all. You have not positively
                                        suppressed it, you have only negatively not cooperated with it.

                                        You have just been aware of what is happening to your mind, to your body. You are
                                        just aware; then energy is conserved. Then the quantity of the energy becomes more
                                        and more intense and an upward thrust becomes necessary. Now the energy will go
                                        upward; by its very force, a new passage will be thrown open.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When energy goes upward you will be more sexually attractive to others, because
                                        life energy going upward creates a great magnetic force. You will become more sexually
                                        attractive to others, so you will have to be aware of this. Now you will attract
                                        persons unknowingly, and the attraction will not only be physical; the attraction
                                        will be etheric.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even a repulsive body, a nonattractive body, will become attractive with yoga. The
                                        attraction is etheric; and it is so magnetic that one has to be constantly aware
                                        of it, constantly aware. You will be attractive and the opposite sex will be irresistably
                                        drawn to you.
                                    </p>

                                        There are subtle vibrations that are created by your etheric body: you have to be
                                        aware of them. The type of attraction that will be felt by the opposite sex will
                                        differ &mdash; it will take so many different forms &mdash; but basically it will
                                        be sexual. At its root, it will be sexual. But you can help these people. Even if
                                        they are attracted to you sexually, they have become attracted to a sexual energy
                                        that is moving upward. And they too are not ordinary sexual beings: upwardmoving
                                        sexual energy has become an attraction, a magnet. So you can help them; if you do
                                        not become involved, then you can help them.

                                        A moment comes when you are reaching the climax, a moment comes just before ejaculation
                                        or orgasm when mind stops. You become pure energy, bioenergy, just a stream of energy,
                                        no-mind. No-mind is meditation. <strong>But if you become stuck just in sexual meditation
                                            you will not grow.</strong>

                                        Nothing is wrong in it, but you have to grow beyond it because this sexual meditation
                                        depends on the other, and anything that depends on the other cannot make you ultimately
                                        free; you will remain dependent. Right meditation means a moment where mind ceases,
                                        you have become one energy &mdash; but not moving towards the other, not moving
                                        in any direction, but simply remaining in yourself. That will become samadhi. Meditation
                                        moving towards the other becomes a sexual act; meditation moving nowhere, remaining
                                        inside, becomes samadhi.

                                        rule of success is not known yet. As long as we are unable to ascertain the right
                                        alliance between the respective energy bodies of two persons, marriages are bound
                                        to remain a failure no matter what steps we take in other directions. Successful
                                        marriages can only be possible if absolutely clear scientific details concerning
                                        these various inner bodies are achieved.

                                        A boy or a girl who has reached up to the point of the awakening of the kundalini
                                        finds it very easy to choose the right partner in life. With the full knowledge
                                        of all his bodies within, one can make the right choice outwardly. Prior to this
                                        it is very difficult. Therefore, those who knew insisted that the child should be
                                        made to develop his first four bodies in the first twenty-five years by maintaining
                                        brahmacharya, and then only could he marry. Because whom should he marry? With whom
                                        does he want to spend the rest of his life? Whom is he seeking?

                                        What man does a woman seek? She seeks the man within her. If by coincidence the
                                        right connections are made, then both the man and woman are satisfied; otherwise,
                                        dissatisfaction remains and a thousand perversions result from this. The man then
                                        goes to a prostitute or seeks the woman next door. His distress grows day by day,
                                        and this misery is bound to increase with the growth of man's intellect.

                                        When you are totally aware, sex becomes vertical. And that vertical movement of
                                        sex is kundalini. If sex moves horizontally, then you go on reproducing others and
                                        reproducing yourself. If the energy begins to move upward, vertically, you just
                                        go out &mdash; out of the wheel of Existence, as the Buddhists say, out of the wheel
                                        of life. This is a new birth &mdash; not in a new body, but in a new dimension of
                                        existence. This Buddhists have called Nirvana. You can call it Moksha &mdash; liberation

                                        Rather, on the contrary, something new has come to his life. It is not that he has
                                        no sex hormones. They are there. So what has happened to him? His consciousness
                                        has deepened, and his consciousness has entered even into the sex cells. Then the
                                        sex cells are there, but they cannot behave independently. Unless the center orders
                                        them to act, they cannot act. They will remain inactive. In an impotent person sex
                                        cells are not. In a Buddha they are there and more strong than in an ordinary person
                                        &mdash; stronger, because never used. Energy is accumulated in them, they are bubbling
                                        with energy, but consciousness has penetrated into the cells now. Now the consciousness
                                        is not only a starting point, it has become the master.

                                        is for the survival of your race. It is a distant phenomenon, not related with you.
                                        Sex is food for the race, not for you. You will die, but through sex humanity can
                                        live. So it is not really your problem; it is a racial problem. You can even leave
                                        it, but you cannot leave food because that is your problem. It is concerned with
                                        you. So if you go on a fast, by and by sex will disappear; it will become more and
                                        more distant.

                                        Now if you fight it, you will have double anger &mdash; anger plus this angriness
                                        against anger &mdash; and you will be divided. You can go on fighting, but this
                                        fight is just absurd. It is as if I am trying to fight my right hand with my left
                                        hand. I can go on fighting. Sometimes my right hand will win, sometimes my left
                                        hand will win, but there is no victory. You can play with the game, but there is
                                        neither defeat nor victory.

                                        Awareness is not a method for transcendence. <i>Awareness IS transcendence.</i>
                                        This constant awareness of your mind dissolves your greed, your anger, your sex,
                                        your hate, your jealousy, by and by. They dissolve automatically. There is no effort
                                        to dissolve them, not even any intention to dissolve them, not any longing to dissolve
                                        them. They are there, so rather than an intention to dissolve them, acceptance is
                                        more helpful.

                                        <strong>Think of sex, and mind is absorbed.</strong>
                                    </p>

                                        No need to concentrate &mdash; it concentrates. No need to make any effort &mdash;
                                        mind flows easily. Really, we don't know anything else except sex by which we can
                                        understand what concentration means. So it happens always that whenever a person
                                        can concentrate on any other thing, sex will not be a problem for him &mdash; whenever!
                                        Even if he is just a scientist, a research-worker, working in his lab, if he can
                                        concentrate on his work then sex will not be a problem in his life at all.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But if you cannot concentrate on anything else, then your mind will be flowing through
                                        the channel of sex constantly. One thing must be understood: when you are thinking
                                        about sex, you are totally absorbed. There is no wavering. You even forget that
                                        you are thinking about sex &mdash; you may remember afterwards. Even this much wavering
                                        is not there. You forget that you are different and that this procession of sexual
                                        thoughts and images is different. You become one with them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This is what is meant when bhaktas say, "The constant remembering of the Divine
                                        &mdash; without you, without 'I'."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The same phenomenon occurs, only the object changes. It is not sex now; the object
                                        becomes Divine. And unless the Divine becomes as absorbing as sex is naturally,
                                        you cannot flow upward. So the upward flow is an effort: you have to pull yourself
                                        together for it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The downward flow is easy. That's why, whenever you feel tense, sex becomes a relaxation,
                                        a relief &mdash; because every tension means that you have been pulling yourself
                                        together towards something which is not natural. Then if you can relax to the downward
                                        flow, you will feel a relief. So in the West particularly, sex has become just a
                                        relief &mdash; just a relief from tensions. It is, and it is because when you flow
                                        downward no effort is needed. So sex is used by many, really by ninety-nine percent
                                        of people, as a tranquillizer.

                                    <p>
                                        If you move in sex then you can sleep well. Why? Because when the mind is flowing
                                        downward your whole body is relaxed. Unless you are relaxed in the same way when
                                        your mind is going upward, you are not a religious person at all.
