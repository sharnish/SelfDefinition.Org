                                        <strong>Love has its own meditation. But you do not know love,</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        you know only sex and you know the misery of wasting energy. Then you get depressed
                                        after it. Then you decide to take a vow of Brahmacharya, celibacy. And this vow
                                        is taken in depression, this vow is taken in anger, this vow is taken in frustration.
                                        It is not going to help. A vow can be helpful if taken in a very relaxed, deeply
                                        meditative mood. Otherwise you are simply showing your anger, your frustration and
                                        nothing else, and you will forget the vow within twenty-four hours. The energy will
                                        have come again, and just as an old routine you will have to release it.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        <strong>Brahmacharya cannot be taught.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Only meditation can be taught. Brahmacharya is the result. As meditation ripens,
                                        brahmacharya comes to fruit by itself. All effort is to be put into meditation.
                                        One who puts his effort directly into brahmacharya will sit suppressing sex in the
                                        name of brahmacharya. And brahmacharya is not happening &mdash; it is only superficial
                                        &mdash; within the being the worms of desire are crawling.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        <strong>Lust means how to use something for your happiness.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Love means your happiness is not at all concerned. Really, lust means how to get
                                        something out of it and love means how to give something. They are diametrically
                                        opposite. If you see a beautiful face and you feel love toward the face, the immediate
                                        feeling in your consciousness will be how to do something to make this face happy,
                                        how to do something to make this man or this woman happy. The concern is not with
                                        yourself, the concern is with the other.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In love the other is important; in lust you are important. In lust you are thinking
                                        how to make the other your instrument; in love you are thinking how to become an
                                        instrument yourself. In lust you are going to sacrifice the other; in love you are
                                        going to sacrifice yourself. Love means giving; lust means getting. Love is a surrender;
                                        lust is an aggression.
                                    </p>

                                        <strong>I am not against sex, but I am against sexuality.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And let me make a distinction: when you're feeling very sexual and being possessed
                                        by the person, this is not the moment to do anything. Close your doors, meditate
                                        on your sexuality. Let it arise, let it come out of the dark night within you. Out
                                        of the jungle, let it spread &mdash; you watch, you simply watch, you become an
                                        unmoving flame of awareness. Soon you will see it has settled again, and your consciousness
                                        is burning brighter than ever. You have absorbed it; it has become nectar.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        <strong>To me, if sex is the creative force in the world, it must be nearest to the
                                            creative center of the world</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        &mdash; whatever name you give to it. Creative energy must be closest to creation,
                                        to the creative source of it all. People should be taught the art of converting
                                        sexual energy into spiritual enlightenment.
                                    </p>

                                        <strong>In the sexual act you have a certain thrill, a moment of forgetfulness, a moment
                                            of oblivion.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You feel good &mdash; for a few seconds, only for a few seconds, you drop out of
                                        this routine world. Sex gives you a door to escape into some other world &mdash;
                                        which is non-tense; there is no worry; you are simply relaxed and melting. But have
                                        you observed? After each sexual act you feel frustrated. Sex creates neurosis, it
                                        is neurotic, because it can never satisfy you.
                                    </p>

                                        Now, go to the madhouses of the world and just watch the mad people, and you will
                                        always find that somewhere or other there is a sexual problem. That's what Freud
                                        says, that all pathology is somehow connected with sex. Too much sex obsession becomes
                                        neurotic. If you live in the body, you are bound to become neurotic. You have to
                                        go a little deeper and higher than the body.

                                        upright. With love you stand erect on earth. With sex you are again animal, you
                                        are horizontal on the earth, just moving like other animals, crawling. With love

                                        mysteries of existence. In fact, now begins the real life; up to now you were a
                                        slave. Now, boundaries are dropping and the whole sky is becoming available to you

                                        If you can become wise while you are young, just thirty, thank God. Be grateful
                                        to existence that he is allowing you so much time to explore much that is not available
                                        to any other animal, and only available to man. And the more time you have to explore
                                        it, the deeper will be your insight, the greater will be your consciousness and
                                        tremendous will be your splendor. You will not die an ugly death; you will die with

                                        Nityanando, you are fortunate that life need not be empty for you. If sex is going,
                                        say goodbye to it. It was good when it was there; it is better when it is gone.
                                        Now begins a totally different space of experiencing. Now begins a new adventure,
                                        more free, more individual, more unfettered.

                                        The sky is so vast to explore... and on each step there are miracles and miracles.
                                        So sing and dance and meditate. And life is immensely beautiful: it has all that
                                        Gautam Buddha experienced and more, because twenty-five centuries have passed; man
                                        has become far more mature, and evolution has gone higher. We can produce greater
                                        Gautam Buddhas with more dimensions to them.

                                        <strong>If you become meditative, you will come to realize a new fact. </strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        That fact is that it is not sex that gives you bliss, it is not sex that gives you
                                        the ecstasy. Rather, it is a thoughtless state of the mind and total involvement
                                        in the act that gives you a blissful feeling. Once you understand this then sex
                                        will be needed less and less, because that thoughtless state of mind can be created
                                        without it &mdash; that's what meditation means.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And that totality of being can be created without sex. Once you know that the same
                                        phenomenon can happen without sex, sex will be needed less and less. A moment will
                                        come when sex will not be needed at all. Remember, sex is always dependent on the
                                        other. So in sex, a bondage, a slavery remains. Once you can create this total orgasmic
                                        phenomenon without any dependence on anybody else, when it has become an inner source,
                                        you are independent, you are free.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        That's what is meant when, in India, we say only a brahmachari, an absolutely celibate
                                        person, can be free &mdash; because now he is not dependent on anybody else, his
                                        ecstasy is his own. Sex disappears through meditation, but this is not destroying
                                        the energy. Energy is never destroyed; only the form of the energy changes. Then
                                        it is no longer sexual, and when the form is no longer sexual, then you become loving.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So, really, a person who is sexual cannot love. His love can only be a show. His
                                        love is just a means towards sex. A person who is sexual uses love just as a technique
                                        towards sex. It is a means. A sexual person cannot really love, he can only exploit
                                        the other; and love becomes just a way to approach the other.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A person who has become non-sexual, and the energy is moving within, has become
                                        auto-ecstatic. His ecstasy is his own. Such a person will be loving for the first
                                        time. His love will be a constant showering, a constant sharing, a constant giving.

                                        But it is not; it is only a very small part. It has something tremendously important
                                        to contribute but it is not all the story. It is just the beginning. It will be
                                        even more correct to say it is just the preface, not even the beginning.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But my feeling about you is that you are ready to go into some new space &mdash;
                                        higher, better, superior, more graceful. And when this conflict with sex disappears
                                        and you accept the stage you are in, much love will arise in you. And it will not
                                        be sexual love &mdash; it will have a different quality: it will be more like friendship,
                                        more like prayer, more like creating music, singing a song, looking at the sunset.
                                        It will have all those qualities. It will be more aesthetic, less sexual.

                                    <p>
                                        The sexual love remains a little coloured with violence; it remains a little crude.
                                        It can't be very soft; it can't have grace and dignity. It is anger; it is our animal
                                        heritage.

                                        Drop this machismo, and forget all about it. And there is no problem; you are creating
                                        it. Put more and more of your effort into meditation. You will be surprised: the
                                        energy that goes into sex will start going into meditation, and sooner or later
                                        you will be having the same kind of orgasmic experiences through meditation as people
                                        have through sex.

                                        The sexual orgasm is bound to take too much energy out of you. It is a sheer wastage.
                                        It gives very little and takes very much. In the meditative orgasm, with no energy
                                        investment from your side the same quality &mdash; deeper, higher, profounder &mdash;
                                        happens. Later on you will find yourself more energetic than before. The meditative
                                        orgasm will leave you with more energy, with more vibrant energy than before. And
                                        this is possible.

                                        back to me, and the energy that was used in producing it, that was used in throwing
                                        it away, is dissipated. But when a word arises in me and I don't throw it out: I
                                        remain silent. Then the word moves and moves and moves, and falls into the original
                                        source again. The energy has been reconsumed.

                                        Silence is energy. Brahmacharya is energy. Not to be angry is energy. But this is
                                        not suppression. If you suppress anger, you have used energy again. don't suppress
                                        &mdash; observe and follow. don't fight &mdash; just move backwards with the anger.

                                        It is a very silent breeze. Sex is passion, violence, aggression, with force, with
                                        strong energy &mdash; it attacks. The heart and the sex center can join together,
                                        then love becomes passionate. If heart is not joined with the sex center then love
                                        becomes compassionate. Then love is there in its total purity and only then, when
                                        there is no passion in it, is love pure. It is silent, passive, nonaggressive.

                                        been struggling hard to release yourself from its clutches, then it is going to
                                        be so.

                                        <strong>If this house is suddenly on fire, you will be more aware.</strong>

                                        You know that your awareness goes up and down. At certain moments you are more aware;
                                        at certain moments, less aware. So it is possible to create the situation of being
                                        more aware. That's why awareness became the basis of meditation. And with awareness
                                        came the surprise that as you become aware, thoughts disappear. When you are fully
                                        aware, there are no thoughts, and suddenly time has stopped. Time can be there inside
                                        only with the movement of thoughts.

                                        This is one of the most fundamental keys for all the diseases of the human mind.
                                        If you can become a witness, the opposites fight against each other, with each other,
                                        and both are dead, both disappear. But if you choose one thing over the other, you
                                        cannot be a witness.

                                        Sex is not beyond money &mdash; love is. Transform your sex into love, and transform
                                        your love into prayer &mdash; so one day even kings like Bimbisara may feel jealous
                                        of you. Become a Mahavira, a Buddha, become a Christ, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu.
                                        Only then have you lived, only then have you known the mysteries of life!

                                        they are living. They are not living, they are only vegetating, they are only dying.
                                        This is not life. Life has many more kingdoms to be revealed, an infinite treasure
                                        which is not of this world. Neither sex can give it to you, nor money.
