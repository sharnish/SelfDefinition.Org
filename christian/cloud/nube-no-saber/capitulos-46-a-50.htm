								Six and Fortieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>A good teaching how a man shall flee these deceits, and work more with a listiness
									of spirit, than with any boisterousness of body.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND therefore for God's love be wary in this work, and strain not thine heart in
								thy breast over-rudely nor out of measure; but work more with a list than with any
								worthless strength. For ever the more Mistily, the more meekly and ghostly: and
								ever the more rudely, the more bodily and beastly. And therefore be wary, for surely
								what beastly heart that presumeth for to touch the high mount of this work, it shall
								be beaten away with stones. Stones be hard and dry in their kind, and they hurt
								full sore where they hit. And surely such rude strainings be full hard fastened
								in fleshliness of bodily feeling, and full dry from any witting of grace; and they
								hurt full sore the silly soul, and make it fester in fantasy feigned of fiends.
								And therefore be wary with this beastly rudeness, and learn thee to love listily,
								with a soft and a demure behaviour as well in body as in soul; and abide courteously
								and meekly the will of our Lord, and snatch not overhastily, as it were a greedy
								greyhound, hunger thee never so sore. And, gamingly be it said, I counsel that thou
								do that in thee is, refraining the rude and the great stirring of thy spirit, right
								as thou on nowise wouldest let Him wit how fain thou wouldest see Him, and have
								Him or feel Him.</p>
							<p>
								This is childishly and playingly spoken, thee think peradventure. But I trow whoso
								had grace to do and feel as I say, he should feel good gamesome play with Him, as
								the father doth with the child, kissing and clipping, that well were him so.</p>

							<h4>
								Seven and Fortieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>A slight teaching of this work in purity of spirit; declaring how that on one manner
									a soul should shew his desire unto God, and on ye contrary unto man.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								LOOK thou have no wonder why that I speak thus childishly, and as it were follily
								and lacking natural discretion; for I do it for certain reasons, and as me thinketh
								that I have been stirred many days, both to feel thus and think thus and say thus,
								as well to some other of my special friends in God, as I am now unto thee.</p>
							<p>
								And one reason is this, why that I bid thee hide from God the desire of thine heart.
								For I hope it should more clearly come to His knowing, for thy profit and in fulfilling
								of thy desire, by such an hiding, than it should by any other manner of shewing
								that I trow thou couldest yet shew. And another reason is, for I would by such a
								hid shewing bring thee out of the boisterousness of bodily feeling into the purity
								and deepness of ghostly feeling; and so furthermore at the last to help thee to
								knit the ghostly knot of burning love betwixt thee and thy God, in ghostly onehead
								and according of will.</p>
							<p>
								Thou wottest well this, that God is a Spirit; and whoso should be oned unto Him,
								it behoveth to be in soothfastness and deepness of spirit, full far from any feigned
								bodily thing. Sooth it is that all thing is known of God, and nothing may be hid
								from His witting, neither bodily thing nor ghostly. But more openly is that thing
								known and shewed unto Him, the which is hid in deepness of spirit, sith it so is
								that He is a Spirit, than is anything that is mingled with any manner of bodilyness.
								For all bodily thing is farther from God by the course of nature than any ghostly
								thing. By this reason it seemeth, that the whiles our desire is mingled with any
								matter of bodilyness, as it is when we stress and strain us in spirit and in body
								together, so long it is farther from God than it should be, an it were done more
								devoutly and more listily in soberness and in purity and in deepness of spirit.</p>
							<p>
								And here mayest thou see somewhat and in part the reason why that I bid thee so
								childishly cover and hide the stirring of thy desire from God. And yet I bid thee
								not plainly hide it; for that were the bidding of a fool, for to bid thee plainly
								do that which on nowise may be done. But I bid thee do that in thee is to hide it.
								And why bid I thus? Surely because I would that thou cast it into deepness of spirit,
								far from any rude mingling of any bodilyness, the which would make it less ghostly
								and farther from God inasmuch: and because I wot well that ever the more that thy
								spirit hath of ghostliness, the less it hath of bodilyness and the nearer it is
								to God, and the better it pleaseth Him and the more clearly it may be seen of Him.
								Not that His sight may be any time or in any thing more clear than in another, for
								it is evermore unchangeable: but because it is more like unto Him, when it is in
								purity of spirit, for He is a Spirit.</p>
							<p>
								Another reason there is, why that I bid thee do that in thee is to let Him not wit:
								for thou and I and many such as we be, we be so able to conceive a thing bodily
								the which is said ghostly, that peradventure an I had bidden thee shew unto God
								the stirring of thine heart, thou shouldest have made a bodily shewing unto Him,
								either in gesture or in voice, or in word, or in some other rude bodily straining,
								as it is when thou shalt shew a thing that is hid in thine heart to a bodily man:
								and insomuch thy work should have been impure. For on one manner shall a thing be
								shewed to man, and on another manner unto God.</p>

							<h4>
								Eight and Fortieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>How God will be served both with body and with soul, and reward men in both; and
									how men shall know when all those sounds and sweetness that fall into the body in
									time of prayer be both good and evil.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								I SAY not this because I will that thou desist any time, if thou be stirred for
								to pray with thy mouth, or for to burst out for abundance of devotion in thy spirit
								for to speak unto God as unto man, and say some good word as thou feelest thee stirred:
								as be these, &quot;Good JESU! Fair JESU! Sweet JESU!&quot; and all such other. Nay,
								God forbid thou take it thus! For truly I mean not thus, and God forbid that I should
								depart that which God hath coupled, the body and the spirit. For God will be served
								with body and with soul both together, as seemly is, and will reward man his meed
								in bliss, both in body and in soul. And in earnest of that meed, sometimes He will
								enflame the body of devout servants of His here in this life: not once or twice,
								but peradventure right oft and as Him liketh, with full wonderful sweetness and
								comforts. Of the which, some be not coming from without into the body by the windows
								of our wits, but from within; rising and springing of abundance of ghostly gladness,
								and of true devotion in the spirit. Such a comfort and such a sweetness shall not
								be had suspect: and shortly to say, I trow that he that feeleth it may not have
								it suspect.</p>
							<p>
								But all other comforts, sounds and gladness and sweetness, that come from without
								suddenly and thou wottest never whence, I pray thee have them suspect. For they
								may be both good and evil; wrought by a good angel if they be good, and by an evil
								angel if they be evil. And this may on nowise be evil, if their deceits of curiosity
								of wit, and of unordained straining of the fleshly heart be removed as I learn thee,
								or better if thou better mayest. And why is that? Surely for the cause of this comfort;
								that is to say, the devout stirring of love, the which dwelleth in pure spirit.
								It is wrought of the hand of Almighty God without means, and therefore it behoveth
								always be far from any fantasy, or any false opinion that may befall to man in this
								life.</p>
							<p>
								And of the tother comforts and sounds and sweetness, how thou shouldest wit whether
								they be good or evil I think not to tell thee at this time: and that is because
								me think that it needeth not. For why, thou mayest find it written in another place
								of another man's work, a thousandfold better than I can say or write: and so mayest
								thou this that I set here, far better than it is here. But what thereof? Therefore
								shall I not let, nor it shall not noye me, to fulfil the desire and the stirring
								of thine heart; the which thou hast shewed thee to have unto me before this time
								in thy words, and now in thy deeds.</p>
							<p>
								But this may I say thee of those sounds and of those sweetnesses, that come in by
								the windows of thy wits, the which may be both good and evil. Use thee continually
								in this blind and devout and this Misty stirring of love that I tell thee: and then
								I have no doubt, that it shall not well be able to tell thee of them. And if thou
								yet be in part astonished of them at the first time, and that is because that they
								be uncouth, yet this shall it do thee: it shall bind thine heart so fast, that thou
								shalt on nowise give full great credence to them, ere the time be that thou be either
								certified of them within wonderfully by the Spirit of God, or else without by counsel
								of some discreet father.</p>

							<h4>
								Nine and Fortieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>The substance of all perfection is nought else but a good will; and how that all
									sounds and comfort and sweetness that may befall in this life be to it but as it
									were accidents.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND therefore I pray thee, lean listily to this meek stirring of love in thine heart,
								and follow thereafter: for it will be thy guide in this life and bring thee to bliss
								in the tother. It is the substance of all good living, and without it no good work
								may be begun nor ended. It is nought else but a good and an according will unto
								God, and a manner of well-pleasedness and a gladness that thou feelest in thy will
								of all that He doth.</p>
							<p>
								Such a good will is the substance of all perfection. All sweetness and comforts,
								bodily or ghostly, be to this but as it were accidents, be they never so holy; and
								they do but hang on this good will. Accidents I call them, for they may be had and
								lacked without breaking asunder of it. I mean in this life, but it is not so in
								the bliss of heaven; for there shall they be oned with the substance without departing,
								as shall the body in the which they work with the soul. So that the substance of
								them here is but a good ghostly will. And surely I trow that he that feeleth the
								perfection of this will, as it may be had here, there may no sweetness nor no comfort
								fall to any man in this life, that he is not as fain and as glad to lack it at God's
								will, as to feel it and have it.</p>

								Fiftieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>Which is chaste love; and how in some creatures such sensible comforts be but seldom,
									and in some right oft.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND hereby mayest thou see that we should direct all our beholding unto this meek
								stirring of love in our will. And in all other sweetness and comforts, bodily or
								ghostly, be they never so liking nor so holy, if it be courteous and seemly to say,
								we should have a manner of recklessness. If they come, welcome them: but lean not
								too much on them for fear of feebleness, for it will take full much of thy powers
								to bide any long time in such sweet feelings and weepings. And peradventure thou
								mayest be stirred for to love God for them, and that shalt thou feel by this: if
								thou grumble overmuch when they be away. And if it be thus, thy love is not yet
								neither chaste nor perfect. For a love that is chaste and perfect, though it suffer
								that the body be fed and comforted in the presence of such sweet feelings and weepings,
								nevertheless yet it is not grumbling, but full well pleased for to lack them at
								God's will. And yet it is not commonly without such comforts in some creatures,
								and in some other creatures such sweetness and comforts be but seldom.</p>
							<p>
								And all this is after the disposition and the ordinance of God, all after the profit
								and the needfulness of diverse creatures. For some creatures be so weak and so tender
								in spirit, that unless they were somewhat comforted by feeling of such sweetness,
								they might on nowise abide nor bear the diversity of temptations and tribulations
								that they suffer and be travailed with in this life of their bodily and ghostly
								enemies. And some there be that they be so weak in body that they may do no great
								penance to cleanse them with. And these creatures will our Lord cleanse full graciously
								in spirit by such sweet feelings and weepings. And also on the tother part there
								be some creatures so strong in spirit, that they can pick them comfort enough within
								in their souls, in offering up of this reverent and this meek stirring of love and
								accordance of will, that them needeth not much to be fed with such sweet comforts
								in bodily feelings. Which of these be holier or more dear with God, one than another,
								God wots and I not.</p>
