							<h4>
								One and Sixtieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>That all bodily thing is subject unto ghostly thing, and is ruled thereafter by
									the course of nature and not contrariwise.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								NEVERTHELESS it is needful to lift up our eyes and our hands bodily, as it were
								unto yon bodily heaven, in the which the elements be fastened. I mean if we be stirred
								of the work of our spirit, and else not. For all bodily thing is subject unto ghostly
								thing, and is ruled thereafter, and not contrariwise.</p>
							<p>
								Ensample hereof may be seen by the ascension of our Lord: for when the time appointed
								was come, that Him liked to wend to His Father bodily in His manhood, the which
								was never nor never may be absent in His Godhead, then mightily by the virtue of
								the Spirit God, the manhood with the body followed in onehead of person. The visibility
								of this was most seemly, and most according, to be upward.</p>
							<p>
								This same subjection of the body to the spirit may be in manner verily conceived
								in the proof of this ghostly work of this book, by them that work therein. For what
								time that a soul disposeth him effectually to this work, then as fast suddenly,
								unwitting himself that worketh, the body that peradventure before ere he began was
								somewhat bent downwards, on one side or on other for ease of the flesh, by virtue
								of the spirit shall set it upright: following in manner and in likeness bodily the
								work of the spirit that is made ghostly. And thus it is most seemly to be.</p>
							<p>
								And for this seemliness it is, that a man—the which is the seemliest creature in
								body that ever God made—is not made crooked to the earthwards, as be an other beasts,
								but upright to heavenwards. For why? That it should figure in likeness bodily the
								work of the soul ghostly; the which falleth to be upright ghostly, and not crooked
								ghostly. Take heed that I say upright ghostly, and not bodily. For how should a
								soul, the which in his nature hath no manner thing of bodilyness, be strained upright
								bodily? Nay, it may not be.</p>
							<p>
								And therefore be wary that thou conceive not bodily that which is meant ghostly,
								although it be spoken in bodily words, as be these, up or down, in or out, behind
								or before, on one side or on other. For although that a thing be never so ghostly
								in itself, nevertheless yet if it shall be spoken of, since it so is that speech
								is a bodily work wrought with the tongue, the which is an instrument of the body,
								it behoveth always be spoken in bodily words. But what thereof? Shall it therefore
								be taken and conceived bodily? Nay, but ghostly, as it be meant.</p>

							<h4>
								Two and Sixtieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>How a man may wit when his ghostly work is beneath him or without him, and when
									it is even with him or within him, and when it is above him and under his God.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND for this, that thou shalt be able better to wit how they shall be conceived
								ghostly, these words that be spoken bodily, therefore I think to declare to thee
								the ghostly bemeaning of some words that fall to ghostly working. So that thou mayest
								wit clearly without error when thy ghostly work is beneath thee and without thee,
								and when it is within thee and even with thee, and when it is above thee and under
								thy God.</p>
							<p>
								All manner of bodily thing is without thy soul and beneath it in nature, yea! the
								sun and the moon and all the stars, although they be above thy body, nevertheless
								yet they be beneath thy soul.</p>
							<p>
								All angels and all souls, although they be confirmed and adorned with grace and
								with virtues, for the which they be above thee in cleanness, nevertheless, yet they
								be but even with thee in nature.</p>
							<p>
								Within in thyself in nature be the powers of thy soul: the which be these three
								principal, Memory, Reason, and Will; and secondary, Imagination and Sensuality.</p>
							<p>
								Above thyself in nature is no manner of thing but only God.</p>
							<p>
								Evermore where thou findest written thyself in ghostliness, then it is understood
								thy soul, and not thy body. And then all after that thing is on the which the powers
								of thy soul work, thereafter shall the worthiness and the condition of thy work
								be deemed; whether it be beneath thee, within thee, or above thee.</p>

							<h4>
								Three and Sixtieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>Of the powers of a soul in general, and how Memory in special is a principal power,
									comprehending in it all the other powers and all those things in the which they
									work.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MEMORY is such a power in itself, that properly to speak and in manner, it worketh
								not itself. But Reason and Will, they be two working powers, and so is Imagination
								and Sensuality also. And all these four powers and their works, Memory containeth
								and comprehen-deth in itself. And otherwise it is not said that the Memory worketh,
								unless such a comprehension be a work.</p>
							<p>
								And therefore it is that I call the powers of a soul, some principal, and some secondary.
								Not because a soul is divisible, for that may not be: but because all those things
								in the which they work be divisible, and some principal, as be all ghostly things,
								and some secondary, as be all bodily things. The two principal working powers, Reason
								and Will, work purely in themselves in all ghostly things, without help of the other
								two secondary powers. Imagination and Sensuality work beastly in all bodily things,
								whether they be present or absent, in the body and with the bodily wits. But by
								them, without help of Reason and of Will, may a soul never come to for to know the
								virtue and the conditions of bodily creatures, nor the cause of their beings and
								their makings.</p>
							<p>
								And for this cause is Reason and Will called principal powers, for they work in
								pure spirit without any manner of bodilyness: and Imagination and Sensuality secondary,
								for they work in the body with bodily instruments, the which be our five wits. Memory
								is called a principal power, for it containeth in it ghostly not only all the other
								powers, but thereto all those things in the which they work. See by the proof.</p>

							<h4>
								Four and Sixtieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>Of the other two principal powers Reason and Will; and of the work of them before
									sin and after.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								REASON is a power through the which we depart the evil from the good, the evil from
								the worse, the good from the better, the worse from the worst, the better from the
								best. Before ere man sinned, might Reason have done all this by nature. But now
								it is so blinded with the original sin, that it may not con work this work, unless
								it be illumined by grace. And both the self Reason, and the thing that it worketh
								in, be comprehended and contained in the Memory.</p>
							<p>
								Will is a power through the which we choose good, after that it be determined with
								Reason; and through the which we love good, we desire good, and rest us with full
								liking and consent endlessly in God. Before ere man sinned, might not Will be deceived
								in his choosing, in his loving, nor in none of his works. For why, it had then by
								nature to savour each thing as it was; but now it may not do so, unless it be anointed
								with grace. For ofttimes because of infection of the original sin, it savoureth
								a thing for good that is full evil, and that hath but the likeness of good. And
								both the Will and the thing that is willed, the Memory containeth and comprehendeth
								in it.</p>

							<h4>
								Five and Sixtieth Capítulo
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>Of the first secondary power, Imagination by name; and of the works and the obedience
									of it unto Reason, before Sin and after.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								IMAGINATION is a power through the which we portray all images of absent and present
								things, and both it and the thing that it worketh in be contained in the Memory.
								Before ere man sinned, was Imagination so obedient unto the Reason, to the which
								it is as it were servant, that it ministered never to it any unordained image of
								any bodily creature, or any fantasy of any ghostly creature: but now it is not so.
								For unless it be refrained by the light of grace in the Reason, else it will never
								cease, sleeping or waking, for to portray diverse unordained images of bodily creatures;
								or else some fantasy, the which is nought else but a bodily conceit of a ghostly
								thing, or else a ghostly conceit of a bodily thing. And this is evermore feigned
								and false, and next unto error.</p>
							<p>
								This inobedience of the Imagination may clearly be conceived in them that be newlings
								turned from the world unto devotion, in the time of their prayer. For before the
								time be, that the Imagination be in great part refrained by the light of grace in
								the Reason, as it is in continual meditation of ghostly things—as be their own wretchedness,
								the passion and the kindness of our Lord God, with many such other—they may in nowise
								put away the wonderful and the diverse thoughts, fantasies, and images, the which
								be ministered and printed in their mind by the light of the curiosity of Imagination.
								And all this inobedience is the pain of the original sin.</p>
