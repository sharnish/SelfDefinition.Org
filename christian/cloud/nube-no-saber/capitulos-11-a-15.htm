							</p>
							<p>
								I SAY not this for that I trow that thou, or any other such as I speak of, be guilty
								and cumbered with any such sins; but for that I would that thou weighest each thought
								and each stirring after that it is, and for I would that thou travailedst busily
								to destroy the first stirring and thought of these things that thou mayest thus
								sin in. For one thing I tell thee; that who weigheth not, or setteth little by,
								the first thought—yea, although it be no sin unto him—that he, whosoever that he
								be, shall not eschew recklessness in venial sin. Venial sin shall no man utterly
								eschew in this deadly life. But recklessness in venial sin should always be eschewed
								of all the true disciples of perfection; and else I have no wonder though they soon
								sin deadly.</p>

							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>That by Virtue of this word sin is not only destroyed, but also Virtues begotten.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND, therefore, if thou wilt stand and not fall, cease never in thine intent: but
								beat evermore on this La nube del no-saber that is betwixt thee and thy God with a
								sharp dart of longing love, and loathe for to think on aught under God, and go not
								thence for anything that be-falleth. For this is only by itself that work that destroyeth
								the ground and the root of sin. Fast thou never so much, wake thou never so long,
								rise thou never so early, lie thou never so hard, wear thou never so sharp; yea,
								and if it were lawful to do—as it is not—put thou out thine eyes, cut thou out thy
								tongue of thy mouth, stop thou thine ears and thy nose never so fast, though thou
								shear away thy members, and do all the pain to thy body that thou mayest or canst
								think: all this would help thee right nought. Yet will stirring and rising of sin
								be in thee.</p>
							<p>
								Yea, and what more? Weep thou never so much for sorrow of thy sins, or of the Passion
								of Christ, or have thou never so much mind of the joys of heaven, what may it do
								to thee? Surely much good, much help, much profit, and much grace will it get thee.
								But in comparison of this blind stirring of love, it is but a little that it doth,
								or may do, without this. This by itself is the best part of Mary without these other.
								They without it profit but little or nought. It destroyeth not only the ground and
								the root of sin as it may be here, but thereto it getteth virtues. For an it be
								truly conceived, all virtues shall truly be, and perfectly conceived, and feelingly
								comprehended, in it, without any mingling of the intent. And have a man never so
								many virtues without it, all they be mingled with some crooked intent, for the which
								they be imperfect.</p>
							<p>
								For virtue is nought else but an ordained and a measured affection, plainly directed
								unto God for Himself. For why? He in Himself is the pure cause of all virtues: insomuch,
								that if any man be stirred to any one virtue by any other cause mingled with Him,
								yea, although that He be the chief, yet that virtue is then imperfect. As thus by
								example may be seen in one virtue or two instead of all the other; and well may
								these two virtues be meekness and charity. For whoso might get these two clearly,
								him needeth no more: for why, he hath all.</p>

							<h4>
								Capítulo 13
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>What meekness is in itself, and when it is perfect and when it is imperfect.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								NOW let see first of the virtue of meekness; how that it is imperfect when it is
								caused of any other thing mingled with God although He be the chief; and how that
								it is perfect when it is caused of God by Himself. And first it is to wit, what
								meekness is in itself, if this matter shall clearly be seen and conceived; and thereafter
								may it more verily be conceived in truth of spirit what is the cause thereof.</p>
							<p>
								Meekness in itself is nought else, but a true knowing and feeling of a man's self
								as he is. For surely whoso might verily see and feel himself as he is, he should
								verily be meek. Two things there be, the which be cause of this meekness; the which
								be these. One is the filth, the wretchedness, and the frailty of man, into the which
								he is fallen by sin; and the which always him behoveth to feel in some part the
								whiles he liveth in this life, be he never so holy. Another is the over-abundant
								love and the worthiness of God in Himself; in beholding of the which all nature
								quaketh, all clerks be fools, and all saints and angels be blind. Insomuch, that
								were it not that through the wisdom of His Godhead He measured their beholding after
								their ableness in nature and in grace, I defail to say what should befall them.</p>
							<p>
								This second cause is perfect; for why, it shall last without end. And the tother
								before is imperfect; for why, it shall not only fail at the end of this life, but
								full oft it may befall that a soul in this deadly body for abundance of grace in
								multiplying of his desire—as oft and as long as God vouchsafeth for to work it—shall
								have suddenly and perfectly lost and forgotten all witting and feeling of his being,
								not looking after whether he have been holy or wretched. But whether this fall oft
								or seldom to a soul that is thus disposed, I trow that it lasteth but a full short
								while: and in this time it is perfectly meeked, for it knoweth and feeleth no cause
								but the Chief. And ever when it knoweth and feeleth the tother cause, communing
								therewith, although this be the chief: yet it is imperfect meekness. Nevertheless
								yet it is good and notwithstanding must be had; and God forbid that thou take it
								in any other manner than I say.</p>

							<h4>
								Capítulo 14
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>That without imperfect meekness coming before, it is impossible for a sinner to
									come to the perfect Virtue of meekness in this life.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								FOR although I call it imperfect meekness, yet I had liefer have a true knowing
								and a feeling of myself as I am, and sooner I trow that it should get me the perfect
								cause and virtue of meekness by itself, than it should an all the saints and angels
								in heaven, and all the men and women of Holy Church living in earth, religious or
								seculars in all degrees, were set at once all together to do nought else but to
								pray to God for me to get me perfect meekness. Yea, and yet it is impossible a sinner
								to get, or to keep when it is gotten, the perfect virtue of meekness without it.</p>
							<p>
								And therefore swink and sweat in all that thou canst and mayest, for to get thee
								a true knowing and a feeling of thyself as thou art; and then I trow that soon after
								that thou shalt have a true knowing and a feeling of God as He is. Not as He is
								in Himself, for that may no man do but Himself; nor yet as thou shalt do in bliss
								both body and soul together. But as it is possible, and as He vouchsafeth to be
								known and felt of a meek soul living in this deadly body.</p>
							<p>
								And think not because I set two causes of meekness, one perfect and another imperfect,
								that I will therefore that thou leavest the travail about imperfect meekness, and
								set thee wholly to get thee perfect. Nay, surely; I trow thou shouldest never bring
								it so about. But herefore I do that I do: because I think to tell thee and let thee
								see the worthiness of this ghostly exercise before all other exercise bodily or
								ghostly that man can or may do by grace. How that a privy love pressed in cleanness
								of spirit upon this dark La nube del no-saber betwixt thee and thy God, truly and
								perfectly containeth in it the perfect virtue of meekness without any special or
								clear beholding of any thing under God. And because I would that thou knewest which
								were perfect meekness, and settest it as a token before the love of thine heart,
								and didst it for thee and for me. And because I would by this knowing make thee
								more meek.</p>
							<p>
								For ofttimes it befalleth that lacking of knowing is cause of much pride as me thinketh.
								For peradventure an thou knewest not which were perfect meekness, thou shouldest
								ween when thou hadst a little knowing and a feeling of this that I call imperfect
								meekness, that thou hadst almost gotten perfect meekness: and so shouldest thou
								deceive thyself, and ween that thou wert full meek when thou wert all belapped in
								foul stinking pride. And therefore try for to travail about perfect meekness; for
								the condition of it is such, that whoso hath it, and the whiles he hath it, he shall
								not sin, nor yet much after.</p>

							<h4>
								Capítulo 15
							</h4>
							<p>
								<em>A short proof against their error that say, that there is no perfecter cause to
									be meeked under, than is the knowledge of a man's own wretchedness.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND trust steadfastly that there is such a perfect meekness as I speak of, and that
								it may be come to through grace in this life. And this I say in confusion of their
								error, that say that there is no perfecter cause of meekness than is that which
								is raised of the remembrance of our wretchedness and our before-done sins.</p>
							<p>
								I grant well, that to them that have been in accustomed sins, as I am myself and
								have been, it is the most needful and speedful cause, to be meeked under the remembrance
								of our wretchedness and our before-done sins, ever till the time be that the great
								rust of sin be in great part rubbed away, our conscience and our counsel to witness.
								But to other that be, as it were, innocents, the which never sinned deadly with
								an abiding will and avisement, but through frailty and unknowing, and the which
								set them to be contemplatives—and to us both if our counsel and our conscience witness
								our lawful amendment in contrition and in confession, and in making satisfaction
								after the statute and the ordinance of all-Holy Church, and thereto if we feel us
								stirred and called by grace to be contemplatives also—there is then another cause
								to be meeked under as far above this cause as is the living of our Lady Saint Mary
								above the living of the sinfullest penitent in Holy Church; or the living of Christ
								above the living of any other man in this life; or else the living of an angel in
								heaven, the which never felt—nor shall feel—frailty, is above the life of the frailest
								man that is here in this world.</p>
							<p>
								For if it so were that there were no perfect cause to be meeked under, but in seeing
								and feeling of wretchedness, then would I wit of them that say so, what cause they
								be meeked under that never see nor feel—nor never shall be in them—wretchedness
								nor stirring of sin: as it is of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, our Lady Saint Mary, and
								all the saints and angels in heaven. To this perfection, and all other, our Lord
								JESUS CHRIST calleth us Himself in the gospel: where He biddeth that we should be
								perfect by grace as He Himself is by nature.</p>
