                                AND therefore lean meekly to this blind stirring of love in thine heart. I mean
                                not in thy bodily heart, but in thy ghostly heart, the which is thy will. And be
                                well wary that thou conceive not bodily that that is said ghostly. For truly I tell
                                thee, that bodily and fleshly conceits of them that have curious and imaginative
                                wits be cause of much error.</p>

                                Ensample of this mayest thou see, by that that I bid thee hide thy desire from God
                                in that that in thee is. For peradventure an I had bidden thee shew thy desire unto
                                God, thou shouldest have conceived it more bodily than thou dost now, when I bid
                                thee hide it. For thou wottest well, that all that thing that is wilfully hidden,
                                it is cast into the deepness of spirit. And thus me thinketh that it needeth greatly
                                to have much wariness in understanding of words that be spoken to ghostly intent,
                                so that thou conceive them not bodily but ghostly, as they be meant: and specially
                                it is good to be wary with this word <em>in,</em> and this word <em>up.</em> For
                                in misconceiving of these two words hangeth much error, and much deceit in them
                                that purpose them to be ghostly workers, as me thinketh. Somewhat wot I by the proof,
                                and somewhat by hearsay; and of these deceits list me tell thee a little as me thinketh.</p>
                            <p>
                                A young disciple in God's school new turned from the world, the same weeneth that
                                for a little time that he hath given him to penance and to prayer, taken by counsel
                                in confession, that he be therefore able to take upon him ghostly working of the
                                which he heareth men speak or read about him, or peradventure readeth himself. And
                                therefore when they read or hear spoken of ghostly working—and specially of this
                                word, &quot;how a man shall draw all his wit within himself,&quot; or &quot;how
                                he shall climb above himself'—as fast for blindness in soul, and for fleshliness
                                and curiosity of natural wit, they misunderstand these words, and ween, because
                                they find in them a natural covetyse to hid things, that they be therefore called
                                to that work by grace. Insomuch, that if counsel will not accord that they shall
                                work in this work, as soon they feel a manner of grumbling against their counsel,
                                and think—yea and peradventure say to such other as they be—that they can find no
                                man that can wit what they mean fully. And therefore as fast, for boldness and presumption
                                of their curious wit, they leave meek prayer and penance over soon; and set them,
                                they ween, to a full ghostly work within in their soul. The which work, an it be
                                truly conceived, is neither bodily working nor ghostly working; and shortly to say,
                                it is a working against nature, and the devil is the chief worker thereof. And it
                                is the readiest way to death of body and of soul, for it is madness
                                and no wisdom, and leadeth a man even to madness. And yet they ween not thus: for
                                they purpose them in this work to think on nought but on God.</p>

                                AND on this manner is this madness wrought that I speak of. They read and hear well
                                said that they should leave outward working with their wits, and work inwards: and
                                because that they know not which is inward working, therefore they work wrong. For
                                they turn their bodily wits inwards to their body against the course of nature;
                                and strain them, as they would see inwards with their bodily eyes and hear inwards
                                with their ears, and so forth of all their wits, smelling, tasting, and feeling
                                inwards. And thus they reverse them against the course of nature, and with this
                                curiosity they travail their imagination so indiscreetly, that at the last they
                                turn their brain in their heads, and then as fast the devil hath power for to feign
                                some false light or sounds, sweet smells in their noses, wonderful tastes in their
                                mouths; and many quaint heats and burnings in their bodily breasts or in their bowels,
                                in their backs and in their reins and in their members.</p>
                            <p>
                                And yet in this fantasy them think that they have a restful remembrance of their
                                God without any letting of vain thoughts; and surely so have they in manner, for
                                they be so filled in falsehood that vanity may not provoke them. And why? Because
                                he, that same fiend that should minister vain thoughts to them an they were in good
                                way—he, that same, is the chief worker of this work. And wit thou right well, that
                                him list not to let himself. The remembrance of God will he not put from them, for
                                fear that he should be had in suspect.</p>

                                MANY wonderful practices follow them that be deceived in this false work, or in
                                any species thereof, beyond that doth them that be God's true disciples: for they
                                be evermore full seemly in all their practices, bodily or ghostly. But it is not
                                so of these other. For whoso would or might behold unto them where they sit in this
                                time, an it so were that their eyelids were open, he should see them stare as they
                                were mad, and leeringly look as if they saw the devil. Surely it is good they be
                                wary, for truly the fiend is not far. Some set their eyes in their heads as they
                                were sturdy sheep beaten in the head, and as they should die anon. Some hang their
                                heads on one side as if a worm were in their ears. Some pipe when they should speak,
                                as if there were no spirit in their bodies: and this is the proper condition of
                                an hypocrite. Some cry and whine in their throats, so be they greedy and hasty to
                                say that they think: and this is the condition of heretics, and of them that with
                                presumption and with curiosity of wit will always maintain error.</p>
                            <p>
                                Many unordained and unseemly practices follow on this error, whoso might perceive
                                all. Nevertheless some there be that be so curious that they can refrain them in
                                great part when they come before men. But might these men be seen in place where
                                they be homely, then I trow they should not be hid. And nevertheless yet I trow
                                that whoso would straitly gainsay their opinion, that they should soon see them
                                burst out in some point; and yet them think that all that ever they do, it is for
                                the love of God and for to maintain the truth. Now truly I hope that unless God
                                shew His merciful miracle to make them soon leave off, they shall love God so long
                                on this manner, that they shall go staring mad to the devil. I say not that the
                                devil hath so perfect a servant in this life, that is deceived and infect with all
                                these fantasies that I set here: and nevertheless yet it may be that one, yea, and
                                many one, be infect with them all. But I say that he hath no perfect hypocrite nor
                                heretic in earth that he is not guilty in some that I have said, or peradventure
                                shall say if God vouchsafeth.</p>
                            <p>
                                For some men are so cumbered in nice curious customs in bodily bearing, that when
                                they shall ought hear, they writhe their heads on one side quaintly, and up with
                                the chin: they gape with their mouths as they should hear with their mouth and not
                                with their ears. Some when they should speak point with their fingers, either on
                                their fingers, or on their own breasts, or on theirs that they speak to. Some can
                                neither sit still, stand still, nor lie still, unless they be either wagging with
                                their feet or else somewhat doing with their hands. Some row with their arms in
                                time of their speaking, as them needed for to swim over a great water. Some be evermore
                                smiling and laughing at every other word that they speak, as they were giggling
                                girls and nice japing jugglers lacking behaviour. Seemly cheer were full fair, with
                                sober and demure bearing of body and mirth in manner.</p>
                            <p>
                                I say not that all these unseemly practices be great sins in themselves, nor yet
                                all those that do them be great sinners themselves. But I say if that these unseemly
                                and un-ordained practices be governors of that man that doth them, insomuch that
                                he may not leave them when he will, then I say that they be tokens of pride and
                                curiosity of wit, and of unordained shewing and covetyse of knowing. And specially
                                they be very tokens of unstable-ness of heart and unrestfulness of mind, and specially
                                of the lacking of the work of this book. And this is the only reason why that I
                                set so many of these deceits here in this writing; for why, that a ghostly worker
                                shall prove his work by them.</p>

                                by grace to work in this work, their favour should suddenly and graciously be changed:
                                that each good man that them saw, should be fain and joyful to have them in company,

                                He should well give discretion, if need were, of all natures and all dispositions.
                                He should well con make himself like unto all that with him communed, whether they
                                were accustomed sinners or none, without sin in himself: in wondering of all that
                                him saw, and in drawing of others by help of grace to the work of that same spirit
                                that he worketh in himself.</p>
                            <p>
                                His cheer and his words should be full of ghostly wisdom, full of fire, and of fruit
                                spoken in sober soothfastness without any falsehood, far from any feigning or piping
                                of hypocrites. For some there be that with all their might, inner and outer, imagineth
                                in their speaking how they may stuff them and underprop them on each side from falling,
                                with many meek piping words and gestures of devotion: more looking after for to
                                seem holy in sight of men, than for to be so in the sight of God and His angels.
                                For why, these folk will more weigh, and more sorrow make for an unordained gesture
                                or unseemly or unfitting word spoken before men, than they will for a thousand vain
                                thoughts and stinking stirrings of sin wilfully drawn upon them, or recklessly used
                                in the sight of God and the saints and the angels in heaven. Ah, Lord God! where
                                there be any pride within, there such meek piping words be so plenteous without.
                                I grant well, that it is fitting and seemly to them that be meek within, for to
                                shew meek and seemly words and gestures without, according to that meekness that
                                is within in the heart. But I say not that they shall then be shewed in broken nor
                                in piping voices, against the plain disposition of their nature that speak them.
                                For why, if they be true, then be they spoken in soothfastness, and in wholeness
                                of voice and of their spirit that speak them. And if he that hath a plain and an
                                open boisterous voice by nature speak them poorly and pipingly—I mean but if he
                                be sick in his body, or else that it be betwixt him and his God or his confessor—then
                                it is a very token of hypocrisy. I mean either young hypocrisy or old.</p>
                            <p>
                                And what shall I more say of these venomous deceits? Truly I trow, unless they have
                                grace to leave off such piping hypocrisy, that betwixt that privy pride in their
                                hearts within and such meek words without, the silly soul may full soon sink into
                                sorrow.</p>

                                <em>How they be deceived that follow the fervour of spirit in condemning of some without

                                SOME men the fiend will deceive on this manner. Full wonderfully he will enflame
                                their brains to maintain God's law, and to destroy sin in all other men. He will
                                never tempt them with a thing that is openly evil; he maketh them like busy prelates
                                watching over all the degrees of Christian men's living, as an abbot over his monks.
                                ALL men will they reprove of their defaults, right as they had cure of their souls:
                                and yet they think that they do not else for God, unless they tell them their defaults
                                that they see. And they say that they be stirred thereto by the fire of charity,
                                and of God's love in their hearts: and truly they lie, for it is with the fire of
                                hell, welling in their brains and in their imagination.</p>
                            <p>
                                That this is sooth, it seemeth by this that followeth. The devil is a spirit, and
                                of his own nature he hath no body, more than hath an angel. But yet nevertheless
                                what time that he or an angel shall take any body by leave of God, to make any ministration
                                to any man in this life; according as the work is that he shall minister, thereafter
                                in likeness is the quality of his body in some part. Ensample of this we have in
                                Holy Writ. As oft as any angel was sent in body in the Old Testament and in the
                                New also, evermore it was shewed, either by his name or by some instrument or quality
                                of his body, what his matter or his message was in spirit. On the same manner it
                                fareth of the fiend. For when he appeareth in body, he fig-ureth in some quality
                                of his body what his servants be in spirit. Ensample of this may be seen in one
                                instead of all these other. For as I have conceived by some disciples of necromancy,
                                the which have it in science for to make advocation of wicked spirits, and by some
                                unto whom the fiend hath appeared in bodily likeness; that in what bodily likeness
                                the fiend appeareth, evermore he hath but one nostril, and that is great and wide,
                                and he will gladly cast it up that a man may see in thereat to his brain up in his
                                head. The which brain is nought else but the fire of hell, for the fiend may have
                                none other brain; and if he might make a man look in thereto, he wants no better.
                                For at that looking, he should lose his wits for ever. But a perfect prentice of
                                necromancy knoweth this well enough, and can well ordain therefore, so that he provoke
                                him not.</p>
                            <p>
                                Therefore it is that I say, and have said, that evermore when the devil taketh any
                                body, he figureth in some quality of his body what his servants be in spirit. For
                                he enflameth so the imagination of his contemplatives with the fire of hell, that
                                suddenly without discretion they shoot out their curious conceits, and without any
                                advisement they will take upon them to blame other men's defaults over soon: and
                                this is because they have but one nostril ghostly.</p>
                            <p>
                                For that division that is in a man's nose bodily, and the which departeth the one
                                nostril from the tother, betokeneth that a man should have discretion ghostly; and
                                can dissever the good from the evil, and the evil from the worse, and the good from
                                the better, ere that he gave any full doom of anything that he heard or saw done
                                or spoken about him. And by a man's brain is ghostly understood imagination; for
                                by nature it dwelleth and worketh in the head.</p>
