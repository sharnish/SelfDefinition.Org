                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                <em>The true exposition of this gospel word, &quot;Mary hath chosen the best part.&quot;</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                WHAT meaneth this; Mary hath chosen the best? Wheresoever the best is set or named,
                                it asketh before it these two things—a good, and a better; so that it be the best,
                                and the third in number. But which be these three good things, of the which Mary
                                chose the best? Three lives be they not, for Holy Church maketh remembrance but
                                of two, active life and contemplative life; the which two lives be privily understood
                                in the story of this gospel by these two sisters Martha and Mary—by Martha active,
                                by Mary contemplative. Without one of these two lives may no man be safe, and where
                                no more be but two, may no man choose the best.</p>
                            <p>
                                But although there be but two lives, nevertheless yet in these two lives be three
                                parts, each one better than other. The which three, each one by itself, be specially
                                set in their places before in this writing. For as it is said before, the first
                                part standeth in good and honest bodily works of mercy and of charity; and this
                                is the first degree of active life, as it is said before. The second part of these
                                two lives lieth in good ghostly meditations of a man's own wretchedness, the Passion
                                of Christ, and of the joys of heaven. The first part is good, and this part is the
                                better; for this is the second degree of active life and the first of contemplative
                                life. In this part is contemplative life and active life coupled together in ghostly
                                kinship, and made sisters at the ensample of Martha and Mary. Thus high may an active
                                come to contemplation; and no higher, but if it be full seldom and by a special
                                grace. Thus low may a contemplative come towards active life; and no lower, but
                                if it be full seldom and in great need.</p>
                            <p>
                                The third part of these two lives hangeth in this dark cloud of unknowing, with
                                many a privy love pressed to God by Himself. The first part is good, the second
                                is better, but the third is best of all. This is the &quot;best part&quot; of Mary.
                                And therefore it is plainly to wit, that our Lord said not, Mary hath chosen the
                                best <em>life;</em> for there be no more lives but two, and of two may no man choose
                                the best. But of these two lives Mary hath chosen, He said, the best <em>part;</em>
                                the which shall never be taken from her. The first part and the second, although
                                they be both good and holy, yet they end with this life. For in the tother life
                                shall be no need as now to use the works of mercy, nor to weep for our wretchedness,
                                nor for the Passion of Christ. For then shall none be able to hunger nor thirst
                                as now, nor die for cold, nor be sick, nor houseless, nor in prison; nor yet need
                                burial, for then shall none be able to die. But the third part that Mary chose,
                                choose who by grace is called to choose: or, if I soothlier shall say, whoso is
                                chosen thereto of God. Let him lustily incline thereto, for that shall never be
                                taken away: for if it begin here, it shall last without end.</p>
                            <p>
                                And therefore let the voice of our Lord cry on these actives, as if He said thus
                                now for us unto them, as He did then for Mary to Martha, &quot;Martha, Martha!&quot;—&quot;Actives,
                                actives! make you as busy as ye can in the first part and in the second, now in
                                the one and now in the tother: and, if you list right well and feel you disposed,
                                in both two bodily. And meddle you not of contemplatives. Ye wot not what them aileth:
                                let them sit in their rest and in their play, with the third and the best part of
                                Mary.&quot;</p>

                                SWEET was that love betwixt our Lord and Mary. Much love had she to Him. Much more
                                had He to her. For whoso would utterly behold all the behaviour that was betwixt
                                Him and her, not as a trifler may tell, but as the story of the gospel will witness—the
                                which on nowise may be false—he should find that she was so heartily set for to
                                love Him, that nothing beneath Him might comfort her, nor yet hold her heart from
                                Him. This is she, that same Mary, that when she sought Him at the sepulchre with
                                weeping cheer would not be comforted of angels. For when they spake unto her so
                                sweetly and so lovely and said, &quot;Weep not, Mary; for why, our Lord whom thou
                                seekest is risen, and thou shalt have Him, and see Him live full fair amongst His
                                disciples in Galilee as He hight,&quot; she would not cease for them. For why? Her
                                thought that whoso sought verily the King of Angels, them list not cease for angels.</p>
                            <p>
                                And what more? Surely whoso will look verily in the story of the gospel, he shall
                                find many wonderful points of perfect love written of her to our ensample, and as
                                even according to the work of this writing, as if they had been set and written
                                therefore; and surely so were they, take whoso take may. And if a man list for to
                                see in the gospel written the wonderful and the special love that our Lord had to
                                her, in person of all accustomed sinners truly turned and called to the grace of
                                contemplation, he shall find that our Lord might not suffer any man or woman—yea,
                                not her own sister—speak a word against her, but if He answered for her Himself.
                                Yea, and what more? He blamed Symon Leprous in his own house, for that he thought
                                against her. This was great love: this was passing love.</p>

                                all these other; if He see that we will not leave the work of His love for business
                                about them. And this I say in confusion of their error, that say that it is not
                                lawful for men to set them to serve God in contemplative life, but if they be secure
                                before of their bodily necessaries. For they say, that God sendeth the cow, but
                                not by the horn. And truly they say wrong of God, as they well know. For trust steadfastly,
                                thou whatsoever that thou be, that truly turnest thee from the world unto God, that
                                one of these two God shall send thee, without business of thyself: and that is either
                                abundance of necessaries, or strength in body and patience in spirit to bear need.
                                What then recketh it, which man have? for all come to one in very contemplatives.
                                And whoso is in doubt of this, either the devil is in his breast and reeveth him
                                of belief, or else he is not yet truly turned to God as he should be; make he it
                                never so quaint, nor never so holy reasons shew there again, whatnot ever that he
                                be.</p>
                            <p>
                                And therefore thou, that settest thee to be contemplative as Mary was, choose thee
                                rather to be meeked under the wonderful height and the worthiness of God, the which
                                is perfect, than under thine own wretchedness, the which is imperfect: that is to
                                say, look that thy special beholding be more to the worthiness of God than to thy
                                wretchedness. For to them that be perfectly meeked, no thing shall defail; neither
                                bodily thing, nor ghostly. For why? They have God, in whom is all plenty; and whoso
                                hath Him—yea, as this book tell-eth—him needeth nought else in this life.</p>

                                <em>What charity is in itself, and how it is truly and perfectly contained in the work
                                    of this book.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AND as it is said of meekness, how that it is truly and perfectly comprehended in
                                this little blind love pressed, when it is beating upon this dark cloud of unknowing,
                                all other things put down and forgotten: so it is to be understood of all other
                                virtues, and specially of charity.</p>
                            <p>
                                For charity is nought else to bemean to thine understanding, but love of God for
                                Himself above all creatures, and of man for God even as thyself. And that in this
                                work God is loved for Himself, and above all creatures, it seemeth right well. For
                                as it is said before, that the substance of this work is nought else but a naked
                                intent directed unto God for Himself.</p>
                            <p>
                                A naked intent I call it. For why, in this work a perfect Prentice asketh neither
                                releasing of pain, nor increasing of meed, nor shortly to say, nought but Himself.
                                Insomuch, that neither he recketh nor looketh after whether that he be in pain or
                                in bliss, else that His will be fulfilled that he loveth. And thus it seemeth that
                                in this work God is perfectly loved for Himself, and that above all creatures. For
                                in this work, a perfect worker may not suffer the memory of the holiest creature
                                that ever God made to commune with him.</p>
                            <p>
                                And that in this work the second and the lower branch of charity unto thine even-christian
                                is verily and perfectly fulfilled, it seemeth by the proof. For why, in this work
                                a perfect worker hath no special beholding unto any man by himself, whether that
                                he be kin or stranger, friend or foe. For all men him thinks equally kin unto him,
                                and no man stranger. All men him thinks be his friends, and none his foes. Insomuch,
                                that him thinks all those that pain him and do him disease in this life, they be
                                his full and his special friends: and him thinketh, that he is stirred to will them
                                as much good, as he would to the homeliest friend that he hath.</p>

                                <em>That in the time of this work a perfect soul hath no special beholding to any one
                                    man in this life.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I SAY not that in this work he shall have a special beholding to any man in this
                                life, whether that he be friend or foe, kin or stranger; for that may not be if
                                this work shall perfectly be done, as it is when all things under God be fully forgotten,
                                as falleth for this work. But I say that he shall be made so virtuous and so charitable
                                by the virtue of this work, that his will shall be afterwards, when he condescendeth
                                to commune or to pray for his even-christi-an—not from all this work, for that may
                                not be without great sin, but from the height of this work, the which is speedful
                                and needful to do some time as charity asketh—as specially then directed to his
                                foe as to his friend, his stranger as his kin. Yea, and some time more to his foe
                                than to his friend.</p>
                            <p>
                                Nevertheless, in this work he hath no leisure to look after who is his friend or
                                his foe, his kin or his stranger. I say not but he shall feel some time—yea, full
                                oft—his affection more homely to one, two, or three, than to all these other: for
                                that is lawful to be, for many causes as charity asketh. For such an homely affection
                                felt Christ to John and unto Mary, and unto Peter before many others. But I say,
                                that in the time of this work shall all be equally homely unto him; for he shall
                                feel then no cause, but only God. So that all shall be loved plainly and nakedly
                                for God, and as well as himself.</p>
                            <p>
                                For as all men were lost in Adam and all men that with work will witness their will
                                of salvation are saved or shall be by virtue of the Passion of only Christ: not
                                in the same manner, but as it were in the same manner, a soul that is perfectly
                                disposed to this work, and oned thus to God in spirit as the proof of this work
                                witnesseth, doth that in it is to make all men as perfect in this work as itself
                                is. For right as if a limb of our body feeleth sore, all the tother limbs be pained
                                and diseased therefore, or if a limb fare well, all the remnant be gladded therewith—right
                                so is it ghostly of all the limbs of Holy Church. For Christ is our head, and we
                                be the limbs if we be in charity: and whoso will be a perfect disciple of our Lord's,
                                him behoveth strain up his spirit in this work ghostly, for the salvation of all
                                his brethren and sisters in nature, as our Lord did His body on the Cross. And how?
                                Not only for His friends and His kin and His homely lovers, but generally for all
                                mankind, without any special beholding more to one than to another. For all that
                                will leave sin and ask mercy shall be saved through the virtue of His Passion. And
                                as it is said of meekness and charity, so it is to be understood of all other virtues.
                                For all they be truly comprehended in this little pressing of love, touched before.</p>
