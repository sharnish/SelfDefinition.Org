                                <em>A short conceit of the work of this book, treated by question.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                BUT now thou askest me and sayest, &quot;How shall I think on Himself, and what
                                is He?&quot; and to this I cannot answer thee but thus: &quot;I wot not.&quot;</p>
                            <p>
                                For thou hast brought me with thy question into that same darkness, and into that
                                same cloud of unknowing, that I would thou wert in thyself. For of all other creatures
                                and their works, yea, and of the works of God's self, may a man through grace have
                                fullhead of knowing, and well he can think of them: but of God Himself can no man
                                think. And therefore I would leave all that thing that I can think, and choose to
                                my love that thing that I cannot think. For why; He may well be loved, but not thought.
                                By love may He be gotten and holden; but by thought never. And therefore, although
                                it be good sometime to think of the kindness and the worthiness of God in special,
                                and although it be a light and a part of contemplation: nevertheless yet in this
                                work it shall be cast down and covered with a cloud of forgetting. And thou shalt
                                step above it stalwartly, but Mistily, with a devout and a pleasing stirring of
                                love, and try for to pierce that darkness above thee. And smite upon that thick
                                cloud of unknowing with a sharp dart of longing love; and go not thence for thing
                                that be-falleth.</p>

                                And if he ask thee, &quot;What is that God?&quot; say thou, that it is God that
                                made thee and bought thee, and that graciously hath called thee to thy degree. &quot;And
                                in Him,&quot; say, &quot;thou hast no skill.&quot; And therefore say, &quot;Go thou
                                down again,&quot; and tread him fast down with a stirring of love, although he seem
                                to thee right holy, and seem to thee as he would help thee to seek Him. For peradventure
                                he will bring to thy mind diverse full fair and wonderful points of His kindness,
                                and say that He is full sweet, and full loving, full gracious, and full merciful.
                                And if thou wilt hear him, he coveteth no better; for at the last he will thus jangle
                                ever more and more till he bring thee lower, to the mind of His Passion.</p>
                            <p>
                                And there will he let thee see the wonderful kindness of God, and if thou hear him,
                                he careth for nought better. For soon after he will let thee see thine old wretched
                                living, and peradventure in seeing and thinking thereof he will bring to thy mind
                                some place that thou hast dwelt in before this time. So that at the last, or ever
                                thou wit, thou shalt be scattered thou wottest not where. The cause of this scattering
                                is, that thou heardest him first wilfully, then answeredest him, receivedest him,
                                and lettest him alone.</p>
                            <p>
                                And yet, nevertheless, the thing that he said was both good and holy. Yea, and so
                                holy, that what man or woman that weeneth to come to contemplation without many
                                such sweet meditations of their own wretchedness, the passion, the kindness, and
                                the great goodness, and the worthiness of God coming before, surely he shall err
                                and fail of his purpose. And yet, nevertheless, it behoveth a man or a woman that
                                hath long time been used in these meditations, nevertheless to leave them, and put
                                them and hold them far down under the cloud of forgetting, if ever he shall pierce
                                the cloud of unknowing betwixt him and his God. Therefore what time that thou purposest
                                thee to this work, and feelest by grace that thou art called of God, lift then up
                                thine heart unto God with a meek stirring of love; and mean God that made thee,
                                and bought thee, and that graciously hath called thee to thy degree, and receive
                                none other thought of God. And yet not all these, but if thou list; for it sufficeth
                                enough, a naked intent direct unto God without any other cause than Himself.</p>
                            <p>
                                And if thee list have this intent lapped and folden in one word, for thou shouldest
                                have better hold thereupon, take thee but a little word of one syllable: for so
                                it is better than of two, for ever the shorter it is the better it accordeth with
                                the work of the Spirit. And such a word is this word GOD or this word LOVE. Choose
                                thee whether thou wilt, or another; as thee list, which that thee liketh best of
                                one syllable. And fasten this word to thine heart, so that it never go thence for
                                thing that befalleth.</p>
                            <p>
                                This word shall be thy shield and thy spear, whether thou ridest on peace or on
                                war. With this word, thou shalt beat on this cloud and this darkness above thee.
                                With this word, thou shall smite down all manner of thought under the cloud of forgetting.
                                Insomuch, that if any thought press upon thee to ask thee what thou wouldest have,
                                answer them with no more words but with this one word. And if he proffer thee of
                                his great clergy to expound thee that word and to tell thee the conditions of that
                                word, say him: That thou wilt have it all whole, and not broken nor undone. And
                                if thou wilt hold thee fast on this purpose, be thou sure, he will no while abide.
                                And why? For that thou wilt not let him feed him on such sweet meditations of God
                                touched before.</p>

                                me so much good withal, then I have great marvel why that thou biddest me put him
                                down and away so far under the cloud of forgetting?&quot;</p>
                            <p>
                                Now surely me thinketh that this is a well moved question, and therefore I think
                                to answer thereto so feebly as I can. First when thou askest me what is he, this
                                that presseth so fast upon thee in this work, proffering to help thee in this work;
                                I say that it is a sharp and a clear beholding of thy natural wit, printed in thy
                                reason within in thy soul. And where thou askest me thereof whether it be good or
                                evil, I say that it behoveth always be good in its nature. For why, it is a beam
                                of the likeness of God. But the use thereof may be both good and evil. Good, when
                                it is opened by grace for to see thy wretchedness, the passion, the kindness, and
                                the wonderful works of God in His creatures bodily and ghostly. And then it is no
                                wonder though it increase thy devotion full much, as thou sayest. But then is the
                                use evil, when it is swollen with pride and with curiosity of much clergy and letterly
                                cunning as in clerks; and maketh them press for to be holden not meek scholars and
                                masters of divinity or of devotion, but proud scholars of the devil and masters
                                of vanity and of falsehood. And in other men or women whatso they be, religious
                                or seculars, the use and the working of this natural wit is then evil, when it is
                                swollen with proud and curious skills of worldly things, and fleshly conceits in
                                coveting of worldly worships and having of riches and vain plesaunce and flatterings
                                of others.</p>
                            <p>
                                And where that thou askest me, why that thou shalt put it down under the cloud of
                                forgetting, since it is so, that it is good in its nature, and thereto when it is
                                well used it doth thee so much good and increaseth thy devotion so much. To this
                                I answer and say—That thou shalt well understand that there be two manner of lives
                                in Holy Church. The one is active life, and the other is contemplative life. Active
                                is the lower, and contemplative is the higher. Active life hath two degrees, a higher
                                and a lower: and also contemplative life hath two degrees, a lower and a higher.
                                Also, these two lives be so coupled together that although they be divers in some
                                part, yet neither of them may be had fully without some part of the other. For why?
                                That part that is the higher part of active life, that same part is the lower part
                                of contemplative life. So that a man may not be fully active, but if he be in part
                                contemplative; nor yet fully contemplative, as it may be here, but if he be in part
                                active. The condition of active life is such, that it is both begun and ended in
                                this life; but not so of contemplative life. For it is begun in this life, and shall
                                last without end. For why? That part that Mary chose shall never be taken away.
                                Active life is troubled and travailed about many things; but contemplative sitteth
                                in peace with one thing.</p>
                            <p>
                                The lower part of active life standeth in good and honest bodily works of mercy
                                and of charity. The higher part of active life and the lower part of contemplative
                                life lieth in goodly ghostly meditations, and busy beholding unto a man's own wretchedness
                                with sorrow and contrition, unto the Passion of Christ and of His servants with
                                pity and compassion, and unto the wonderful gifts, kindness, and works of God in
                                all His creatures bodily and ghostly with thanking and praising. But the higher
                                part of contemplation, as it may be had here, hangeth all wholly in this darkness
                                and in this cloud of unknowing; with a loving stirring and a blind beholding unto
                                the naked being of God Himself only.</p>
                            <p>
                                In the lower part of active life a man is without himself and beneath himself. In
                                the higher part of active life and the lower part of contemplative life, a man is
                                within himself and even with himself. But in the higher part of contemplative life,
                                a man is above himself and under his God. Above himself he is: for why, he purposeth
                                him to win thither by grace, whither he may not come by nature. That is to say,
                                to be knit to God in spirit, and in onehead of love and accordance of will. And
                                right as it is impossible, to man's understanding, for a man to come to the higher
                                part of active life, but if he cease for a time of the lower part; so it is that
                                a man shall not come to the higher part of contemplative life, but if he cease for
                                a time of the lower part. And as unlawful a thing as it is, and as much as it would
                                let a man that sat in his meditations, to have regard then to his outward bodily
                                works, the which he had done, or else should do, although they were never so holy
                                works in themselves: surely as unlikely a thing it is, and as much would it let
                                a man that should work in this darkness and in this cloud of unknowing with an affectuous
                                stirring of love to God for Himself, for to let any thought or any meditation of
                                God's wonderful gifts, kindness, and works in any of His creatures bodily or ghostly,
                                rise upon him to press betwixt him and his God; although they be never so holy thoughts,
                                nor so profound, nor so comfortable.</p>
                            <p>
                                And for this reason it is that I bid thee put down such a sharp subtle thought,
                                and cover him with a thick cloud of forgetting, be he never so holy nor promise
                                he thee never so well for to help thee in thy purpose. For why, love may reach to
                                God in this life, but not knowing. And all the whiles that the soul dwelleth in
                                this deadly body, evermore is the</p>
                            <p>
                                sharpness of our understanding in beholding of all ghostly things, but most specially
                                of God, mingled with some manner of fantasy; for the which our work should be unclean.
                                And unless more wonder were, it should lead us into much error.</p>

                                upon thee when thou settest thee to this work, behoveth always be borne down; and
                                but thou bear him down, he will bear thee down. Insomuch, that when thou weenest
                                best to abide in this darkness, and that nought is in thy mind but only God; an
                                thou look truly thou shalt find thy mind not occupied in this darkness, but in a
                                clear beholding of some thing beneath God. And if it thus be, surely then is that
                                thing above thee for the time, and betwixt thee and thy God. And therefore purpose
                                thee to put down such clear beholdings, be they never so holy nor so likely. For
                                one thing I tell thee, it is more profitable to the health of thy soul, more worthy
                                in itself, and more pleasing to God and to all the saints and angels in heaven—yea,
                                and more helpful to all thy friends, bodily and ghostly, quick and dead—such a blind
                                stirring of love unto God for Himself, and such a privy pressing upon this cloud
                                of unknowing, and better thee were for to have it and for to feel it in thine affection
                                ghostly, than it is for to have the eyes of thy soul opened in contemplation or
                                beholding of all the angels or saints in heaven, or in hearing of all the mirth
                                and the melody that is amongst them in bliss.</p>

                                And look thou have no wonder of this: for mightest thou once see it as clearly,
                                as thou mayest by grace come to for to grope it and feel it in this life, thou wouldest
                                think as I say. But be thou sure that clear sight shall never man have here in this
                                life: but the feeling may men have through grace when God vouchsafeth. And therefore
                                lift up thy love to that cloud: rather, if I shall say thee sooth, let God draw
                                thy love up to that cloud and strive thou through help of His grace to forget all

                                thy witting putteth thee farther from God than thou shouldest be if it were not,
                                and letteth thee, and maketh thee inasmuch more unable to feel in experience the
                                fruit of His love, what trowest thou then that a remembrance wittingly and wilfully
                                drawn upon thee will hinder thee in thy purpose? And since a remembrance of any
                                special saint or of any clean ghostly thing will hinder thee so much, what trowest
                                thou then that the remembrance of any man living in this wretched life, or of any

                                advisement in increasing of thy devotion, although it be letting to this manner
                                of work—that it is therefore evil. Nay! God forbid that thou take it so. But I say,
                                although it be good and holy, yet in this work it letteth more than it profiteth.
                                I mean for the time. For why? Surely he that seeketh God perfectly, he will not
                                rest him finally in the remembrance of any angel or saint that is in heaven.</p>

                                suffered so long to abide unreproved, that then at the last it is fastened to the
                                ghostly heart, that is to say the will, with a full consent: then, it is deadly
                                sin. And this befalleth when thou or any of them that I speak of wilfully draw upon
                                thee the remembrance of any man or woman living in this life, or of any bodily or
                                worldly thing other: insomuch, that if it be a thing the which grieveth or hath
                                grieved thee before, there riseth in thee an angry passion and an appetite of vengeance,
                                the which is called Wrath. Or else a fell disdain and a manner of loathsomeness
                                of their person, with despiteful and condemning thoughts, the which is called Envy.
                                Or else a weariness and an unlistiness of any good occupation bodily or ghostly,
                                the which is called Sloth.</p>
                            <p>
                                And if it be a thing that pleaseth thee, or hath pleased thee before, there riseth
                                in thee a passing delight for to think on that thing what so it be. Insomuch, that
                                thou restest thee in that thought, and finally fastenest thine heart and thy will
                                thereto, and feedest thy fleshly heart therewith: so that thee think for the time
                                that thou covetest none other wealth, but to live ever in such a peace and rest
                                with that thing that thou thinkest upon. If this thought that thou thus drawest
                                upon thee, or else receivest when it is put unto thee, and that thou restest thee
                                thus in with delight, be worthiness of nature or of knowing, of grace or of degree,
                                of favour or of fairhead, then it is Pride. And if it be any manner of worldly good,
                                riches or chattels, or what that man may have or be lord of, then it is Covetyse.
                                If it be dainty meats and drinks, or any manner of delights that man may taste,
                                then it is Gluttony. And if it be love or plesaunce, or any manner of fleshly dalliance,
                                glosing or flattering of any man or woman living in this life, or of thyself either:
                                then it is Lechery.</p>
