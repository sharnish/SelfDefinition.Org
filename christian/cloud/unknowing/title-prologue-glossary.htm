                                GOD, unto whom all hearts be open, and unto whom all will speaketh, and unto whom
                                no privy thing is hid. I beseech Thee so for to cleanse the intent of mine heart
                                with the unspeakable gift of Thy grace, that I may perfectly love Thee, and worthily
                                praise Thee. Amen.</p>

                                IN the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost! I charge thee and
                                I beseech thee, with as much power and virtue as the bond of charity is sufficient
                                to suffer, whatsoever thou be that this book shalt have in possession, either by
                                property, either by keeping, by bearing as messenger, or else by borrowing, that
                                in as much as in thee is by will and advisement, neither thou read it, nor write
                                it, nor speak it, nor yet suffer it be read, written, or spoken, of any or to any
                                but if it be of such one, or to such one, that hath by thy supposing in a true will
                                and by an whole intent purposed him to be a perfect follower of Christ not only
                                in active living, but in the sovereignest point of contemplative living the which
                                is possible by grace for to be come to in this present life of a perfect soul yet
                                abiding in this deadly body; and thereto that doth that in him is, and by thy supposing
                                hath done long time before, for to able him to contemplative living by the virtuous
                                means of active living. For else it accor-deth nothing to him. And over this I charge
                                thee and I beseech thee by the authority of charity, that if any such shall read
                                it, write it, or speak it, or else hear it be read or spoken, that thou charge him
                                as I do thee, for to take him time to read it, speak it, write it, or hear it, all
                                over. For peradventure there is some matter therein in the beginning or in the middle,
                                the which is hanging, and not fully declared where it standeth: and if it be not
                                there, it is soon after, or else in the end. Wherefore if a man saw one matter and
                                not another, peradventure he might lightly be led into error; and therefore in eschewing
                                of this error, both in thyself and in all other, I pray thee for charity do as I
                                say thee.</p>
                            <p>
                                Fleshly janglers, open praisers and blamers of themselves or of any other, tellers
                                of trifles, ronners and tattlers of tales, and all manner of pinchers, cared I never
                                that they saw this book. For mine intent was never to write such thing unto them,
                                and therefore I would that they meddle not therewith; neither they, nor any of these
                                curious, lettered, or unlearned men. Yea, although that they be full good men of
                                active living, yet this matter accordeth nothing to them. But if it be to those
                                men, the which although they stand in activity by outward form of living, nevertheless
                                yet by inward stirring after the privy spirit of God, whose dooms be hid, they be
                                full graciously disposed, not continually as it is proper to very contemplatives,
                                but now and then to be perceivers in the highest point of this contemplative act;
                                if such men might see it, they should by the grace of God be greatly comforted thereby.</p>
                            <p>
                                This book is distinguished in seventy chapters and five. Of the which chapters,
                                the last chapter of all teacheth some certain tokens by the which a soul may verily
                                prove whether he be called of God to be a worker in this work or none.</p>
