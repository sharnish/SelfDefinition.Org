                                SOME there be, that although they be not deceived with this error as it is set here,
                                yet for pride and curiosity of natural wit and letterly cunning leave the common
                                doctrine and the counsel of Holy Church. And these with all their favourers lean
                                over much to their own knowing: and for they were never grounded in meek blind feeling
                                and virtuous living, therefore they merit to have a false feeling, feigned and wrought
                                by the ghostly enemy. Insomuch, that at the last they burst up and blaspheme all
                                the saints, sacraments, statutes, and ordinances of Holy Church. Fleshly living
                                men of the world, the which think the statutes of Holy Church over hard to be amended
                                by, they lean to these heretics full soon and full lightly, and stalwartly maintain
                                them, and all because them think that they lead them a softer way than is ordained
                                of Holy Church.</p>

                                shall go the soft way to hell. Each man prove by himself, for I trow that all such
                                heretics, and all their favourers, an they might clearly be seen as they shall on
                                the last day, should be seen full soon cumbered in great and horrible sins of the
                                world in their foul flesh, privily, without their open presumption in maintaining
                                of error: so that they be full properly called Antichrist's disciples. For it is
                                said of them, that for all their false fairness openly, yet they should be full
                                foul lechers privily.</p>

                                presumptuous ghostly disciples misunderstand this other word <em>up.</em></p>
                            <p>
                                For if it so be, that they either read, or hear read or spoken, how that men should
                                lift up their hearts unto God, as fast they stare in the stars as if they would
                                be above the moon, and hearken when they shall hear any angel sing out of heaven.
                                These men will sometime with the curiosity of their imagination pierce the planets,
                                and make an hole in the firmament to look in thereat. These men will make a God
                                as them list, and clothe Him full richly in clothes, and set Him in a throne far
                                more curiously than ever was He depicted in this earth. These men will make angels
                                in bodily likeness, and set them about each one with diverse minstrelsy, far more
                                curious than ever was any seen or heard in this life. Some of these men the devil
                                will deceive full wonderfully. For he will send a manner of dew, angels' food they
                                ween it be, as it were coming out of the air, and softly and sweetly falling in
                                their mouths; and therefore they have it in custom to sit gaping as they would catch
                                flies. Now truly all this is but deceit, seem it never so holy; for they have in
                                this time full empty souls of any true devotion. Much vanity and falsehood is in
                                their hearts, caused of their curious working. Insomuch, that ofttimes the devil
                                feigneth quaint sounds in their ears, quaint lights and shining in their eyes, and
                                wonderful smells in their noses: and all is but falsehood. And yet ween they not
                                so, for them think that they have ensample of Saint Martin of this upward looking
                                and working, that saw by revelation God clad in his mantle amongst His angels, and
                                of Saint Stephen that saw our Lord stand in heaven, and of many other; and of Christ,
                                that ascended bodily to heaven, seen of His disciples. And therefore they say that
                                we should have our eyes up thither. I grant well that in our bodily observance we
                                should lift up our eyes and our hands if we be stirred in spirit. But I say that
                                the work of our spirit shall not be direct neither upwards nor downwards, nor on
                                one side nor on other, nor forward nor backward, as it is of a bodily thing. For
                                why, our work should be ghostly not bodily, nor on a bodily manner wrought.</p>

                                    strain his imagination bodily upwards in the time of his prayer.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                FOR that that they say of Saint Martin and of Saint Stephen, although they saw such
                                things with their bodily eyes, it was shewed but in miracle and in certifying of
                                thing that was ghostly. For wit they right well that Saint Martin's mantle came
                                never on Christ's own body substantially, for no need that He had thereto to keep
                                Him from cold: but by miracle and in likeness for all us that be able to be saved,
                                that be oned to the body of Christ ghostly. And whoso clotheth a poor man and doth
                                any other good deed for God's love bodily or ghostly to any that hath need, sure
                                be they they do it unto Christ ghostly: and they shall be rewarded as substantially
                                therefore as they had done it to Christ's own body. Thus saith Himself in the gospel.
                                And yet thought He it not enough, but if He affirmed it after by miracle; and for
                                this cause He shewed Him unto Saint Martin by revelation. All the revelations that
                                ever saw any man here in bodily likeness in this life, they have ghostly bemeanings.
                                And I trow that if they unto whom they were shewed had been so ghostly, or could
                                have conceived their be-meanings ghostly, that then they had never been shewed bodily.
                                And therefore let us pick off the rough bark, and feed us off the sweet kernel.</p>
                            <p>
                                But how? Not as these heretics do, the which be well likened to madmen having this
                                custom, that ever when they have drunken of a fair cup, cast it to the wall and
                                break it. Thus should not we do if we will well do. For we should not so feed us
                                of the fruit, that we should despise the tree; nor so drink, that we should break
                                the cup when we have drunken. The tree and the cup I call this visible miracle,
                                and all seemly bodily observances, that is according and not letting the work of
                                the spirit. The fruit and the drink I call the ghostly bemeaning of these visible
                                miracles, and of these seemly bodily observances: as is lifting up of our eyes and
                                our hands unto heaven. If they be done by stirring of the spirit, then be they well
                                done; and else be they hypocrisy, and then be they false. If they be true and contain
                                in them ghostly fruit, why should they then be despised? For men will kiss the cup
                                for wine is therein.</p>
                            <p>
                                And what thereof, though our Lord when He ascended to heaven bodily took His way
                                upwards into the clouds, seen of His mother and His disciples with their bodily
                                eyes? Should we therefore in our ghostly work ever stare upwards with our bodily
                                eyes, to look after Him if we may see Him sit bodily in heaven, or else stand, as
                                Saint Stephen did? Nay, surely He shewed Him not unto Saint Stephen bodily in heaven,
                                because that He would give us ensample that we should in our ghostly work look bodily
                                up into heaven if we might see Him as Saint Stephen did, either standing, or sitting, or else lying. For howso
                                His body is in heaven—standing, sitting, or lying—wots no man. And it needeth not
                                more to be witted, but that His body is oned with the soul, without departing.</p>
                            <p> The body and the soul, the which is the manhood, is oned with the Godhead without departing
                                also. Of His sitting, His standing, His lying, needeth it not to wit; but that He
                                is there as Him list, and hath Him in body as most seemly is unto Him for to be.
                                For if He shew Him lying, or standing, or sitting, by revelation bodily to any creature
                                in this life, it is done for some ghostly bemeaning: and not for no manner of bodily
                                bearing that He hath in heaven. See by ensample. By standing is understood a readiness
                                of helping. And therefore it is said commonly of one friend to another, when he
                                is in bodily battle: &quot;Bear thee well, fellow, and fight fast, and give not
                                up the battle over lightly; for I shall stand by thee.&quot; He meaneth not only
                                bodily standing; for peradventure this battle is on horse and not on foot, and peradventure
                                it is in going and not standing. But he meaneth when he saith that he shall stand
                                by him, that he shall be ready to help him. For this reason it was that our Lord
                                shewed Him bodily in heaven to Saint Stephen, when he was in his martyrdom: and
                                not to give us ensample to look up to heaven. As He had said thus to Saint Stephen
                                in person of all those that suffer persecution for His love: &quot;Lo, Stephen!
                                as verily as I open this bodily firmament, the which is called heaven, and let thee
                                see My bodily standing, trust fast that as verily stand I beside thee ghostly by
                                the might of My Godhead. And I am ready to help thee, and therefore stand thou stiffly
                                in the faith and suffer boldly the fell buffets of those hard stones: for I shall
                                crown thee in bliss for thy meed, and not only thee, but all those that suffer persecution
                                for Me on any manner.&quot; And thus mayest thou see that these bodily shewings
                                were done by ghostly bemeanings.</p>

                                    body, these three should be forgotten in all ghostly working.</em>

                                AND if thou say aught touching the ascension of our Lord, for that was done bodily,
                                and for a bodily bemeaning as well as for a ghostly, for both He ascended very God
                                and very man: to this will I answer thee, that He had been dead, and was clad with
                                undeadliness, and so shall we be at the Day of Doom. And then we shall be made so
                                subtle in body and in soul together, that we shall be then as swiftly where us list
                                bodily as we be now in our thought ghostly; whether it be up or down, on one side
                                or on other, behind or before, all I hope shall then be alike good, as clerks say.
                                But now thou mayest not come to heaven bodily, but ghostly. And yet it shall be
                                so ghostly, that it shall not be on bodily manner; neither upwards nor downwards,
                                nor on one side nor on other, behind nor before.</p>
                            <p>
                                And wit well that all those that set them to be ghostly workers, and specially in
                                the work of this book, that although they read &quot;lift up&quot; or &quot;go in,&quot;
                                although all that the work of this book be called a stirring, nevertheless yet them
                                behoveth to have a full busy beholding, that this stirring stretch neither up bodily,
                                nor in bodily, nor yet that it be any such stirring as is from one place to another.
                                And although that it be sometime called a rest, nevertheless yet they shall not
                                think that it is any such rest as is any abiding in a place without removing therefrom.
                                For the perfection of this work is so pure and so ghostly in itself, that an it
                                be well and truly conceived, it shall be seen far removed from any stirring and
                                from any place.</p>
                            <p>
                                And it should by some reason rather be called a sudden changing, than any stirring
                                of place. For time, place, and body: these three should be forgotten in all ghostly
                                working. And therefore be wary in this work, that thou take none ensample at the
                                bodily ascension of Christ for to strain thine imagination in the time of thy prayer
                                bodily upwards, as thou wouldest climb above the moon. For it should on nowise be
                                so, ghostly. But if thou shouldest ascend into heaven bodily, as Christ did, then
                                thou mightest take ensample at it: but that may none do but God, as Himself witnesseth,
                                saying: &quot;There is no man that may ascend unto heaven but only He that descended
                                from heaven, and became man for the love of man.&quot; And if it were possible,
                                as it on nowise may be, yet it should be for abundance of ghostly working only by
                                the might of the spirit, full far from any bodily stressing or straining of our
                                imagination bodily, either up, or in, on one side, or on other. And therefore let
                                be such falsehood: it should not be so.</p>

                                    feet.</em>

                                BUT now peradventure thou sayest, that how should it then be? For thee thinkest
                                that thou hast very evidence that heaven is upwards; for Christ ascended the air
                                bodily upwards, and sent the Holy Ghost as He promised coming from above bodily,
                                seen of all His disciples; and this is our belief. And therefore thee thinkest since
                                thou hast thus very evidence, why shalt thou not direct thy mind upward bodily in
                                the time of thy prayer?</p>
                            <p>
                                And to this will I answer thee so feebly as I can, and say: since it so was, that
                                Christ should ascend bodily and thereafter send the Holy Ghost bodily, then it was
                                more seemly that it was upwards and from above than either downwards and from beneath,
                                behind, or before, on one side or on other. But else than for this seemliness, Him
                                needed never the more to have went upwards than downwards; I mean for nearness of
                                the way. For heaven ghostly is as nigh down as up, and up as down: behind as before,
                                before as behind, on one side as other. Insomuch, that whoso had a true desire for
                                to be at heaven, then that same time he were in heaven ghostly. For the high and
                                the next way thither is run by desires, and not by paces of feet. And therefore
                                saith Saint Paul of himself and many other thus; although our bodies be presently
                                here in earth, nevertheless yet our living is in heaven. He meant their love and
                                their desire, the which is ghostly their life. And surely as verily is a soul there
                                where it loveth, as in the body that Doeth by it and to the which it giveth life.
                                And therefore if we will go to heaven ghostly, it needeth not to strain our spirit
                                neither up nor down, nor on one side nor on other.</p>
