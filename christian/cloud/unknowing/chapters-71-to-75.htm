                                <em>That some may not come to feel the perfection of this work but in time of ravishing,
                                    and some may have it when they will, in the common state of man's soul.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SOME think this matter so hard and so fearful, that they say it may not be come
                                to without much strong travail coming before, nor conceived but seldom, and that
                                but in the time of ravishing. And to these men will I answer as feebly as I can,
                                and say, that it is all at the ordinance and the disposition of God, after their
                                ableness in soul that this grace of contemplation and of ghostly working is given
                                to.</p>
                            <p>
                                For some there be that without much and long ghostly exercise may not come thereto,
                                and yet it shall be but full seldom, and in special calling of our Lord that they
                                shall feel the perfection of this work: the which calling is called ravishing. And
                                some there be that be so subtle in grace and in spirit, and so homely with God in
                                this grace of contemplation, that they may have it when they will in the common
                                state of man's soul: as it is in sitting, going, standing, or kneeling. And yet
                                in this time they have full deliberation of all their wits bodily or ghostly, and
                                may use them if they desire: not without some letting (but without great letting).
                                Ensample of the first we have by Moses, and of this other by Aaron the priest of
                                the Temple: for why, this grace of contemplation is figured by the Ark of the Testament
                                in the old law, and the workers in this grace be figured by them that most meddled
                                them about this Ark, as the story will witness. And well is this grace and this
                                work likened unto that Ark. For right as in that Ark were contained all the jewels
                                and the relics of the Temple, right so in this little love put upon this cloud be
                                contained all the virtues of man's soul, the which is the ghostly Temple of God.</p>
                            <p>
                                Moses ere he might come to see this Ark and for to wit how it should be made, with
                                great long travail he clomb up to the top of the mountain, and dwelled there, and
                                wrought in a cloud six days: abiding unto the seventh day that our Lord would vouchsafe
                                for to shew unto him the manner of this Ark-making. By Moses's long travail and
                                his late shewing, be understood those that may not come to the perfection of this
                                ghostly work without long travail coming before: and yet but full seldom, and when
                                God will vouchsafe to shew it.</p>
                            <p>
                                But that that Moses might not come to see but seldom, and that not without great
                                long travail, Aaron had in his power because of his office, for to see it in the
                                Temple within the Veil as oft as him liked for to enter. And by this Aaron is understood
                                all those the which I spake of above, the which by their ghostly cunning, by help
                                of grace, may assign unto them the perfection of this work as them liketh.</p>

                                THREE men there were that most principally meddled them with this Ark of the Old
                                Testament: Moses, Bezaleel, Aaron. Moses learned in the mount of our Lord how it
                                should be made. Bezaleel wrought it and made it in the Veil after the ensample that
                                was shewed in the mountain. And Aaron had it in keeping in the Temple, to feel it
                                and see it as oft as him liked.</p>
                            <p>
                                At the likeness of these three, we profit on three manners in this grace of contemplation.
                                Sometime we profit only by grace, and then we be likened unto Moses, that for all
                                the climbing and the travail that he had into the mount might not come to see it
                                but seldom: and yet was that sight only by the shewing of our Lord when Him liked
                                to shew it, and not for any desert of his travail. Sometime we profit in this grace
                                by our own ghostly cunning, helped with grace, and then be we likened to Bezaleel,
                                the which might not see the Ark ere the time that he had made it by his own travail,
                                helped with the ensample that was shewed unto Moses in the mount. And sometime we
                                profit in this grace by other men's teaching, and then be we likened to Aaron, the
                                which had it in keeping and in custom to see and feel the Ark when him pleased,
                                that Bezaleel had wrought and made ready before to his hands.</p>
                            <p>
                                Lo! ghostly friend, in this work, though it be childishly and lewdly spoken, I bear,
                                though I be a wretch unworthy to teach any creature, the office of Bezaleel: making
                                and declaring in manner to thine hands the manner of this ghostly Ark. But far better
                                and more worthily than I do, thou mayest work if thou wilt be Aaron: that is to
                                say, continually working therein for thee and for me. Do then so I pray thee, for
                                the love of God Almighty. And since we be both called of God to work in this work,
                                I beseech thee for God's love fulfil in thy part what lacketh of mine.</p>

                                    spoken, of a soul disposed thereto without feeling of a very accordance to the effect
                                    of the same work: and of rehearsing of the same charge that is written in the prologue.</em>

                            <p>
                                AND if thee think that this manner of working be not according to thy disposition
                                in body and in soul, thou mayest leave it and take another, safely with good ghostly
                                counsel without blame. And then I beseech thee that thou wilt have me excused, for
                                truly I would have profited unto thee in this writing at my simple cunning; and
                                that was mine intent. And therefore read over twice or thrice; and ever the ofter
                                the better, and the more thou shalt conceive thereof. Insomuch, peradventure, that
                                some sentence that was full hard to thee at the first or the second reading, soon
                                after thou shalt think it easy.</p>
                            <p>
                                Yea! and it seemeth impossible to mine understanding, that any soul that is disposed
                                to this work should read it or speak it, or else hear it read or spoken, but if
                                that same soul should feel for that time a very accordance to the effect of this
                                work. And then if thee think it doth thee good, thank God heartily, and for God's
                                love pray for me.</p>
                            <p>
                                Do then so. And I pray thee for God's love that thou let none see this book, unless
                                it be such one that thee think is like to the book; after that thou findest written
                                in the book before, where it telleth what men and when they should work in this
                                work. And if thou shalt let any such men see it, then I pray thee that thou bid
                                them take them time to look it all over. For peradventure there is some matter therein
                                in the beginning, or in the midst, the which is hanging and not fully declared there
                                as it standeth. But if it be not there, it is soon after, or else in the end. And
                                thus if a man saw one part and not another, peradventure he should lightly be led
                                into error: and therefore I pray thee to work as I say thee. And if thee think that
                                there be any matter therein that thou wouldest have more opened than it is, let
                                me wit which it is, and thy conceit thereupon; and at my simple cunning it shall
                                be amended if I can.</p>
                            <p>
                                Fleshly janglers, flatterers and blamers, ronkers and ronners, and all manner of
                                pinchers, cared I never that they saw this book: for mine intent was never to write
                                such thing to them. And therefore I would not that they heard it, neither they nor
                                none of these curious lettered nor unlearned men: yea! although they be full good
                                men in active living, for it ac-cordeth not to them.</p>

                                <em>Of some certain tokens by the which a man may prove whether he be called of God
                                    to work in this work.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                ALL those that read or hear the matter of this book be read or spoken, and in this
                                reading or hearing think it a good and liking thing, be never the rather called
                                of God to work in this work, only for this liking stirring that they feel in the
                                time of this reading. For peradventure this stirring cometh more of a natural curiosity
                                of wit, than of any calling of grace.</p>
                            <p>
                                But, if they will prove whence this stirring cometh, they may prove thus, if them
                                liketh. First let them look if they have done that in them is before, abling them
                                thereto in cleansing of their conscience at the doom of Holy Church, their counsel
                                according. If it be thus, it is well inasmuch: but if they will wit more near, let
                                them look if it be evermore pressing in their remembrance more customably than is
                                any other of ghostly exercise. And if them think that there is no manner of thing
                                that they do, bodily or ghostly, that is sufficiently done with witness of their
                                conscience, unless this privy little love pressed be in manner ghostly the chief
                                of all their work: and if they thus feel, then it is a token that they be called
                                of God to this work, and surely else not.</p>
                            <p>
                                I say not that it shall ever last and dwell in all their minds continually, that
                                be called to work in this work. Nay, so is it not. For from a young ghostly prentice
                                in this work, the actual feeling thereof is ofttimes withdrawn for divers reasons.
                                Sometime, for he shall not take over presumptuously thereupon, and ween that it
                                be in great part in his own power to have it when him list, and as him list. And
                                such a weening were pride. And evermore when the feeling of grace is withdrawn,
                                pride is the cause: not ever pride that is, but pride that should be, were it not
                                that this feeling of grace were withdrawn. And thus ween ofttimes some young fools,
                                that God is their enemy; when He is their full friend.</p>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes it is withdrawn for their carelessness; and when it is thus, they feel
                                soon after a full bitter pain that beateth them full sore. Sometimes our Lord will
                                delay it by an artful device, for He will by such a delaying make it grow, and be
                                had more in dainty when it is new found and felt again that long had been lost.
                                And this is one of the readiest and sovereignest tokens that a soul may have to
                                wit by, whether he be called or not to work in this work, if he feel after such
                                a delaying and a long lacking of this work, that when it cometh suddenly as it doth,
                                unpurchased with any means, that he hath then a greater fervour of desire and greater
                                love longing to work in this work, than ever he had any before. Insomuch, that ofttimes
                                I trow, he hath more joy of the finding thereof than ever he had sorrow of the losing.</p>
                            <p>
                                And if it be thus, surely it is a very token without error, that he is called of
                                God to work in this work, whatsoever that he be or hath been.</p>
                            <p>
                                For not what thou art, nor what thou hast been, beholdeth God with His merciful
                                eyes; but that thou wouldest be. And Saint Gregory to witness, that all holy desires
                                grow by delays: and if they wane by delays, then were they never holy desires. For
                                he that feeleth ever less joy and less, in new findings and sudden presentations
                                of his old purposed desires, although they may be called natural desires to the
                                good, nevertheless holy desires were they never. Of this holy desire speaketh Saint
                                Austin and saith, that all the life of a good Christian man is nought else but holy
                                desire.</p>
                            <p>
                                Farewell, ghostly friend, in God's blessing and mine! And I beseech Almighty God,
                                that true peace, holy counsel, and ghostly comfort in God with abundance of grace,
                                evermore be with thee and all God's lovers in earth. Amen.</p>
