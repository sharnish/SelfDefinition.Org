                                to amend thee at the doom of Holy Church, then shalt thou set thee sharply to work
                                in this work. And then if it so be that thy foredone special deeds will always press
                                in thy remembrance betwixt thee and thy God, or any new thought or stirring of any

                                forgetting, as they never had been done in this life of thee nor of other man either.
                                And if they oft rise, oft put them down: and shortly to say, as oft as they rise,
                                as oft put them down. And if thee think that the travail be great, thou mayest seek

                                    book.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                NEVERTHELESS, somewhat of this subtlety shall I tell thee as me think. Prove thou
                                and do better, if thou better mayest. Do that in thee is, to let be as thou wist
                                not that they press so fast upon thee betwixt thee and thy God. And try to look
                                as it were over their shoulders, seeking another thing: the which thing is God,
                                enclosed in a cloud of unknowing. And if thou do thus, I trow that within short
                                time thou shalt be eased of thy travail. I trow that an this device be well and
                                truly conceived, it is nought else but a longing desire unto God, to feel Him and
                                see Him as it may be here: and such a desire is charity, and it obtaineth always
                                to be eased.</p>
                            <p>
                                Another device there is: prove thou if thou wilt. When thou feelest that thou mayest
                                on nowise put them down, cower thou down under them as a caitiff and a coward overcome
                                in battle, and think that it is but a folly to thee to strive any longer with them,
                                and therefore thou yieldest thee to God in the hands of thine enemies. And feel
                                then thyself as thou wert foredone for ever. Take good heed of this device I pray
                                thee, for me think in the proof of this device thou shouldest melt all to water.
                                And surely me think an this device be truly conceived it is nought else but a true
                                knowing and a feeling of thyself as thou art, a wretch and a filthy, far worse than
                                nought: the which knowing and feeling is meekness. And this meekness obtaineth to
                                have God Himself mightily descending, to venge thee of thine enemies, for to take
                                thee up, and cherishingly dry thine ghostly eyen; as the father doth the child that
                                is in point to perish under the mouths of wild swine or wode biting bears.</p>

                                thou mayest not soon win to these arts. For truly it is thy purgatory, and then
                                when thy pain is all passed and thy devices be given of God, and graciously gotten
                                in custom; then it is no doubt to me that thou art cleansed not only of sin, but
                                also of the pain of sin. I mean, of the pain of thy special foredone sins, and not
                                of the pain of the original sin. For that pain shall always last on thee to thy
                                death day, be thou never so busy. Nevertheless, it shall but little provoke thee,
                                in comparison of this pain of thy special sins; and yet shalt thou not be without
                                great travail. For out of this original sin will all day spring new and fresh stirrings
                                of sin: the which thee behoveth all day to smite down, and be busy to shear away
                                with a sharp double-edged dreadful sword of discretion. And hereby mayest thou see
                                and learn, that there is no soothfast security, nor yet no true rest in this life.</p>
                            <p>

                                For an it so be that thou mayest have grace to destroy the pain of thine foredone
                                special deeds, in the manner before said—or better if thou better mayest—sure be
                                thou, that the pain of the original sin, or else the new stirrings of sin that be

                                is the work of only God, specially wrought in what soul that Him liketh without
                                any desert of the same soul. For without it no saint nor no angel can think to desire
                                it. And I trow that our Lord as specially and as oft—yea! and more specially and
                                more oft—will vouchsafe to work this work in them that have been accustomed sinners,
                                than in some other, that never grieved Him greatly in comparison of them. And this
                                will He do, for He will be seen all-merciful and almighty; and for He will be seen
                                to work as Him list, where Him list, and when Him list.</p>
                            <p>
                                And yet He giveth not this grace, nor worketh not this work, in any soul that is
                                unable thereto. And yet, there is no soul without this grace, able to have this
                                grace: none, whether it be a sinner's soul or an innocent soul. For neither it is
                                given for innocence, nor withholden for sin. Take good heed, that I say withholden,
                                and not withdrawn. Beware of error here, I pray thee; for ever, the nearer men touch
                                the truth, more wary men behoveth to be of error. I mean but well: if thou canst
                                not conceive it, lay it by thy side till God come and teach thee. Do then so, and
                                hurt thee not.</p>
                            <p>
                                Beware of pride, for it blasphemeth God in His gifts, and boldeneth sinners. Wert
                                thou verily meek, thou shouldest feel of this work as I say: that God giveth it
                                freely without any desert. The condition of this work is such, that the presence
                                thereof enableth a soul for to have it and for to feel it. And that ableness may
                                no soul have without it. The ableness to this work is oned to the work's self without
                                departing; so that whoso feeleth this work is able thereto, and none else. Insomuch,
                                that without this work a soul is as it were dead, and cannot covet it nor desire
                                it. Forasmuch as thou willest it and desirest it, so much hast thou of it, and no
                                more nor no less: and yet is it no will, nor no desire, but a thing thou wottest
                                never what, that stirreth thee to will and desire thou wottest never what. Reck
                                thee never if thou wittest no more, I pray thee: but do forth ever more and more,
                                so that thou be ever doing.</p>
                            <p>
                                And if I shall shortlier say, let that thing do with thee and lead thee whereso
                                it list. Let it be the worker, and you but the sufferer: do but look upon it, and
                                let it alone. Meddle thee not therewith as thou wouldest help it, for dread lest
                                thou spill all. Be thou but the tree, and let it be the wright: be thou but the
                                house, and let it be the husbandman dwelling therein.</p>
                            <p>
                                Be blind in this time, and shear away covetise of knowing, for it will more let
                                thee than help thee. It sufficeth enough unto thee, that thou feelest thee stirred
                                likingly with a thing thou wottest never what, else that in this stirring thou hast
                                no special thought of any thing under God; and that thine intent be nakedly directed
                                unto God.</p>
                            <p>
                                And if it be thus, trust then steadfastly that it is only God that stirreth thy
                                will and thy desire plainly by Himself, without means either on His part or on thine.
                                And be not feared, for the devil may not come so near. He may never come to stir
                                a man's will, but occasionally and by means from afar, be he never so subtle a devil.
                                For sufficiently and without means may no good angel stir thy will: nor, shortly
                                to say, nothing but only God. So that thou mayest conceive here by these words somewhat
                                (but much more clearly by the proof), that in this work men shall use no means:
                                nor yet men may not come thereto with means. All good means hang upon it, and it
                                on no means; nor no means may lead thereto.</p>

                                <em>Of three means in the which a contemplative Prentice should be occupied, in reading,
                                    thinking, and praying.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                NEVERTHELESS, means there be in the which a contemplative prentice should be occupied,
                                the which be these—Lesson, Meditation, and Orison: or else to thine understanding
                                they may be called—Reading, Thinking, and Praying. Of these three thou shalt find
                                written in another book of another man's work, much better than I can tell thee;
                                and therefore it nee-deth not here to tell thee of the qualities of them. But this
                                may I tell thee: these three be so coupled together, that unto them that be beginners
                                and profiters—but not to them that be perfect, yea, as it may be here—thinking may
                                not goodly be gotten, without reading or hearing coming before. All is one in manner,
                                reading and hearing: clerks reading on books, and lewd men reading on clerks when
                                they hear them preach the word of God. Nor prayer may not goodly be gotten in beginners
                                and profiters, without thinking coming before.</p>
                            <p>
                                See by the proof. In this same course, God's word either written or spoken is likened
                                to a mirror. Ghostly, the eyes of thy soul is thy reason; thy conscience is thy
                                visage ghostly. And right as thou seest that if a foul spot be in thy bodily visage,
                                the eyes of the same visage may not see that spot nor wit where it is, without a
                                mirror or a teaching of another than itself; right so it is ghostly, without reading
                                or hearing of God's word it is impossible to man's understanding that a soul that
                                is blinded in custom of sin should see the foul spot in his conscience.</p>
                            <p>
                                And so following, when a man seeth in a bodily or ghostly mirror, or wots by other
                                men's teaching, whereabouts the foul spot is on his visage, either bodily or ghostly;
                                then at first, and not before, he runneth to the well to wash him. If this spot
                                be any special sin, then is this well Holy Church, and this water confession, with
                                the circumstances. If it be but a blind root and a stirring of sin, then is this
                                well merciful God, and this water prayer, with the circumstances. And thus mayest
                                thou see that no thinking may goodly be gotten in beginners and profiters, without
                                reading or hearing coming before: nor praying without thinking.</p>
