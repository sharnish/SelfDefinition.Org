                                <em>That in all other works beneath this, men should keep discretion; but in this none.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AND furthermore, if thou ask me what discretion thou shalt have in this work, then
                                I answer thee and say, right none! For in all thine other doings thou shalt have
                                discretion, as in eating and in drinking, and in sleeping and in keeping of thy
                                body from outrageous cold or heat, and in long praying or reading, or in communing
                                in speech with thine even-christian. In all these shalt thou keep discretion, that
                                they be neither too much nor too little. But in this work shalt thou hold no measure:
                                for I would that thou shouldest never cease of this work the whiles thou livest.</p>
                            <p>
                                I say not that thou shalt continue ever therein alike fresh, for that may not be.
                                For sometime sickness and other unordained dispositions in body and in soul, with
                                many other needfulness to nature, will let thee full much, and ofttimes draw thee
                                down from the height of this working. But I say that thou shouldest evermore have
                                it either in earnest or in game; that is to say, either in work or in will. And
                                therefore for God's love be wary with sickness as much as thou mayest goodly, so
                                that thou be not the cause of thy feebleness, as far as thou mayest. For I tell
                                thee truly, that this work asketh a full great restfulness, and a full whole and
                                clean disposition, as well in body as in soul.</p>
                            <p>
                                And therefore for God's love govern thee discreetly in body and in soul, and get
                                thee thine health as much as thou mayest. And if sickness come against thy power,
                                have patience and abide meekly God's mercy: and all is then good enough. For I tell
                                thee truly, that ofttimes patience in sickness and in other diverse tribulations
                                pleaseth God much more than any liking devotion that thou mayest have in thy health.</p>

                                BUT peradventure thou askest me, how thou shalt govern thee discreetly in meat and
                                in sleep, and in all these other. And hereto I think to answer thee right shortly:
                                &quot;Get that thou get mayest.&quot; Do this work evermore without ceasing and
                                without discretion, and thou shalt well ken begin and cease in all other works with
                                a great discretion. For I may not trow that a soul continuing in this work night
                                and day without discretion, should err in any of these outward doings; and else,
                                me think that he should always err.</p>
                            <p>
                                And therefore, an I might get a waking and a busy beholding to this ghostly work
                                within in my soul, I would then have a heedlessness in eating and in drinking, in
                                sleeping and in speaking, and in all mine outward doings. For surely I trow I should
                                rather come to discretion in them by such a heedlessness, than by any busy beholding
                                to the same things, as I would by that beholding set a mark and a measure by them.
                                Truly I should never bring it so about, for ought that I could do or say. Say what
                                men say will, and let the proof witness. And therefore lift up thine heart with
                                a blind stirring of love; and mean now sin, and now God. God wouldest thou have,
                                and sin wouldest thou lack. God wanteth thee; and sin art thou sure of. Now good
                                God help thee, for now hast thou need!</p>

                                cloud of forgetting. And thou shalt understand, that thou shalt not only in this
                                work forget all other creatures than thyself, or their deeds or thine, but also
                                thou shalt in this work forget both thyself and also thy deeds for God, as well
                                as all other creatures and their deeds. For it is the condition of a perfect lover,
                                not only to love that thing that he loveth more than himself; but also in a manner
                                for to hate himself for that thing that he loveth.</p>
                            <p>
                                Thus shalt thou do with thyself: thou shalt loathe and be weary with all that thing
                                that worketh in thy wit and in thy will unless it be only God. For why, surely else,
                                whatsoever that it be, it is betwixt thee and thy God. And no wonder though thou
                                loathe and hate for to think on thyself, when thou shalt always feel sin, a foul
                                stinking lump thou wottest never what, betwixt thee and thy God: the which lump
                                is none other thing than thyself. For thou shalt think it oned and congealed with
                                the substance of thy being: yea, as it were without departing.</p>
                            <p>
                                And therefore break down all witting and feeling of all manner of creatures; but
                                most busily of thyself. For on the witting and the feeling of thyself hangeth witting
                                and feeling of all other creatures; for in regard of it, all other creatures be
                                lightly forgotten. For, an thou wilt busily set thee to the proof, thou shalt find
                                when thou hast forgotten all other creatures and all their works—yea, and thereto
                                all thine own works—that there shall live yet after, betwixt thee and thy God, a
                                naked witting and a feeling of thine own being: the which witting and feeling behoveth

                                of God, and thereto a full according ableness to receive this grace on thy part,
                                this naked witting and feeling of thy being may on nowise be destroyed. And this
                                ableness is nought else but a strong and a deep ghostly sorrow.</p>
                            <p>
                                But in this sorrow needeth thee to have discretion, on this manner: thou shalt be
                                wary in the time of this sorrow, that thou neither too rudely strain thy body nor
                                thy spirit, but sit full still, as it were in a sleeping device, all forsobbed and
                                forsunken in sorrow. This is true sorrow; this is perfect sorrow; and well were
                                him that might win to this sorrow. All men have matter of sorrow: but most specially
                                he feeleth matter of sorrow, that wotteth and feeleth that he is. All other sorrows
                                be unto this in comparison but as it were game to earnest. For he may make sorrow
                                earnestly, that wotteth and feeleth not only what he is, but that he is. And whoso
                                felt never this sorrow, he may make sorrow: for why, he felt yet never perfect sorrow.
                                This sorrow, when it is had, cleanseth the soul, not only of sin, but also of pain
                                that it hath deserved for sin; and thereto it maketh a soul able to receive that
                                joy, the which reeveth from a man all witting and feeling of his being.</p>
                            <p>
                                This sorrow, if it be truly conceived, is full of holy desire: and else might never
                                man in this life abide it nor bear it. For were it not that a soul were somewhat
                                fed with a manner of comfort of his right working, else should he not be able to
                                bear the pain that he hath of the witting and feeling of his being. For as oft as
                                he would have a true witting and a feeling of his God in purity of spirit, as it
                                may be here, and sithen feeleth that he may not—for he findeth evermore his witting
                                and his feeling as it were occupied and filled with a foul stinking lump of himself,
                                the which behoveth always be hated and be despised and forsaken, if he shall be
                                God's perfect disciple learned of Himself in the mount of perfection—so oft, he
                                goeth nigh mad for sorrow. Insomuch, that he weepeth and waileth, striveth, curseth,
                                and banneth; and shortly to say, him thinketh that he beareth so heavy a burthen
                                of himself that he careth never what betides him, so that God were pleased. And
                                yet in all this sorrow he desireth not to unbe: for that were devil's madness and
                                despite unto God. But him listeth right well to be; and he intendeth full heartily
                                thanking to God, for the worthiness and the gift of his being, for all that he desire
                                unceasingly for to lack the witting and the feeling of his being.</p>
                            <p>
                                This sorrow and this desire behoveth every soul have and feel in itself, either
                                in this manner or in another; as God vouchsafeth for to learn to His ghostly disciples
                                after His well willing and their according ableness in body and in soul, in degree
                                and disposition, ere the time be that they may perfectly be oned unto God in perfect
                                charity—such as may be had here—if God vouchsafeth.</p>

                                <em>A good declaring of some certain deceits that may befall in this work.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                BUT one thing I tell thee, that in this work may a young disciple that hath not
                                yet been well used and proved in ghostly working, full lightly be deceived; and,
                                but he be soon wary, and have grace to leave off and meek him to counsel, peradventure
                                be destroyed in his bodily powers and fall into fantasy in his ghostly wits. And
                                all this is along of pride, and of fleshliness and curiosity of wit.</p>
                            <p>
                                And on this manner may this deceit befall. A young man or a woman new set to the
                                school of devotion heareth this sorrow and this desire be read and spoken: how that
                                a man shall lift up his heart unto God, and unceasingly desire for to feel the love
                                of his God. And as fast in a curiosity of wit they conceive these words not ghostly
                                as they be meant, but fleshly and bodily; and travail their fleshly hearts outrageously
                                in their breasts. And what for lacking of grace and pride and curiosity in themselves,
                                they strain their veins and their bodily powers so beastly and so rudely, that within
                                short time they fall either into frenzies, weariness, and a manner of unlisty feebleness
                                in body and in soul, the which maketh them to wend out of themselves and seek some
                                false and some vain fleshly and bodily comfort without, as it were for recreation
                                of body and of spirit: or else, if they fall not in this, else they merit for ghostly
                                blindness, and for fleshly chafing of their nature in their bodily breasts in the
                                time of this feigned beastly and not ghostly working, for to have their breasts
                                either enflamed with an unkindly heat of nature caused of misruling of their bodies
                                or of this feigned working, or else they conceive a false heat wrought by the Fiend,
                                their ghostly enemy, caused of their pride and of their fleshliness and their curiosity
                                of wit. And yet peradventure they ween it be the fire of love, gotten and kindled
                                by the grace and the goodness of the Holy Ghost. Truly, of this deceit, and of the
                                branches thereof, spring many mischiefs: much hypocrisy, much heresy, and much error.
                                For as fast after such a false feeling cometh a false knowing in the Fiend's school,
                                right as after a true feeling cometh a true knowing in God's school. For I tell
                                thee truly, that the devil hath his contemplatives as God hath His.</p>
                            <p>
                                This deceit of false feeling, and of false knowing following thereon, hath diverse
                                and wonderful variations, after the diversity of states and the subtle conditions
                                of them that be deceived: as hath the true feeling and knowing of them that be saved.
                                But I set no more deceits here but those with the which I trow thou shalt be assailed
                                if ever thou purpose thee to work in this work. For what should it profit to thee
                                to wit how these great clerks, and men and women of other degrees than thou art,
                                be deceived? Surely right nought; and therefore I tell thee no more but those that
                                fall unto thee if thou travail in this work. And therefore I tell thee this, for
                                thou shalt be wary therewith in thy working, if thou be assailed therewith.</p>
