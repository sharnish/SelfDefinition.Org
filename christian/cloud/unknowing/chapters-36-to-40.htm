                            </p>
                            <p>
                                BUT it is not so with them that continually work in the work of this book. For their
                                meditations be but as they were sudden conceits and blind feelings of their own
                                wretchedness, or of the goodness of God; without any means of reading or hearing
                                coming before, and without any special beholding of any thing under God. These sudden
                                conceits and these blind feelings be sooner learned of God than of man. I care not
                                though thou haddest nowadays none other meditations of thine own wretchedness, nor
                                of the goodness of God (I mean if thou feel thee thus stirred by grace and by counsel),
                                but such as thou mayest have in this word SIN, and in this word GOD: or in such
                                other, which as thee list. Not breaking nor expounding these words with curiosity
                                of wit, in beholding after the qualities of these words, as thou wouldest by that
                                beholding increase thy devotion. I trow it should never be so in this case and in
                                this work. But hold them all whole these words; and mean by sin, a <em>lump,</em>
                                thou wottest never what, none other thing but thyself. Me think that in this blind
                                beholding of sin, thus congealed in a lump, none other thing than thyself, it should
                                be no need to bind a madder thing, than thou shouldest be in this time. And yet
                                peradventure, whoso looked upon thee should think thee full soberly disposed in
                                thy body, without any changing of countenance; but sitting or going or lying, or
                                leaning or standing or kneeling, whether thou wert, in a full sober restfulness.</p>

                                this work rise suddenly without any means, right so do their prayers. I mean of
                                their special prayers, not of those prayers that be ordained of Holy Church. For
                                they that be true workers in this work, they worship no prayer so much: and therefore
                                they do them, in the form and in the statute that they be ordained of holy fathers
                                before us. But their special prayers rise evermore suddenly unto God, without any
                                means or any premeditation in special coming before, or going therewith.</p>
                            <p>
                                And if they be in words, as they be but seldom, then be they but in full few words:
                                yea, and in ever the fewer the better. Yea, and if it be but a little word of one
                                syllable, me think it better than of two: and more, too, according to the work of
                                the spirit, since it so is that a ghostly worker in this work should evermore be
                                in the highest and the sovereignest point of the spirit. That this be sooth, see
                                by ensample in the course of nature. A man or a woman, afraid with any sudden chance
                                of fire or of man's death or what else that it be, suddenly in the height of his
                                spirit, he is driven upon haste and upon need for to cry or for to pray after help.
                                Yea, how? Surely, not in many words, nor yet in one word of two syllables. And why
                                is that? For him thinketh it over long tarrying for to declare the need and the
                                work of his spirit. And therefore he bursteth up hideously with a great spirit,
                                and cryeth a little word, but of one syllable: as is this word &quot;fire,&quot;
                                or this word &quot;out!&quot;</p>
                            <p>
                                And right as this little word &quot;fire&quot; stirreth rather and pierceth more
                                hastily the ears of the hearers, so doth a little word of one syllable when it is
                                not only spoken or thought, but privily meant in the deepness of spirit; the which
                                is the height, for in ghostliness all is one, height and deepness, length and breadth.
                                And rather it pierceth the ears of Almighty God than doth any long psalter unmindfully
                                mumbled in the teeth. And herefore it is written, that short prayer pierceth heaven.</p>

                                AND why pierceth it heaven, this little short prayer of one little syllable? Surely
                                because it is prayed with a full spirit, in the height and in the deepness, in the
                                length and in the breadth of his spirit that prayeth it. In the height it is, for
                                it is with all the might of the spirit. In the deepness it is, for in this little
                                syllable be contained all the wits of the spirit. In the length it is, for might
                                it ever feel as it feeleth, ever would it cry as it cryeth. In the breadth it is,
                                for it willeth the same to all other that it willeth to itself.</p>
                            <p>
                                In this time it is that a soul hath comprehended after the lesson of Saint Paul
                                with all saints—not fully, but in manner and in part, as it is according unto this
                                work—which is the length and the breadth, the height and the deepness of everlasting
                                and all-lovely, almighty, and all-witting God. The everlastingness of God is His
                                length. His love is His breadth. His might is His height. And His wisdom is His
                                deepness. No wonder though a soul that is thus nigh conformed by grace to the image
                                and the likeness of God his maker, be soon heard of God! Yea, though it be a full
                                sinful soul, the which is to God as it were an enemy; an he might through grace
                                come for to cry such a little syllable in the height and the deepness, the length
                                and the breadth of his spirit, yet he should for the hideous noise of his cry be
                                always heard and helped of God.</p>
                            <p>
                                See by ensample. He that is thy deadly enemy, an thou hear him so afraid that he
                                cry in the height of his spirit this little word &quot;fire,&quot; or this word
                                &quot;out&quot;; yet without any beholding to him for he is thine enemy, but for
                                pure pity in thine heart stirred and raised with the dolefulness of this cry, thou
                                risest up—yea, though it be about midwinter's night—and helpest him to slack his
                                fire, or for to still him and rest him in his distress. Oh, Lord! since a man may
                                be made so merciful in grace, to have so much mercy and so much pity of his enemy,
                                notwithstanding his enmity, what pity and what mercy shall God have then of a ghostly
                                cry in soul, made and wrought in the height and the deepness, the length and the
                                breadth of his spirit; the which hath all by nature that man hath by grace? And
                                much more, surely without comparison, much more mercy will He have; since it is,
                                that that thing that is so had by nature is nearer to an eternal thing than that
                                which is had by grace.</p>

                                <em>How a perfect worker shall pray, and what prayer is in itself; and if a man shall
                                    pray in words, which words accord them most to the property of prayer.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AND therefore it is, to pray in the height and the deepness, the length and the
                                breadth of our spirit. And that not in many words, but in a little word of one syllable.</p>
                            <p>
                                And what shall this word be? Surely such a word as is best according unto the property
                                of prayer. And what word is that? Let us first see what prayer is properly in itself,
                                and thereafter we may clearlier know what word will best accord to the property
                                of prayer.</p>
                            <p>
                                Prayer in itself properly is not else, but a devout intent direct unto God, for
                                getting of good and removing of evil. And then, since it so is that all evil be
                                comprehended in sin, either by cause or by being, let us therefore when we will
                                intentively pray for removing of evil either say, or think, or mean, nought else
                                nor no more words, but this little word &quot;sin.&quot; And if we will intentively
                                pray for getting of good, let us cry, either with word or with thought or with desire,
                                nought else nor no more words, but this word &quot;God.&quot; For why, in God be
                                all good, both by cause and by being. Have no marvel why I set these words forby
                                all other. For if I could find any shorter words, so fully comprehending in them
                                all good and all evil, as these two words do, or if I had been learned of God to
                                take any other words either, I would then have taken them and left these; and so
                                I counsel that thou do.</p>
                            <p>
                                Study thou not for no words, for so shouldest thou never come to thy purpose nor
                                to this work, for it is never got by study, but all only by grace. And therefore
                                take thou none other words to pray in, although I set these here, but such as thou
                                art stirred of God for to take. Nevertheless, if God stir thee to take these, I
                                counsel not that thou leave them; I mean if thou shalt pray in words, and else not.
                                For why, they be full short words. But although the shortness of prayer be greatly
                                commended here, nevertheless the oftness of prayer is never the rather refrained.
                                For as it is said before, it is prayed in the length of the spirit; so that it should
                                never cease, till the time were that it had fully gotten that that it longed after.
                                Ensample of this have we in a man or a woman afraid in the manner beforesaid. For
                                we see well, that they cease never crying on this little word &quot;out,&quot; or
                                this little word &quot;fire,&quot; ere the time be that they have in great part
                                gotten help of their grief.</p>

                                <em>That in the time of this work a soul hath no special beholding to any vice in itself

                                DO thou, on the same manner, fill thy spirit with the ghostly bemeaning of this
                                word &quot;sin,&quot; and without any special beholding unto any kind of sin, whether
                                it be venial or deadly: Pride, Wrath, or Envy, Covetyse, Sloth, Gluttony, or Lechery.
                                What recks it in contemplatives, what sin that it be, or how muckle a sin that it
                                be? For all sins them thinketh—I mean for the time of this work—alike great in themselves,
                                when the least sin departeth them from God, and letteth them of their ghostly peace.</p>
                            <p>
                                And feel sin a lump, thou wottest never what, but none other thing than thyself.
                                And cry then ghostly ever upon one: a <em>Sin, sin, sin! Out, out, out!</em> This
                                ghostly cry is better learned of God by the proof, than of any man by word. For
                                it is best when it is in pure spirit, without special thought or any pronouncing
                                of word; unless it be any seldom time, when for abundance of spirit it bursteth
                                up into word, so that the body and the soul be both filled with sorrow and cumbering
                                of sin.</p>
                            <p>
                                On the same manner shalt thou do with this little word &quot;God.&quot; Fill thy
                                spirit with the ghostly bemeaning of it without any special beholding to any of
                                His works—whether they be good, better, or best of all—bodily or ghostly, or to
                                any virtue that may be wrought in man's soul by any grace; not looking after whether
                                it be meekness or charity, patience or abstinence, hope, faith, or soberness, chastity
                                or wilful poverty. What recks this in contem-platives? For all virtues they find
                                and feel in God; for in Him is all thing, both by cause and by being. For they think
                                that an they had God they had all good, and therefore they covet nothing with special
                                beholding, but only good God. Do thou on the same manner as far forth as thou mayest
                                by grace: and mean God all, and all God, so that nought work in thy wit and in thy
                                will, but only God.</p>
                            <p>
                                And because that ever the whiles thou livest in this wretched life, thee behoveth
                                always feel in some part this foul stinking lump of sin, as it were oned and congealed
                                with the substance of thy being, therefore shalt thou changeably mean these two
                                words—sin and God. With this general knowing, that an thou haddest God, then shouldest
                                thou lack sin: and mightest thou lack sin, then shouldest thou have God.</p>
