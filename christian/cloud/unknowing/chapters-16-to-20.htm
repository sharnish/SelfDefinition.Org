                                <em>That by Virtue of this work a sinner truly turned and called to contemplation cometh
                                    sooner to perfection than by any other work; and by it soonest may get of God forgiveness
                                    of sins.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                LOOK that no man think it presumption, that he that is the wretchedest sinner of
                                this life dare take upon him after the time be that he have lawfully amended him,
                                and after that he have felt him stirred to that life that is called contemplative,
                                by the assent of his counsel and his conscience for to profer a meek stirring of
                                love to his God, privily pressing upon the cloud of unknowing betwixt him and his
                                God. When our Lord said to Mary, in person of all sinners that be called to contemplative
                                life, &quot;Thy sins be forgiven thee,&quot; it was not for her great sorrow, nor
                                for the remembering of her sins, nor yet for her meekness that she had in the beholding
                                of her wretchedness only. But why then? Surely because she loved much.</p>
                            <p>
                                Lo! here may men see what a privy pressing of love may purchase of our Lord, before
                                all other works that man may think. And yet I grant well, that she had full much
                                sorrow, and wept full sore for her sins, and full much she was meeked in remembrance
                                of her wretchedness. And so should we do, that have been wretches and accustomed
                                sinners; all our lifetime make hideous and wonderful sorrow for our sins, and full
                                much be meeked in remembrance of our wretchedness.</p>
                            <p>
                                But how? Surely as Mary did. She, although she might not feel the deep hearty sorrow
                                of her sins—for why, all her lifetime she had them with her whereso she went, as
                                it were in a burthen bounden together and laid up full privily in the hole of her
                                heart, in manner never to be forgotten—nevertheless yet, it may be said and affirmed
                                by Scripture, that she had a more hearty sorrow, a more doleful desire, and a more
                                deep sighing, and more she languished, yea! almost to the death, for lacking of
                                love, although she had full much love (and have no wonder thereof, for it is the
                                condition of a true lover that ever the more he loveth, the more he longeth for
                                to love), than she had for any remembrance of her sins.</p>
                            <p>
                                And yet she wist well, and felt well in herself in a sad soothfastness, that she
                                was a wretch most foul of all other, and that her sins had made a division betwixt
                                her and her God that she loved so much: and also that they were in great part cause
                                of her languishing sickness for lacking of love. But what thereof? Came she therefore
                                down from the height of desire into the deepness of her sinful life, and searched
                                in the foul stinking fen and dunghill of her sins; searching them up, by one and
                                by one, with all the circumstances of them, and sorrowed and wept so upon them each
                                one by itself? Nay, surely she did not so. And why? Because God let her wit by His
                                grace within in her soul, that she should never so bring it about. For so might
                                she sooner have raised in herself an ableness to have oft sinned, than to have purchased
                                by that work any plain forgiveness of all her sins.</p>
                            <p>
                                And therefore she hung up her love and her longing desire in this cloud of unknowing,
                                and learned her to love a thing the which she might not see clearly in this life,
                                by light of understanding in her reason, nor yet verily feel in sweetness of love
                                in her affection. Insomuch, that she had ofttimes little special remembrance, whether
                                that ever she had been a sinner or none. Yea, and full ofttimes I hope that she
                                was so deeply disposed to the love of His Godhead that she had but right little
                                special beholding unto the beauty of His precious and His blessed body, in the which
                                He sat full lovely speaking and preaching before her; nor yet to anything else,
                                bodily or ghostly. That this be sooth, it seemeth by the gospel.</p>

                                IN the gospel of Saint Luke it is written, that when our Lord was in the house of
                                Martha her sister, all the time that Martha made her busy about the dighting of
                                His meat, Mary her sister sat at His feet. And in hearing of His word she beheld
                                not to the business of her sister, although her business was full good and full
                                holy, for truly it is the first part of active life; nor yet to the preciousness
                                of His blessed body, nor to the sweet voice and the words of His manhood, although
                                it is better and holier, for it is the second part of active life and the first
                                of contemplative life.</p>
                            <p>
                                But to the sovereignest wisdom of His Godhead lapped in the dark words of His manhood,
                                thither beheld she with all the love of her heart. For from thence she would not
                                remove, for nothing that she saw nor heard spoken nor done about her; but sat full
                                still in her body, with many a sweet privy and a listy love pressed upon that high
                                cloud of unknowing betwixt her and her God. For one thing I tell thee, that there
                                was never yet pure creature in this life, nor never yet shall be, so high ravished
                                in contemplation and love of the Godhead, that there is not evermore a high and
                                a wonderful cloud of unknowing betwixt him and his God. In this cloud it was that
                                Mary was occupied with many a privy love pressed. And why? Because it was the best
                                and the holiest part of contemplation that may be in this life, and from this part
                                her list not remove for nothing. Insomuch, that when her sister Martha complained
                                to our Lord of her, and bade Him bid her sister rise and help her and let her not
                                so work and travail by herself, she sat full still and answered not with one word,
                                nor shewed not as much as a grumbling gesture against her sister for any plaint
                                that she could make. And no wonder: for why, she had another work to do that Martha
                                wist not of. And therefore she had no leisure to listen to her, nor to answer her
                                at her plaint.</p>
                            <p>
                                Lo! friend, all these works, these words, and these gestures, that were shewed betwixt
                                our Lord and these two sisters, be set in ensample of all actives and all contemplatives
                                that have been since in Holy Church, and shall be to the day of doom. For by Mary
                                is understood all contemplatives; for they should conform their living after hers.
                                And by Martha, actives on the same manner; and for the same reason in likeness.</p>

                            <p>
                                AND right as Martha complained then on Mary her sister, right so yet unto this day
                                all actives complain of contemplatives. For an there be a man or a woman in any
                                company of this world, what company soever it be, religious or seculars—I out-take
                                none—the which man or woman, whichever that it be, feeleth him stirred through grace
                                and by counsel to forsake all outward business, and for to set him fully for to
                                live contemplative life after their cunning and their conscience, their counsel
                                according; as fast, their own brethren and their sisters, and all their next friends,
                                with many other that know not their stirrings nor that manner of living that they
                                set them to, with a great complaining spirit shall rise upon them, and say sharply
                                unto them that it is nought that they do. And as fast they will reckon up many false
                                tales, and many true also, of falling of men and women that have given them to such
                                life before: and never a good tale of them that stood.</p>
                            <p>
                                I grant that many fall and have fallen of them that have in likeness forsaken the
                                world. And where they should have become God's servants and His contemplatives,
                                because that they would not rule them by true ghostly counsel they have become the
                                devil's servants and his contemplatives; and turned either to hypocrites or to heretics,
                                or fallen into frenzies and many other mischiefs, in slander of Holy Church. Of
                                the which I leave to speak at this time, for troubling of our matter. But nevertheless
                                here after when God vouchsafeth and if need be, men may see some of the conditions
                                and the cause of their failings. And therefore no more of them at this time; but
                                forth of our matter.</p>

                                <em>A short excusation of him that made this book teaching how all contemplatives should
                                    have all actives fully excused of their complaining words and deeds.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SOME might think that I do little worship to Martha, that special saint, for I liken
                                her words of complaining of her sister unto these worldly men's words, or theirs
                                unto hers: and truly I mean no unworship to her nor to them. And God forbid that
                                I should in this work say anything that might be taken in condemnation of any of
                                the servants of God in any degree, and namely of His special saint. For me thinketh
                                that she should be full well had excused of her plaint, taking regard to the time
                                and the manner that she said it in. For that that she said, her unknowing was the
                                cause. And no wonder though she knew not at that time how Mary was occupied; for
                                I trow that before she had little heard of such perfection. And also that she said,
                                it was but courteously and in few words: and therefore she should always be had
                                excused.</p>
                            <p>
                                And so me thinketh that these worldly living men and women of active life should
                                also full well be had excused of their complaining words touched before, although
                                they say rudely that they say; having beholding to their ignorance. For why? Right
                                as Martha wist full little what Mary her sister did when she complained of her to
                                our Lord; right so on the same manner these folk nowadays wot full little, or else
                                nought, what these young disciples of God mean, when they set them from the business
                                of this world, and draw them to be God's special servants in holiness and rightfulness
                                of spirit. And if they wist truly, I daresay that they would neither do nor say
                                as they say. And therefore me thinketh always that they should be had excused: for
                                why, they know no better living than is that they live in themselves. And also when
                                I think on mine innumerable defaults, the which I have made myself before this time
                                in words and deeds for default of knowing, me thinketh then if I would be had excused
                                of God for mine ignorant defaults, that I should charitably and piteously have other
                                men's ignorant words and deeds always excused. And surely else, do I not to others
                                as I would they did to me.</p>

                                AND therefore me thinketh, that they that set them to be contemplatives should not
                                only have active men excused of their complaining words, but also me thinketh that
                                they should be so occupied in spirit that they should take little heed or none what
                                men did or said about them. Thus did Mary, our example of all, when Martha her sister
                                complained to our Lord: and if we will truly do thus our Lord will do now for us
                                as He did then for Mary.</p>
                            <p>
                                And how was that? Surely thus. Our lovely Lord Jesus Christ, unto whom no privy
                                thing is hid, although He was required of Martha as doomsman for to bid Mary rise
                                and help her to serve Him; nevertheless yet, for He perceived that Mary was fervently
                                occupied in spirit about the love of His Godhead, therefore courteously and as it
                                was seemly for Him to do by the way of reason, He answered for her, that for the
                                excusing of herself list not leave the love of Him. And how answered He? Surely
                                not only as doomsman, as He was of Martha appealed: but as an advocate lawfully
                                defended her that Him loved, and said, &quot;Martha, Martha!&quot; Twice for speed
                                He named her name; for He would that she heard Him and took heed to His words. &quot;Thou
                                art full busy,&quot; He said, &quot;and troubled about many things.&quot; For they
                                that be actives behove always to be busied and travailed about many diverse things,
                                the which them falleth, first for to have to their own use, and sithen in deeds
                                of mercy to their even-christian, as charity asketh. And this He said unto Martha,
                                for He would let her wit that her business was good and profitable to the health
                                of her soul. But for this, that she should not think that it were the best work
                                of all that man might do, therefore He added and said: 'But one thing is necessary.'</p>
                            <p>
                                And what is that one thing? Surely that God be loved and praised by Himself, above
                                all other business bodily or ghostly that man may do. And for this, that Martha
                                should not think that she might both love God and praise Him above all other business
                                bodily or ghostly, and also thereto to be busy about the necessaries of this life:
                                therefore to deliver her of doubt that she might not both serve God in bodily business
                                and ghostly together perfectly—im-perfectly she may, but not perfectly—He added
                                and said, that Mary had chosen the best part; the which should never be taken from
                                her. For why, that perfect stirring of love that beginneth here is even in number
                                with that that shall last without end in the bliss of heaven, for all it is but
                                one.</p>
