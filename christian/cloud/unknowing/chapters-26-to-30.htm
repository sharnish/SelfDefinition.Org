                                    is right travailous; and in this work, which is the work of the soul helped by grace,
                                    and which is the work of only God.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AND therefore travail fast awhile, and beat upon this high cloud of unknowing, and
                                rest afterward. Nevertheless, a travail shall he have who so shall use him in this
                                work; yea, surely! and that a full great travail, unless he have a more special
                                grace, or else that he have of long time used him therein.</p>
                            <p>
                                But I pray thee, wherein shall that travail be? Surely not in that devout stirring
                                of love that is continually wrought in his will, not by himself, but by the hand
                                of Almighty God: the which is evermore ready to work this work in each soul that
                                is disposed thereto, and that doth that in him is, and hath done long time before,
                                to enable him to this work.</p>
                            <p>
                                But wherein then is this travail, I pray thee? Surely, this travail is all in treading
                                down of the remembrance of all the creatures that ever God made, and in holding
                                of them under the cloud of forgetting named before. In this is all the travail,
                                for this is man's travail, with help of grace. And the tother above—that is to say,
                                the stirring of love—that is the work of only God. And therefore do on thy work,
                                and surely I promise thee He shall not fail in His.</p>
                            <p>
                                Do on then fast; let see how thou bearest thee. Seest thou not how He standeth and
                                abideth thee? For shame! Travail fast but awhile, and thou shalt soon be eased of
                                the greatness and of the hardness of this travail. For although it be hard and strait
                                in the beginning, when thou hast no devotion; nevertheless yet after, when thou
                                hast devotion, it shall be made full restful and full light unto thee that before
                                was full hard. And thou shalt have either little travail or none, for then will
                                God work sometimes all by Himself. But not ever, nor yet no long time together,
                                but when Him list and as Him list; and then wilt thou think it merry to let Him
                                alone.</p>
                            <p>
                                Then will He sometimes peradventure send out a beam of ghostly light, piercing this
                                cloud of unknowing that is betwixt thee and Him; and shew thee some of His privity,
                                the which man may not, nor cannot speak. Then shalt thou feel thine affection inflamed
                                with the fire of His love, far more than I can tell thee, or may or will at this
                                time. For of that work, that falleth to only God, dare I not take upon me to speak
                                with my blabbering fleshly tongue: and shortly to say, although I durst I would
                                do not. But of that work that falleth to man when he feeleth him stirred and helped
                                by grace, list me well tell thee: for therein is the less peril of the two.</p>

                                BUT if thou asketh me when they should work in this work, then I answer thee and
                                I say: that not ere they have cleansed their conscience of all their special deeds
                                of sin done before, after the common ordinance of Holy Church.</p>
                            <p>
                                For in this work, a soul drieth up in it all the root and the ground of sin that
                                will always live in it after confession, be it never so busy. And, therefore, whoso
                                will travail in this work, let him first cleanse his conscience; and afterward when
                                he hath done that in him is lawfully, let him dispose him boldly but meekly thereto.
                                And let him think, that he hath full long been holden therefrom. For this is that
                                work in the which a soul should travail all his lifetime, though he had never sinned
                                deadly. And the whiles that a soul is dwelling in this deadly flesh, it shall evermore
                                see and feel this cumbrous cloud of unknowing betwixt him and God. And not only
                                that, but in pain of the original sin it shall evermore see and feel that some of
                                all the creatures that ever God made, or some of their works, will evermore press
                                in remembrance betwixt it and God. And this is the right wisdom of God, that man,
                                when he had sovereignty and lordship of all other creatures, because that he wilfully
                                made him underling to the stirring of his subjects, leaving the bidding of God and
                                his Maker; that right so after, when he would fulfil the bidding of God, he saw
                                and felt all the creatures that should be beneath him, proudly press above him,
                                betwixt him and his God.</p>

                                have been none; and that is great reason. Nevertheless, ofttimes it befalleth that
                                some that have been horrible and accustomed sinners come sooner to the perfection
                                of this work than those that have been none. And this is the merciful miracle of
                                our Lord, that so specially giveth His grace, to the wondering of all this world.
                                Now truly I hope that on Doomsday it shall be fair, when that God shall be seen
                                clearly and all His gifts. Then shall some that now be despised and set at little
                                or nought as common sinners, and peradventure some that now be horrible sinners,
                                sit full seemly with saints in His sight: when some of those that seem now full
                                holy and be worshipped of men as angels, and some of those yet peradventure, that
                                never yet sinned deadly, shall sit full sorry amongst hell caves.</p>
                            <p>
                                Hereby mayest thou see that no man should be judged of other here in this life,
                                for good nor for evil that they do. Nevertheless deeds may lawfully be judged, but
                                not the man, whether they be good or evil.</p>

                                Surely of them that have power, and cure of their souls: either given openly by
                                the statute and the ordinance of Holy Church, or else privily in spirit at the special
                                stirring of the Holy Ghost in perfect charity. Each man beware, that he presume
                                not to take upon him to blame and condemn other men's defaults, but if he feel verily
                                that he be stirred of the Holy Ghost within in his work; for else may he full lightly
                                err in his dooms. And therefore beware: judge thyself as thee list betwixt thee
                                and thy God or thy ghostly father, and let other men alone.</p>
