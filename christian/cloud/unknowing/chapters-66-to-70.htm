                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                SENSUALITY is a power of our soul, recking and reigning in the bodily wits, through
                                the which we have bodily knowing and feeling of all bodily creatures, whether they
                                be pleasing or unpleasing. And it hath two parts: one through the which it beholdeth
                                to the needfulness of our body, another through the which it serveth to the lusts
                                of the bodily wits. For this same power is it, that grumbleth when the body lacketh
                                the needful things unto it, and that in the taking of the need stirreth us to take
                                more than needeth in feeding and furthering of our lusts: that grumbleth in lacking
                                of pleasing creatures, and lustily is delighted in their presence: that grumbleth
                                in presence of misliking creatures, and is lustily pleased in their absence. Both
                                this power and the thing that it worketh in be contained in the Memory.</p>
                            <p>
                                Before ere man sinned was the Sensuality so obedient unto the Will, unto the which
                                it is as it were servant, that it ministered never unto it any unordained liking
                                or grumbling in any bodily creature, or any ghostly feigning of liking or misliking
                                made by any ghostly enemy in the bodily wits. But now it is not so: for unless it
                                be ruled by grace in the Will, for to suffer meekly and in measure the pain of the
                                original sin, the which it feeleth in absence of needful comforts and in presence
                                of speedful discomforts, and thereto also for to restrain it from lust in presence
                                of needful comforts, and from lusty plesaunce in the absence of speedful discomforts:
                                else will it wretchedly and wantonly welter, as a swine in the mire, in the wealths
                                of this world and the foul flesh so much that all our living shall be more beastly
                                and fleshly, than either manly or ghostly.</p>

                                so good an end, yet thou art beneath thyself in this working, and without any soul.
                                And ever when thou feelest thy Memory occupied with the subtle conditions of the
                                powers of thy soul and their workings in ghostly things, as be vices or virtues,
                                of thyself, or of any creature that is ghostly and even with thee in nature, to

                                perfection: then thou art within thyself, and even with thyself. But ever when thou
                                feelest thy Memory occupied with no manner of thing that is bodily or ghostly, but
                                only with the self substance of God, as it is and may be, in the proof of the work
                                of this book: then thou art above thyself and beneath thy God.</p>
                            <p>
                                Above thyself thou art: for why, thou attainest to come thither by grace, whither
                                thou mayest not come by nature. That is to say, to be oned to God, in spirit, and
                                in love, and in accordance of will. Beneath thy God thou art: for why, although
                                it may be said in manner, that in this time God and thou be not two but one in spirit—insomuch
                                that thou or another, for such onehead that feeleth the perfection of this work,
                                may soothfastly by witness of Scripture be called a God—nevertheless yet thou art
                                beneath Him. For why, He is God by nature without beginning; and thou, that sometime
                                wert nought in substance, and thereto after when thou wert by His might and His
                                love made ought, wilfully with sin madest thyself worse than nought, only by His
                                mercy without thy desert are made a God in grace, oned with Him in spirit without
                                departing, both here and in bliss of heaven without any end. So that, although thou
                                be all one with Him in grace, yet thou art full far beneath Him in nature.</p>
                            <p>
                                Lo, ghostly friend! hereby mayest thou see somewhat in part, that whoso knoweth
                                not the powers of their own soul, and the manner of their working, may full lightly
                                be deceived in understanding of words that be written to ghostly intent. And therefore
                                mayest thou see somewhat the cause why that I durst not plainly bid thee shew thy
                                desire unto God,</p>
                            <p>
                                but I bade thee childishly do that in thee is to hide it and cover it. And this
                                I do for fear lest thou shouldest conceive bodily that that is meant ghostly.</p>

                                wits wholly within thyself, and worship God there—although he say full well and
                                full truly, yea! and no man trulier, an he be well conceived—yet for fear of deceit

                                bid thee. Look on nowise that thou be within thyself. And shortly, without thyself
                                will I not that thou be, nor yet above, nor behind, nor on one side, nor on other.</p>

                                is everywhere ghostly. Look then busily that thy ghostly work be nowhere bodily;
                                and then wheresoever that that thing is, on the which thou wilfully workest in thy
                                mind in substance, surely there art thou in spirit, as verily as thy body is in
                                that place that thou art bodily. And although thy bodily wits can find there nothing
                                to feed them on, for them think it nought that thou dost, yea! do on then this nought,
                                and do it for God's love. And let not therefore, but travail busily in that nought
                                with a waking desire to will to have God that no man may know. For I tell thee truly,
                                that I had rather be so nowhere bodily, wrestling with that blind nought, than to
                                be so great a lord that I might when I would be everywhere bodily, merrily playing
                                with all this ought as a lord with his own.</p>

                                Reck thee never if thy wits cannot reason of this nought; for surely, I love it
                                much the better. It is so worthy a thing in itself, that they cannot reason thereupon.
                                This nought may better be felt than seen: for it is full blind and full dark to
                                them that have but little while looked thereupon. Nevertheless, if I shall soothlier
                                say, a soul is more blinded in feeling of it for abundance of ghostly light, than
                                for any darkness or wanting of bodily light. What is he that calleth it nought?
                                Surely it is our outer man, and not our inner. Our inner man calleth it All; for
                                of it he is well learned to know the reason of all things bodily or ghostly, without
                                any special beholding to any one thing by itself.</p>

                                <em>How that a man's affection is marvelously changed in ghostly feeling of this nought,
                                    when it is nowhere wrought.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                WONDERFULLY is a man's affection varied in ghostly feeling of this nought when it
                                is nowhere wrought. For at the first time that a soul looketh thereupon, it shall
                                find all the special deeds of sin that ever he did since he was born, bodily or
                                ghostly, privily or darkly painted thereupon. And howsoever that he turneth it about,
                                evermore they will appear before his eyes; until the time be, that with much hard
                                travail, many sore sighings, and many bitter weepings, he have in great part washed
                                them away. Sometime in this travail him think that it is to look thereupon as on
                                hell; for him think that he despaireth to win to perfection of ghostly rest out
                                of that pain. Thus far inwards come many, but for greatness of pain that they feel
                                and for lacking of comfort, they go back in beholding of bodily things: seeking
                                fleshly comforts without, for lacking of ghostly they have not yet deserved, as
                                they should if they had abided.</p>
                            <p>
                                For he that abideth feeleth sometime some comfort, and hath some hope of perfection;
                                for he feeleth and seeth that many of his fordone special sins be in great part
                                by help of grace rubbed away. Nevertheless yet ever among he feeleth pain, but he
                                thinketh that it shall have an end, for it waxeth ever less and less. And therefore
                                he calleth it nought else but purgatory. Sometime he can find no special sin written
                                thereupon, but yet him think that sin is a lump, he wot never what, none other thing
                                than himself; and then it may be called the base and the pain of the original sin.
                                Sometime him think that it is paradise or heaven, for diverse wonderful sweetness
                                and comforts, joys and blessed virtues that he findeth therein. Sometime him think
                                it God, for peace and rest that he findeth therein.</p>
                            <p>
                                Yea! think what he think will; for evermore he shall find it <em>a cloud of unknowing,
                                </em>that is betwixt him and his God.</p>

                                <em>That right as by the defailing of our bodily wits we begin more readily to come
                                    to knowing of ghostly things, so by the defailing of our ghostly wits we begin most
                                    readily to come to the knowledge of God, such as is possible by grace to be had

                                AND therefore travail fast in this nought, and this nowhere, and leave thine outward
                                bodily wits and all that they work in: for I tell thee truly, that this work may
                                not be conceived by them.</p>
                            <p>
                                For by thine eyes thou mayest not conceive of anything, unless it be by the length
                                and the breadth, the smallness and the greatness, the roundness and the squareness,
                                the farness and the nearness, and the colour of it. And by thine ears, nought but
                                noise or some manner of sound. By thine nose, nought but either stench or savour.
                                And by thy taste, nought but either sour or sweet, salt or fresh, bitter or liking.
                                And by thy feeling, nought but either hot or cold, hard or tender, soft or sharp.
                                And truly, neither hath God nor ghostly things none of these qualities nor quantities.
                                And therefore leave thine outward wits, and work not with them, neither within nor
                                without: for all those that set them to be ghostly workers within, and ween that
                                they should either hear, smell, or see, taste or feel, ghostly things, either within
                                them or without, surely they be deceived, and work wrong against the course of nature.</p>
                            <p>
                                For by nature they be ordained, that with them men should have knowing of all outward
                                bodily things, and on nowise by them come to the knowing of ghostly things. I mean
                                by their works. By their failings we may, as thus: when we read or hear speak of
                                some certain things, and thereto conceive that our outward wits cannot tell us by
                                no quality what those things be, then we may be verily certified that those things
                                be ghostly things, and not bodily things.</p>
                            <p>
                                On this same manner ghostly it fareth within our ghostly wits, when we travail about
                                the knowing of God Himself. For have a man never so much ghostly understanding in
                                knowing of all made ghostly things, yet may he never by the work of his understanding
                                come to the knowing of an unmade ghostly thing: the which is nought but God. But
                                by the failing it may: for why, that thing that it faileth in is nothing else but
                                only God. And therefore it was that Saint Denis said, <em>the most goodly knowing of
                                    God is that, the which is known by unknowing.</em> And truly, whoso will look
                                in Denis' books, he shall find that his words will clearly affirm all that I have
                                said or shall say, from the beginning of this treatise to the end. On otherwise
                                than thus, list me not cite him, nor none other doctor, for me at this time. For
                                sometime, men thought it meekness to say nought of their own heads, unless they
                                affirmed</p>
                            <p>
                                it by Scripture and doctors' words: and now it is turned into curiosity, and shewing
                                of cunning. To thee it needeth not, and therefore I do it not. For whoso hath ears,
                                let him hear, and whoso is stirred for to trow, let him trow: for else, shall they
                                not.</p>
