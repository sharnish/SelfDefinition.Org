                                I. To prevent the seculars from charging us with covetousness, it will be occasionally
                                proper to refuse the smaller alms, which are offered for services performed by the
                                society; from those, however, who are entirely devoted to us, it is best to accept even
                                the smallest offerings, lest we exhibit avarice, by admitting of none, but large gifts.
                            </p>
                            <p>II. Sepulchre in our churches should be denied to vile persons, although they may have
                                been greatly attached to the order, for a multitude of such tombs, might make us
                                suspected of covetousness, and the very benefits received from the dead, be discovered.
                            </p>
                            <p>III. Other things being equal, those widows and other persons, who have given most of
                                their effects to the society, are to be treated with more decision and firmness, than
                                othersâ€”that we may avoid the appearance of favoring them, in preference to others, on
                                account of their munificence; the same rule should be observed with regard to the
                                members of the society, but not until they have made a cession and surrender of their
                                wealth to it: after that, if it be necessary, they might be dismissed from the society,
                                but with infinite discretion, in order to secure the present relinquishment, or the
                                devise at death, of at least a part of what they may have presented to the order.</p>
