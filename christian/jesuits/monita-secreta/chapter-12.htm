                                I. The first rank is due to diligent laborers, who promote equally the temporal and
                                spiritual good of the order, such are most frequently, the confessors of princes and
                                nobles, widows, and rich devotees, as well as preachers and professors, all in short,
                                who know these secrets.</p>
                            <p>II. The second place belongs to those, who waisted in strength and decrepid with age,
                                have spent their talents, for the temporal good of the society; and this as well out of
                                a decent regard to their past services, as, the rather, because they are suitable
                                instruments for reporting to the superiors the usual defects, which being constantly at
                                home, they perceive in other members.</p>
                            <p>III. These last must never be discharged, if possible to avoid it, lest the society be
                                reproached.</p>
                            <p>IV. Next let all be favored as they are distinguished for understanding, high birth, and
                                riches, particularly if they have powerful friends and kindred who are attached to the
                                society, and are themselves sincerely devoted to it, in the manner aforesaid; let such
                                be sent to <span class="smcap">Rome</span>, or to the more celebrated universities to
                                study; but if they should study in the provinces, they are to be encouraged by the
                                utmost kindness and indulgence on the part of the professors, and up to the moment of
                                their surrendering every thing to the society, nothing is to be denied them; after that,
                                however, they are to be mortified like the rest, some regard perhaps, being always had
                                to the past.</p>
                            <p>V. The superiors must also show peculiar respect to those who may have drawn any clever
                                youths into the society, whereby they have not a little proven their love for it; but so
                                long as these are not yet professed, let not the others be too much indulged; lest
                                possibly, they should withdraw from the society, those whom they led into it.</p>
