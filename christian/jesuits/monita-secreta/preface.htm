                                These <em>Secret Counsels</em>, the superiors should diligently keep, and preserve among
                                themselves; and only communicate them to a few of the professed, and instil some of them
                                into those who are not professed, when it evidently may be done with much advantage to
                                the <em>Society</em> <span class="note">[Society of Jesus]</span>; and then only under
                                the seal of secrecy, and not then as if prescribed by any one, but as the fruits of
                                personal experience; and because many of the professed know these secrets, from their
                                commencement, the <em>Society</em> has especially provided that no one acquainted with
                                them should remove himself to other religious orders, except to the
                                <em>Carthusians</em>, because of their perpetual solitude of life and obligatory
                                silence; which the Holy See has confirmed.
                            </p>
                            <p>The utmost care should be taken that these <em>counsels</em> should not come into the
                                hands of strangers, because envying our destiny they would maliciously misinterpret
                                them; but should this occur, which must be prevented if possible, let it be denied that
                                these are the principles of the society, and this denial confirmed by those of us, whom
                                we certainly know to be ignorant of these rules; and let our public instructions, and
                                our rules or regulations printed or written, be set in opposition to them.</p>
                            <p>Let the superiors also, always carefully and cautiously inquire whether these
                                <em>counsels</em> have been made known to strangers by any of us; and also, let none
                                transcribe them for himself or for another, unless by consent of a general or
                                provincial; and if there be a doubt of any oneâ€™s fitness to be intrusted with such
                                important secrets of the society, convince him that you confide in him, but drop him.
