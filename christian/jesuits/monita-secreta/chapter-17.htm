                                I. On this subject, it should be the grand effort of all, to be always uniform in
                                sentiment, or at least, to declare to others that they are so, even in relation to the
                                smallest matter, from whence it must necessarily be, no matter how great the disturbance
                                of human affairs, that the society shall be continually increased and strengthened.</p>
                            <p>II. Let all so endeavour to shine, by their learning and their conduct, that other
                                orders, and especially such members of them as preach, are pastors, &amp;c., may be so
                                eclipsed, that at length the common people may desire that we exclusively, should
                                perform all offices; let it be openly taught, however, that learning alone is not
                                sufficient for pastors, but they must be well grounded in their peculiar duties, for the
                                society can help them with counsel, which for that very reason, sets so great a value on
                                its acquirements.</p>
                            <p>III. Kings and princes ought to be impressed with the truth that under present
                                circumstances, the Catholic faith cannot exist without politism—but this demands great
                                discretion; for which purpose our members must have rendered themselves acceptable to
                                the great, and acquainted with their most secret purposes.</p>
                            <p>IV. They should have the advantage of the most recent, important, and certain
                                information, from every quarter.</p>
                            <p>V. It would be advantageous, if we could cautiously and secretly foment dissentions
                                amongst nobles and princes, even to the mutual wasting of their strength; but if they
                                seem likely to be reconciled, the society should immediately endeavor to pacify them,
                                lest it should be effected by some other intervention.</p>
                            <p>VI. The opinion that the society was produced by a remarkable interposition of divine
                                providence, for the restoration of the church, depressed by heretics, according to the
                                revelation of the abbot <span class="smcap">Joachim</span>, ought to be sedulously
                                inculcated, on the great, as well as the common people.</p>
                            <p>VII. As soon as the favor of distinguished men and bishops is conciliated, let our
                                members secure the cases and canonries, for the complete reformation of the clergy, who
                                once lived under certain regulations with their respective bishops, and advanced toward
                                perfection; then they should aspire to abbacies and prelacies, which, if we consider the
                                sloth and stupidity of the monks, might be easily obtained when they become vacant: for
                                it would be exceedingly advantageous to the church for all the bishopricks to be held by
                                the society, indeed for it to possess the apostolic see; especially when his holiness
                                once more becomes a great temporal prince: wherefore let every method be used, prudently
                                and secretly by degrees, to enlarge the temporalities of the society, as there can be no
                                doubt, but that the golden age of constant and universal peace would then abide, and
                                with it, the divine blessing, upon the church.</p>
                            <p>VIII. But when the hope of attaining to this state may not be bright, and inasmuch as
                                offences needs must come, we must temporarily change our policy, and excite princes
                                whose friendship we enjoy, to mutual and fierce contests; in order that the society may
                                be solicited and employed every where for the general pacification, and then as the
                                constant author of good, be compensated with the principal benefices and ecclesiastical
                                dignities.</p>
                            <p>IX. In fine, let the society, by acquiring the favors and authority of princes, endeavor
                                at least to effect this—that all shall fear, who will not love us.</p>
