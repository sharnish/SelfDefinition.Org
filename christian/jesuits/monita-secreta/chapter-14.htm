                                I. Besides the cases laid down in the constitutions, in which a superior alone, or an
                                ordinary confessor, by the license of the superior, can grant absolution, there are,
                                sodomy, wantonness, fornication, adultery, incest, male or female uncleanness as well as
                                one’s becoming the cause, or even the occasion, and through the utmost zeal, even of any
                                injury to the society, to its honor or success—all which are just causes for dismission.
                            </p>
                            <p>II. When any one shall sacramentally confess any thing of this kind, he shall not be
                                absolved, until he has promised, that, besides the confession, he will, personally or
                                through his confessor, discover himself to the superior; then the superior must
                                determine what seems best for the common good of the society; for if there be certain
                                hope, that the crime may be concealed, it can be punished by an adequate penance, if
                                otherwise, let him be immediately dismissed; the confessor, however, will be careful not
                                to tell the penitent his danger of dismission.</p>
                            <p>III. If any confessor should hear, from a strange woman, that she has carnally known some
                                member of the society, he must not absolve her, unless besides her confession, she
                                reveals the name of her paramour, nor even then, until she shall solemnly swear never to
                                disclose it again to any mortal, without the society’s consent.</p>
                            <p>IV. If two members, sin carnally, and one discovers it first, let him be retained in the
                                society, and the other dismissed; but the one retained should be afterwards so humbled
                                and constantly worried, that through weariness and impatience, he may offer an occasion
                                for dismission, which is to be instantly seized.</p>
                            <p>V. Our society must, if it would perpetuate in the church its noble and exalted
                                association, cut off such persons, as appear at all unfit for our purpose, even though
                                they begin well; and occasion will readily be found, if they be continually vexed, and
                                all things managed contrary to their wishes, by subjecting them to harsh superiors,
                                depriving them of more honorable pursuits and functions, &amp;c., until they murmur.</p>
                            <p>VI. None are by any means to be retained, who openly oppose the superiors, or complain
                                either publicly or privately, to their companions, or what is worse to those not
                                members; nor in like manner, they who, whether at home or abroad, condemn our method of
                                proceeding, as to the acquisition or administration of wealth, or indeed any thing else,
                                as, for example, the method of crushing and suppressing the disaffected, or the
                                dismissed, &amp;c.; neither they who tolerate or defend the <em>Venetians</em>, the
                                <em>French</em>, or any others from whom the society has suffered oppression or still
                                sorer injuries.
                            </p>
                            <p>VII. All who are to be dismissed should be treated beforehand with the greatest severity;
                                let them be deprived of their usual employment; let them be applied first to one thing,
                                then to another, and no matter how well they may succeed, blame them, and under this
                                pretence change their employment; for the slightest accidental faults, impose heavy
                                penances, rebuke them publicly in an insupportable manner, and finally discharge them,
                                as if they were pernicious to others; but let an opportunity for this be selected, which
                                will be the least apprehended by them.</p>
                            <p>VIII. If any of our members should have a sure prospect of obtaining a bishopric, or
                                other ecclesiastical dignity, he should be compelled, in addition to the accustomed vow
                                of the society, to take another, that he will always esteem and commend our institution,
                                that he will use no confessor, who is not one of us, in short that he will determine
                                nothing, in any important matter, but in accordance with the judgment of the society; in
                                consequence of the non-observance of which by Cardinal <span class="smcap">Tolet</span>,
                                the society obtained from the <em>holy see</em>, that afterwards no <em>Maronite</em>,
                                the perfidious offspring of the Jews or Mahomedans, should be admitted; and whoever
                                refuses this vow, no matter how distinguished he may be, must be dismissed as the worst
                                enemy of the society.</p>
