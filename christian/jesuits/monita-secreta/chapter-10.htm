                                I. Let every one, of whatever condition or age, be dismissed as an enemy of the society, but under another pretext, who shall alienate our devotees and other friends from our churches, and from resorting to us, or who shall divert alms to other churches or orders, or shall attempt to seduce any wealthy or well affected person from the society; and also those who when they dispose of their effects shall show greater affection for their relations than for the society; for this is a great sign of an unmortified mind, and it is proper that the professed should be thoroughly mortified; so of all who shall turn alms taken from penitents or other friends of the society to their own poor relations. But that they may not afterwards make complaints of the cause of their dismission, let them not be at once dismissed, but let them at first be prohibited from hearing confessions; and be mortified and vexed with the exercise of the meanest offices; let them be obliged daily to perform those to which they are known to have the greatest aversion, let them be removed from higher studies and honorable occupations, and let them be provoked with chapters and public censures; let them be kept from recreations and from intercourse with strangers, let those things which are not absolutely necessary in dress and other indispensable things, be withheld till they are forced to murmuring and impatience; and then, as persons too little mortified, and injurious to others by an evil example, let them be dismissed; and if a reason of their dismission should be required by their parents or the prelates of the church, let them be represented as not having the spirit of the society.</p>
                            <p>II. Let such be dismissed, moreover, as have any scruples in acquiring riches for the society, and let them be represented as too confident in their own judgment, but if they should wish to give the reason of their conduct, to the provincials, let them not be heard, but compelled to observe the rule which binds all to render blind obedience.</p>
                            <p>III. Let it be considered from the beginning, even from infancy, who go farthest in devotion to the society; and who are observed to entertain regard for other orders, or for the poor, or for their parents, and as such will be useless in future, let them be gradually prepared for dismission in the aforesaid manner.</p>
