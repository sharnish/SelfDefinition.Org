                                What the Manifested God is: and of the Trinity
                            </h3>

                        <p>
                            1. IF we would understand what the new birth is, and how it is brought <sup>[1]</sup>
                            to pass, then we must first know what man is, and how he is the image of God; and
                            what the divine indwelling <sup>[2]</sup> is; also what the revealed God is; of
                            whom man is an image.
                        </p>
                         <p class="fnote">
                            [1. Wrought, or effected.]
                        </p>
                        <p class="fnote">
                            [2. Or how God dwells in man, and fills all things with his presence.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. When I consider what God is, then I say, He is the One; in reference to the creature,
                            as an eternal Nothing; he has neither foundation, beginning, nor abode; he possesses
                            nothing, save only himself; he is the will of the abyss; he is in himself only one;
                            he needs neither space, nor place; he begets himself in himself; from eternity to
                            eternity; he is neither like nor resembles any thing; and has no peculiar place
                            where he dwells; <sup>[3]</sup> the eternal wisdom or understanding is his dwelling;
                            he is the will of the wisdom; the wisdom is his manifestation.
                        </p>
                       
                        <p class="fnote">
                            [3. Or no sundry habitation above the stars in an empyrean heaven, as reason fancies.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3. In this eternal generation we are to understand three things, viz. 1. An eternal
                            will. 2. An eternal mind of the will. 3. The egress <sup>[4]</sup> from the will
                            and mind, which is a spirit of the will and mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4. The will is father; the mind is the conceived <sup>[5]</sup> of the will, viz.
                            the seat or habitation of the will, or the centre to something; and it is the will's
                            heart; and the egress of the will and mind is the power and spirit.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fnote">
                            [4. Efflux, effluence, the proceeding-forth.]
                        </p>
                        <p class="fnote">
                            [5. Comprehension or receptacle.]

                        <p>
                            5. This threefold <sup>[6]</sup> spirit is one only essence, and yet it is no essence,
                            but the eternal understanding, an original of the something: and yet it is the eternal
                            hiddenness <sup>[7]</sup> (just as the understanding of man is not confined in time
                            and place, but is its own comprehension and seat), and the egress of the spirit
                            is the eternal original contemplation, viz. a lubet [imagination, desire, or magia]
                            of the spirit.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fnote">
                            [6. Or Tri-Une.]
                        </p>
                         <p class="fnote">
                            [7. Or mystical Mystery.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6. The egressed <sup>[8]</sup> is called the lubet of the Deity, or the eternal
                            wisdom, which is the eternal original of all powers, colours and virtues; by which
                            the threefold spirit comes, in this lubet, to a desiring, namely, of the powers,
                            colours, and virtues; and its desiring is an impressing, a conceiving itself: The
                            will conceives the wisdom in the mind, and the conceived in the understanding is
                            the eternal word of all colours, powers, and virtues; which the eternal will expresses
                            <sup>[9]</sup> by the spirit from the understanding of the mind.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fnote">
                            [8. That which is flown forth from the one eternal will.]
                        </p>
                        <p class="fnote">
                            [9. Or speaks forth.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            7. And this speaking is the motion or life of the Deity, an eye of the eternal seeing,
                            where one power, colour and virtue does know each of the others, and does distinguish
                            each from the other; and yet they all stand in equal proportion <sup>[10]</sup>
                            or analogy, devoid of weight, limit or measure, also undivided one from another.
                            All the powers, colours and virtues lie in one; and it is a distinct, mutual, well-tuned,
                            pregnant harmony; or, as I might say, a speaking word, in which word or speaking
                            all speeches, powers, colours and virtues are contained, and with the pronouncing
                            or speaking they unfold themselves, and bring themselves into sight and ken.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fnote">
                            [10. Text, property.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            8. This is now the eye of the abyss, the eternal chaos, wherein all (whatsoever
                            eternity and time has) is contained; and it is called Counsel, Power, Wonder and
                            Virtue. Its peculiar and proper name is called GOD, or JEOVA, or JEHOVAH, who is
                            outside of all nature, without all beginnings of any essence, a working in himself;
                            generating, finding, or perceiving himself; without any kind of source from any
                            thing, or by any thing: He has neither beginning nor end, he is immeasurable, no
                            number can express his largeness, and greatness, he is deeper than any thought can
                            reach; he is nowhere far from any thing, or nigh unto any thing; he is through all,
                            and in all: his birth is everywhere, and without and besides him there is nothing
                            else: he is time and eternity, byss [ground or foundation] and abyss, and yet nothing
                            comprehends him save the true understanding, which is God himself.
