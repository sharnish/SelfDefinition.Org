                                    But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair</p>
                                <p>
                                    With dawning answers there,</p>

                                    Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.

                                    Underneath her azured da&#239;s,</p>

                                    Quaffing, as your taintless way is,

                                    So it was done:</p>

                                    I in their delicate fellowship was one&mdash;</p>

                                    Drew the bolt of Nature&apos;s secrecies.

                                    I knew how the clouds arise</p>
                                <p>
                                    Spum&egrave;d of the wild sea-snortings;</p>

                                    Rose and drooped with; made them shapers</p>

                                    Of mine own moods, or wailful or divine;</p>

                                    With them joyed and was bereaven.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I was heavy with the even,</p>
                                <p>
                                    When she lit her glimmering tapers

                                <p>
                                    Round the day&apos;s dead sanctities.</p>

                                    I laughed in the morning&apos;s eyes.</p>
                                <p>
                                    I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,</p>

                                    Heaven and I wept together,</p>

                                    And its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine;

                                <p>
                                    Against the red throb of its sunset-heart</p>
                                <p>
                                    I laid my own to beat,</p>

                                    And share commingling heat;</p>

                                    But not by that, by that, was eased my human smart.</p>
                                <p>
                                    In vain my tears were wet on Heaven&apos;s grey cheek.

                                    Nature, poor stepdame, cannot slake my drouth;</p>

                                    The breasts o&apos; her tenderness:</p>

                                    Never did any milk of hers once bless</p>

                                    My thirsting mouth.</p>

                                    My harness piece by piece Thou hast hewn from me,</p>

                                    And smitten me to my knee;</p>

                                    I slept, methinks, and woke,

                                <p>
                                    And, slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep.</p>
                                <p>
                                    In the rash lustihead of my young powers,</p>

                                    I shook the pillaring hours</p>

                                    And pulled my life upon me; grimed with smears,</p>
                                <p>
                                    I stand amid the dust o&apos; the mounded years&mdash;

                                    My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,</p>

                                    Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.</p>

                                    The dreamer, and the lute the lutanist;

                                    I swung the earth a trinket at my wrist,</p>

                                    Are yielding; cords of all too weak account</p>

                                    For earth with heavy griefs so overplussed.</p>

                                    Ah! is Thy love indeed

                                    A weed, albeit an amaranthine weed,</p>

                                    Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?</p>

                                <p>
                                    My freshness spent its wavering shower i&apos; the dust;</p>

                                    And now my heart is as a broken fount,</p>

                                    Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever</p>
                                <p>
                                    From the dank thoughts that shiver</p>
                                <p>
                                    Upon the sighful branches of my mind.

                                <p>
                                    Such is; what is to be?</p>

                                    The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind?</p>
                                <p>
                                    I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds;</p>

                                    Yet ever and anon a trumpet sounds</p>

                                    From the hid battlements of Eternity;

                                <p>
                                    Those shaken mists a space unsettle, then</p>

                                    Round the half-glimps&egrave;d turrets slowly wash again.</p>
                                <p>
                                    But not ere him who summoneth</p>
                                <p>
                                    I first have seen, enwound</p>
                                <p>
                                    With glooming robes purpureal, cypress-crowned;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    His name I know, and what his trumpet saith.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Whether man&apos;s heart or life it be which yields</p>

                                    Thee harvest, must Thy harvest-fields</p>
                                <p>
                                    Be dunged with rotten death?</p>

                                    Now of that long pursuit

                                <p>
                                    Comes on at hand the bruit;</p>
                                <p>
                                    That Voice is round me like a bursting sea:</p>
                                <p>
                                    &apos;And is thy earth so marred,</p>

                                    Shattered in shard on shard?</p>

                                    Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest Me!

                                <p>
                                    Strange, piteous, futile thing!</p>

                                    Wherefore should any set thee love apart?</p>

                                    Seeing none but I makes much of naught&apos; (He said),</p>
                                <p>
                                    &apos;And human love needs human meriting:</p>

                                    How hast thou merited&mdash;

                                    Of all man&apos;s clotted clay the dingiest clot?</p>
                                <p>
                                    Alack, thou knowest not</p>
                                <p>
                                    How little worthy of any love thou art!</p>
                                <p>
                                    Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee,</p>

                                    Save Me, save only Me?

                                <p>
                                    All which I took from thee I did but take,</p>
                                <p>
                                    Not for thy harms,</p>
                                <p>
                                    But just that thou might&apos;st seek it in My arms.</p>
                                <p>
                                    All which thy child&apos;s mistake</p>
                                <p>
                                    Fancies as lost, I have stored for thee at home:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Rise, clasp My hand, and come!&apos;</p>
                                <p>
                                    Halts by me that footfall:</p>
                                <p>
                                    Is my gloom, after all,</p>

                                    Shade of His hand, outstretched caressingly?</p>
