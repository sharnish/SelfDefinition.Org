									Friend Al,
								</p>
								<p>
									But how can I be sure you are a friend? For all I know it might be something entirely
									different writing... hiding behind the postage stamp... behind space. I would have
									like to have been a little more scientific about your claims... investigated them
									first hand. But I recognized that while you might have something to fear or hide
									from a frustrated neophyte, I recognized the possible truth that I might not be
									able to tell much actually from first hand analysis.
								</p>
								<p>
									You are unfair. This is by your own words. You resent and hint anathema at such
									trifling things as my caution, and your style of writing is so vitriolic that I
									wonder that anyone could insult you. Yet I hesitated to say anything that might
									hurt your feelings. I have commented about the reasonableness of statements but
									there has been no intention to tell you off.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am tempted though. Surely you are not so naive as to think that I should accept
									everything anyone says. And there is no point in threatening to tell me to go to
									hell just because I do not agree.
								</p>
								<p>
									In fact those are the little things that cast the doubt in my mind, more than the
									wealth or lack of reason. I can understand that you would want to share an experience
									if you had something bid, but when peoople get big they just do not have the urge
									to tell the less fortunate to go to hell. And I presume that is what you mean when
									you say you are tempted to say the obvious.
								</p>
								<p>
									Almost grudgingly now you tell me that the mind lives unendingly. How do you know?
									(written in longhand)
								</p>
								<p>
									Why? How do I know that you know. What are jivan-muktis? You do a little name-dropping.
									If I thought anything could be deduced from reading about Jesus or Buddha (since
									they wrote nothing) I would not be writing to you. I cannot ascertain if they existed.
									The Catholics claim that their people run clear back to Peter, but that claim does
									not mean a thing to me. I do not have the time to prove it, nor to prove the true
									origin of the Masons... since I have no assurance that knowing the unbroken chain
									of heredity would provide any qualitative knowledge of the first link.
								</p>
								<p>
									Sometimes I think you are just an overgrown beatnik with a Russian sense of humor.
									Do you mean that your wife does not believe in the magnitude of your nothingness?
									My wife (amazingly different) knows me to be a hypocrite that I am. I keep telling
									her that I am but a mite of the Almighty and I get the same reaction that I get
									from you. "You are just saying this because it sounds big to make a claim that cannot
									be evaluated." Who knows? Perhaps my wife is a Zen master in disguise.
								</p>
								<p>
									Of course the same applies to you. You defy evaluation. I am not as yet trying to
									evaluate you as much as to get some material to use in evaluating.
								</p>
								<p>
									So far I get a picture of Atman and Brahma (Brahman?) Check me if I am wrong. Or
									is the little individual mind merging with the universal mind? Now if this is the
									case, does the individual (mind or spirit) lose its identity upon merging? Does
									it lose self-consciousness?
								</p>
								<p>
									If it does not, and presuming you have attained the merger, Why have you not been
									able to identify dead relatives? If you knew everything, then why have you not able
									to discredit or explain other concepts and phenomena that lead men to believe other
									concepts?
								</p>
								<p>
									What is the value of Kriya yoga technique. Is the Word of God (Logos) actually an
									audible sound?
								</p>
								<p>
									Without asking for it I find that you find it fitting to again remind me that you
									would not want me to visit you. Now I ponder about this persistence. I realize that
									you all are transcendentalists and would have to run out and get a plumber to put
									in some plumbing to keep me from stinking up your place... no explanation is necessary.
									But then I also think (since I must be honest with you) that perhaps he is a little
									afraid that I am Tesla's pigeon... there is a light in my eye that you might not
									like.
								</p>
								<p>
									You note that my correspondence is dull. At this point I note that you have the
									initiative.
								</p>
								<p>
									What is a guru?
