									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									You have a marvelous sense of humor. Be careful... Freud says that wit is sublimated sex.
								</p>
								<p>
									Yes, I know (how many times do you want me to tell you) that I'm egocentric. In fact, it flatters me to think that I am capable of being egocentric.
								</p>
								<p>
									What does any man do that is not for the self? Even if he desires immortality that is egotistic... for it may be well said that who is he that should have the right to live forever.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now if that which inspires us for a path must later be abandoned to gain the same objective, all is good.
								</p>
								<p>
									So far... let me try to summarize...
								</p>
								<p>
									I write a letter and say Hello Mr. Pulyan, I am interested in know what you know, and if it will be of any benefit to me.
								</p>
								<p>
									And you write back and take each word apart. You may indicate that when I use "I" I am being egocentric, (which I know). Also that when I say that "I know" that I am being egotistical, because it is possible that I know nothing for sure.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now you tell me how to quit the egocentric position. I am afraid I will always be selfish enough to try to find some sort of immortality. If there is no continuation or life after death, then why all the hubbub?
								</p>
								<p>
									All of your analyses of my words is largely accurate... but I could read you the same way. For all I know Pulyan is playing god, and he has some clever tricks to eliminate opposition.
								</p>
								<p>
									I do not expect miracles unless you make claims that you can perform same. (underlining words is egotism, yes I know)
								</p>
								<p>
									You speak of friendship. Please give your definition,-or what you want this friendship to be. I am trying to find some ground for understanding with little complaint for your bluntness. However in each letter you have assured me that I deserve to be dropped. (from what?) "What do you want for $.04?" and in this letter you picture yourself waving your hand goodbye from around the corner. Shall our reciprocity be petulance?
								</p>
								<p>
									You frighten me. I am constantly in danger of losing something. What something? Don't ask what something. You are nothing, egotistically pretending that you are going to know something.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now if I am nothing what can I lose?
								</p>
								<p>
									No it is not "up to you"... mother because you love me to save me. It is up to you to validate your claims... in order to speak a common language. If we are going to spin fiction back and forth, then let me know it. If spring the God-angle was shaking the rattle to attract my attention, it seems superfluous, because you protest to the seriousness and sacredness of the subject. Are we dealing in the "Truth" or in a treatise on double talk?
								</p>
								<p>
									Conceding that there is an "X" quantity of which you are aware, and of which I am not aware, it is entirely useless to make claims about knowledge of ultimates to another whose knowledge is known to be extremely small and incapable of knowing anything at all of ultimates. What is there to gain?
