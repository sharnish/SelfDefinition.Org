									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									You want my reaction. To what? To your efforts to batter yourself with a word that begets a word. To your claims of contact with godhead? I shall not call you a liar and cannot--you have made the claims, now it is up to you to validate them or try another tack. If I am so ignorant as you must infer, (and I freely admit to anyone) then I cannot be expected to understand your statements which are cast forth on a take it or leave it basis.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have no idea what I am supposed to extract from Pulyan and in all probability will not know until it is extracted what the essence of the message was supposed to be. Pulyan, being like unto God (whatever that is) is in a better position to extract than me.
								</p>
								<p>
									To me it matters not the least if this Richard Rose is one voice or many voices, is an escapist or a dreamer, if I am but a dream of a Dreamer. However, I am interested in knowing the Truth, and if man has no individual soul, no immortality, then I will continue plugging until I know or am convinced before I start doing nothing.
								</p>
								<p>
									I do not know where the Truth is. I do not even know if man is capable of knowing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let me put it this way. I pretend to be a seeker after Truth. I am looking for fellow seekers, preferable those who know more than myself, whether that "more" be data or ways and means to find or become.
								</p>
								<p>
									You are not a master (what is a master?) because a fellow named Mac might say that you are. You are first a correspondent until I can find what you are. (You know all this, why do you insist upon me explaining it to you?)
								</p>
								<p>
									If you do not want me to use words based or rooted in egotism, I will send you a blank sheet of paper. I could not even propose to merely say thanks... that too would be egotistical, for what timidity might prompt me to suppose that I had anything at all to do about appreciation.
								</p>
								<p>
									I feel badly that you write so much. I know how long it must take, and I know that you are trying to put something across. You are making a thousand guesses. Do not guess, just tell me.
								</p>
								<p>
									Words like Satori, samadhi, nirvana, cannot be explained or defined. I do not try, but still I do not see any reason for calling a man a liar if he claims to have or be something unusual.
								</p>
								<p>
									I had an experience when I was about thirty years of age. At the time I thought it was a result of some of the things I was doing at the time. I thought it was a bit of insanity that resulted from pulling in two opposite directions at once.
								</p>
								<p>
									I saw myself above the world, and saw all of humanity upon the earth And I watched myself down there walking the street. I sat down and wrote my experience which may have only been a totalizing of my experiences and coordinations to that date... it amounted to being something that is and is not, that lives and lives not, this is everything lamenting the knowledge of its nothingness.
								</p>
								<p>
									I put it this way also. I am not much, and being not much cannot do much. You know God... you tell him to help you do what you are trying so hard to do. For after all you and He shall fail... more than the microcosm... or the dream (or dreamer) that cannot awaken itself.
								</p>
								<p>
									Best wishes for early success.
								</p>
