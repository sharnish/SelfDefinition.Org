									Friend Al,
								</p>
								<p>
									Just got your card. <sup>[1]</sup> Many thanks. Will try. Did not have the flu.
									I have recurrent bronchitis. When it gets damp it recurs. However the main trouble
									was in the sigmoid flexure of the colon. Cystitis of the bladder than along came
									the bronchitis back. I couldn't shake it. Thought I had cancer of the colon. This
									because of the pain, and the kindly advice of the doc to make certain financial
									arrangements.
								</p>
								<p class="fnote">
									[1. Postcard is missing.]
								</p>
								<p>
									Enough of that. I have mislaid your last letter, but I remember the most of it.
									I deplore friction, and would rather not communicate than continually be at one
									another's throats. I know that there is the temptation which you have extended,
									that big things may be gained.
								</p>
								<p>
									I get rather confused. I know that nothing has ever been proven logically, or by
									reason. Yet we have to use some medium of communication... and while a "koan" may
									be a sublime vector indicating or inspiring bigness... I am still stuck with the
									need to be rational or attempt to be.
								</p>
								<p>
									The most of my irritation stems from not being able to pin you down. Yet I felt
									amenable to continuing what was apparently a mad-ball correspondence if it produced
									anything. If we are not going to be logical or pretend to try to be, then it should
									not matter what I write.
								</p>
								<p>
									I do not know you. And I know that nobody could expect me to, under the conditions.
									You often refer to psychoanalytic value to the letters. Anybody sane by modern psychiatric
									standards would say we were both nuts if they read our mail. And a man would indeed
									be foolish to commit himself to someone he did not know.
								</p>
								<p>
									Despite all this, (as you hint) I do not wish to pass up a chance to grow in the
									right direction. I sometimes get the feeling that you might well be in a position
									to do as much harm as good... if so inclined. Then I think of the words of St. Teresa,
									St. John of the Cross and a few others (who previously I thought to be drunk on
									mysticism) and then maybe that is what you are driving at.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another factor of difficulty: Up to now, I have made a search for the truth, by
									following the idea that it permeated all religions and that all I had to do was
									narrow down least common denominators of all of them. From this I arrived at a position
									only recently where I thought I was close. But then your statements give almost
									an opposite claim. All my diggings amount to nothing... or your are pulling my leg.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let me know if you really think my case is hopeless. If you really have something...
									there may be others more receptive. Hope not. But I feel that I will fight you all
									the way until I get some sort of conviction that you are not so ambiguous as your
									letters read.
								</p>

									Sincerely,
								</p>
