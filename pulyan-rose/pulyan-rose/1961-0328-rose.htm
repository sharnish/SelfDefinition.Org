									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									It is true that miracles interest me. They are the challenge to the pseudo-sciences.
									They indicate that man has not closed all the gaps in his concepts. However I am
									not so much a "miracle-monger" as a miracle buyer.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the second to fourth paragraphs of your letter you inform me that you are not
									only 100 proof, 14 karat, and one of the original McCoys, but also seem taken aback
									that I failed to recognize you as such. (And all the time you know that I have no
									yardsticks for measuring).
								</p>
								<p>
									Then in the sixth paragraph you make a note that you only think that Krishnamurti
									was an awakened one. If you met him and were not sure, how do you expect me to be
									sure of a guy I have not ever met? (Especially when I would not know an awakened
									person if I met one.)
								</p>
								<p>
									A couple letters past I mentioned that a concept to be acceptable over other previous
									concepts must explain more than the predecessors... all of which you ridiculed.
									No in the seventh paragraph I find you do the same thing... offering superior explanation...
									but no proof.
								</p>
								<p>
									You list three ways in which questions are answered--- item "C" seems to infer that
									which Aquinas inferred a long time ago... that a finite mind will never perceive
									the infinite. This I suggested in my earlier letters when you claimed to know this
									"ONE".
								</p>
								<p>
									What do you think of Van der Leeuw's "Conquest of Illusion," or have your read it?
									Mac loaned me a copy, and then I bought one myself when I was in N.Y.C.
								</p>
								<p>
									How do you know that the men in the Perennial Philosophy are genuinely awakened?
									There are so many major items of which you are not sure... men whom you have met
									even.
								</p>
								<p>
									The greatest difficulty I have with you is trying to put you in a category... and
									you do not help much. Let me ask you for the reasons for your interest in other
									people.... is this some sort of law which must be followed, or do you expect further
									help for helping others?
								</p>

									Sincerely,
