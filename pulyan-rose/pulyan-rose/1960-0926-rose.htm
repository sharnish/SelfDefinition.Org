								<p class="salutation">
									Hello A.P.
								</p>
								<p>
									It's hard to write anything and be aware that each word you write is rooted in egocentricity. And of course I am a little confused by some factors (whether interior, exterior, yours or mine it matters not which, nor whether I seek to escape in the confusion). I am used to writing to people who flatter one another if for no other reason that to avoid the misunderstanding that generally comes from reading in meanings in letters other than meant.
								</p>
								<p>
									Up until now (your last letter) our correspondence consisted of you saying "Rose make a statement". Followed by A.P. retorting you are full of bologna... it is a product of ego-fat. This process must either bear fruit or wear itself out.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I was in college I started out with the faith that with my reason I would unravel the Gordian knot. I went about making girls weep with dialectical attack, and analytical affront. I took a heavy science course. And numbers.
								</p>
								<p>
									As I got older, I began to feel that science is like the snake with the tail in its mouth. (All this talk is to keep you off my back you will say.) Systematic knowledge is circuitous, and by appearing to be circular seems to be perfect, but it really never goes anywhere. So I started to ignore the work of the mathematician and spent years with the systems of thinking that actually could not validate by reason, but which appealed to my intuition (subtle ego?).
								</p>
								<p>
									In both cases we get weary. I could see that it would take a century or more for me to cut the Gordian knot with the analysis of atoms or brain synapses. I saw other people clinging to rationalizations that I had recognized and discarded, so knew that the present fad or intuition-path might later be discarded for one more appealing.
								</p>
								<p>
									In readings, on yoga and by Ouspensky and others, we find this business of the ego as an interfering deterrent. I know that a man has many faces and should get rid of all but one. (It has never occurred to me to think that there should be less than one.) Of course we may have trouble getting rid of all the faces if we cannot determine which is the false face and which is the real.
								</p>
								<p>
									After a while we either make decisions or fusion mounts. We cannot follow both science and intuition. By that I mean that we cannot devote all our time to studying science, and at the same time devote all of our time to studying yoga. So we either focus on one with a little eye on the other or we plan more than we can undertake and get confused and drift away from both.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another thing I notice as time accumulates. I have built in a sort of safety valve, from too much pressure. When things material upset me I tend to walk away mentally, while pursuing the thing I do not want upset.
								</p>
								<p>
									Like wanting to shoot the crooked cop on the corner. You may well believe that the world will be better and safer for the children without the cop, and you will be able to live in dignity and respect until they electrocute you at least... but you worry about what will happen to the kid after you go. And you walk away mentally from mayhem. The same with this business of soulseeking.
								</p>
								<p>
									We may have assurance that children are born of ego. Along comes a teacher who says,&ndash;go up on the hill and build an altar and sacrifice your child (ego?). We cannot do it even though the same child is a liability because of deeply ingrained patterns.
								</p>
								<p>
									Long before I married I know that man made love only to himself. I senses that pleasure was imaginative... but imagination may well be the matrix of creation.
								</p>
								<p>
									You become confused and in the mental welter one day say, "Oh, what the hell. I could be kidding myself either way." How do I know whether I am less a pawn, by either method,-doing or not doing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thus the dilemma here. I sincerely wish to be ONE. I do not sincerely wish to be none or nothing. I may sense intuitively that I am nothing, but there is a loud whisper from the pretended void that says, "Don't worry old man, something can never desire to be nothing. You are at least a fact."
								</p>
								<p>
									Now to go on and say "How do you know you are a fact. How do you know you know. How do you know you. How do you know anything. Give it another turn... "All this chatter is to keep from really thinking. This is clever chatter to show that you know how to be complicated. Give it still another turn... And all of this is further proud chatter to pretend that Ego 1 has got the bead on Ego 2.
								</p>
								<p>
									And where does it get you? "So what!" soon becomes the least common denominator.
								</p>
								<p>
									Are we not to have any attachment? Should we take a gun and blow our brains out to show our non-attachment for life?
								</p>
								<p>
									I know nothing about God. Or god. How can I when I do not really know what I am or if I am? At this point it seems difficult for me to know something as meaningless and meaningful as God until I know my own limitations.
								</p>
								<p>
									I want to know the Truth. And if the Truth is that man has no existence after Death I will still work toward understanding that. But I will not live with any great enthusiasm. I will not care if I have then thousand egos. In other words, I think, that until we have exhausted the last faculties of knowledge, it would be foolish to take someone else's word for it that there is a God and that that God wanted us to give up our craving for survival... for that craving in itself may well be the needed factor for survival.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another point and then I will shut up. In correspondence we must either have words or no words. We must have definitions or no definitions. I can say ub-glub. And how far will we get? You mentioned in the beginning that you hoped for not too much "back and forth wrangle". You also mention that the M usually knows "That one too." Now you propose that I write something besides ub-glub so that we can have something to wrangle about.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you say that the M knows that one too, then I presume that anything I might say would be superfluous. So I keep my words to a minimum. I am not tempted with the prospects of knowing God by your aid because I do not know what you are talking about. You do not define It or it. I do understand that you may be trying to clarify my thinking processes so that I can think or know something, and I will appreciate this if that is the aim.
								</p>
								<p>
									You speak of money. Houses. A farm. A wife. What will happen to them when the universe goes up in smoke?
								</p>
								<p>
									I know very little about Zen. I have a book here about it. It makes no sense to me (The book, not Zen.) I do not know what you mean by guarantee. Guarantee that they are telling you the truth? That you will be awakened,&ndash;that you will know something meaning everything? Encountered one Master (Hindu) who would put me on the same frequency with the eternal one, and would guarantee me within three incarnations to awaken me forever. Rather embarrassing though when we start asking for definitions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanking you for your efforts,
								</p>
