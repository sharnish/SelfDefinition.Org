									Friend Pulyan -
								</p>
								<p>
									In answer to your checked items---regards the Hindu Master. He is not, was not my
									master, as I had not sufficient time to study whether he or his antagonistic opponents
									were the true descendent (legal) of the original Master of that line. <sup>[1]</sup>
									A schism left about ten groups each proclaiming to be "it". So much for the reservations
									of which you asked.
								</p>
								<p class="fnote">
									[1. A Rhada Soami sect.]</p>
								<p>
									What attracted me to the final group I met was a hunch that the whole idea behind
									the concentration (adoration) on a human figure may well amount to creation (via
									matrix of many human minds = imagination) of lasting existence for the master---
									who in turn drags his initiates over behind him. This hunch came from sifting (for
									a least common denominator) through many of the world's religions. Kriya yoga.
								</p>
								<p>
									As to the latter two checked items I will answer them jointly. I know that you expect
									me to sense your value but I have no way of knowing much. As you need material (talk)
									for what you call "transmission". I also need material to get a vague idea of what
									is expected and what your are trying to put across. I have asked you some questions
									in reaction to certain statements you have made. I realize that facts may have no
									bearing upon your transmission but it will help to determine some eagerness in your
									direction.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now I know that (you) are complex -- much more so than myself -- and you know that
									I have no way of knowing much more than that. I must reiterate that I have no great
									eagerness to bandy endless words (although they many show how complicated we are)---if
									there is no objective.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Change-over" to what?
								</p>
								<p>
									I do not doubt your sincerity but if I read you literally and read it as given in
									sincerity -- then there is no use worrying about anything.
								</p>
								<p>
									You do however mention reincarnation. Gautama Buddha (according to what I have read)
									referred to re-birth. What do you mean by reincarnation? Re-occurrence? Do you believe
									in reincarnation? Do you believe it as a "theory-most-probable" or do you have an
									ability to remember? When a person awakens, is he aware of such incarnations?
								</p>
								<p>
									You ask me to define several words. There can be no feeling, intuition or imagination
									until the feeler, intuiter and imaginator are known. (Really pretzeled that one).
								</p>
								<p>
									I am not so curious to investigate your teaching as I am to understand you. Understanding
									(God-damned or otherwise is all I know) <sup>[2]</sup> may well be the kind of friendship
									that will account for confidence. Friendship must have some definition else we can
									dispense with the word. It is hard to pin attitudes down or diagnose from ink.
								</p>
