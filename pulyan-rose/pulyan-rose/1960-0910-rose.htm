									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									It is strange that the forgetting of the enclosed stamped envelope should fire you up so. I forgot it. With one voice you tell me that we are equals, friends, and that you have no system. When you ORDER me to enclose the stamp then immediately you institute a SYSTEM of discipline.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let's take this business of dialectics. And your attacking each word I write, plus each one that I do not write... If we are to write letters we are going to use words, and there is hardly a word or sentence that is uttered that cannot be rooted in egotism or one of the basic appetites of man. Again I say, what type of correspondence do you wish to carry on? I do not think it necessary for me to call you a "lousy s. of a b." just to convince you that I am being honest. If you do not wish me to express egotism, it is better that I say nothing but thanks.
								</p>
								<p>
									There is only one way to avoid dialectics that I can see, and that is to listen. I have no desire to be other than honest and friendly. I can only be as friendly to you as understanding will allow me... I have little to do with it.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have nothing to explain, and you have everything to explain that your propose. I am not the giver of knowledge, but the receiver. You infer that you have something gigantic to offer but you do not tell me what. So I can only wait and see. I shall not fail to find the Truth any more than Truth shall fail to find me. If you cannot communicate with me and get your message (or whatever it is) across, then you shall fail. And if God is the thing to be found, then God shall fail, not me. Taking any popular definition of the word God, God would be more able to find me than I, Him. If nobody worships God (if that is what He wants) then that is his fault because He is in the superior position.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now I would like to be your friend, and I would like to get "the message" whatever it is, but all this calls for more words. You deplore words, and neglect to answer questions, but give me lamentation for not using words without first defining them. And if we define them we are using dialectics, evasive tactics, piddling, or whatnot.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am an ignorant man. If I am too ignorant, it will be up to you to throw up my case. I have tried to make my life a vector realization of the Truth or growing into being. I will probably write as long as you continue to answer. You make a mistake in thinking I will kiss anyone's posterior for a nebulous value. And if I were to assert that you had anything for sure to offer it would be dishonest, and you would know it because I really know very little about anything much less everything about you. In order to know whether you are an enlightened one, I would first have to know what your qualifications of an "Enlightened One" are, and still would have to experience all that you have before crediting your honesty,-(true knowledge).
								</p>
								<p>
									If you know God as well as you would know a man, then ask him all about Richard Rose, and ask him to give Richard the power to understand his other friend Pulyan... if He thinks it is asking too much to just enlighten me to a point where knowing one thing I will know all things, and will not have to use limitless verbal levers to pry the degree of ignorance from all fraternal vegetables.
								</p>
								<p>
									.....</p>
								<p>
									I have but one question this time (it is hard for me to create argument material which you so well enjoy).
								</p>
								<p>
									What do you know about this business of translation? I run into a person occasionally who claims it is the only immortality.
								</p>
								<p>
									Are you by any chance a masochist... getting a titillation from someone calling you names.
								</p>
								<p>
									You command me to write immediately, and "Immediately" does not give me much time to dream up what your friendship really requires.
								</p>
								<p>
									Or let us put it this way, I have already said too much, even by my own standards, and I cannot live up to yours until I know what yours are.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many of the things you say to me I have said to others, excepting that I have never made claims to having the Truth.
								</p>
								<p>
									What would you have me do?
								</p>
