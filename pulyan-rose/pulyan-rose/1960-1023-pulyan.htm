							<p class="salutation">
								Dear Dick,
							</p>
							<p>
								Call the object of our discussion the "One" if you like -- it has nothing to do
								with your frenzied semantics. <em>All</em> the people you mention have only a <em>fancied</em>
								referent &amp; <em>must be completely disregarded</em>. If they are cuckoo there
								is no reason for you to be. I thought I <em>had</em> dealt with "God"!
							</p>
							<p>
								Do <em>not</em> concentrate on the high-colored (&amp; rather delightful) <em>stylization</em>
								of Zen. Beneath that there is <em>serious "work</em>" done.
							</p>
							<p>
								As regards "experiences" Bucke mentions many of course. That type may have differing
								results. One person may guard it as a jealous secret all his or her life &amp; as
								the most wonderful thing. On the other hand Sir Julian Huxley, who is a high-type
								"humanist," may have several such experiences and <em>regard them as purely subjective</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								They are not rare. They <em>are</em> "valid" (not subjective) but having one does
								<em>not</em> enable one to <em>prove</em> their validity. Sir Julian Huxley is an
								obvious case in point. They can come to anyone.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>They</em> are discussed fairly often, but there seems almost a conspiracy of
								silence about the "understanding" <em>we</em> are dealing with in these letters
								-- because for one thing it is quite rare -- and for another the words "an experience"
								do not properly describe such a fundamental revelation and discovery. Have you read
								what the <em>Upanishads</em> for example say about it? (There is a pocket-book on
								them.)
							</p>
							<p>
								I am not "<em>threatening</em> to drop your case" but rather aware that you do not
								even show verbal desire for this thing -- and many do. Further you must believe
								that, without any desire to press this upon you, I am actuated <em>only</em> by
								consideration for you, because life can be rough. If there is nothing in you that
								wants it you cannot blame me for the obvious realization that we would not get anywhere,
								except to recrimination &amp; that is undesirable. All through the ages misguided
								followers of "awakened" men filled with zeal have endeavored by assertions of miracles
								&amp; marvels to boost their master's reputation -- and actually such things are
								beside the point.
							</p>
							<p>
								Zen says that to desire miracles is to try to put another head
								<!-- -->
								<!-- end page 1 of letter, sheet numbered 67 -->
								<!-- this letter is only 2 pages -->
								<!-- start page 2 of letter, sheet numbered 68 -->
								<!-- -->
								over your own. In plain English the marvel is to be found in what we are already
								familiar with, writing a letter or drinking a glass of water -- in the so-called
								"commonplace."
							</p>
							<p>
								Naturally I want your photograph -- is that such a terrible request? Did I send
								you mine? If not I will at once do so. Or is there some special reason, as was the
								case with a lady student of mine who was terribly disfigured in an accident?
							</p>
							<p>
								Friendship is desirable in a study of this type because the delicate discrimination
								required is not attainable in an atmosphere of cynical distrust, picayune carping
								and falsetto accusations. Even a psychical researcher gets further if he approaches
								this often murky subject in a pleasant manner. But leave this matter for the moment.
							</p>
							<p>
								The experiences <em>you</em> mention come unasked &amp; unexpected. They leave the
								ego the same as before, almost.
							</p>
							<p>
								The understanding we are dealing with <em>demands</em> an abnegation of ego,* even
								if only <em>once</em>, yet completely. This is for us humans usually a real problem.
								For me it was nearly impossible. The friend who is assisting you (as a sort of catalyst)
								does not have a pleasant job because ego starts a furious battle by any &amp; every
								method, tricky, snide, violent, withdrawing &amp; so forth. (The same is true in
								psychotherapy but it is <em>diluted</em> so that the ego doesn't get so inflamed.
								It is "diluted" because the "attack" on ego is slow, long drawn-out, gradual, gentle
								-- and highly profitable!)
							</p>
							<p>
								(* You will find this exemplified in the remarks of every sage through the ages
								-- &amp; I will instance Heraclitus, Gautama, Lao Tse --- all around <span style="white-space: nowrap;">
									500 BC</span> when there was such an abrupt change from the (evolved) animistic
								&amp; sacrificial cults, as dealt with by Fraser &amp; other anthropologists.)
							</p>
							<p>
								You will <em>never</em> while you live find any <em>other</em> "way," since intellect
								alone cannot do the job &amp; only revolves in its own squirrel-cage.
							</p>
							<p>
								You will <em>never</em> find a teacher-friend who will let <em>you</em> fix the
								conditions of "work" because then you are using your ego to work on ego &amp; that
								is self-defeating.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is how it is. I cannot change it. It is an "odd" universe you &amp; I are born
								in &amp; will die in.
