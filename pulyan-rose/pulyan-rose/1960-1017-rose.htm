									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									It is possible that I have too strong an aversion to the use of the word "God".
									From my early youth I built up a sort of anger with the pretenders, who mouth it
									too easily. I felt that the ignorance of hungry students was often perpetuated by
									wind-bags with a facility for getting into the act. My father-in-law is a minister
									who is a personal friend of "God's". He has learned to distinguish God's voice from
									the devil's. They talk together like two chums in a pub. And I know another guy
									who claims he is Jesus Christ. Not too long ago he wrote me a letter saying now
									that he was not sure if he were God the son or God the father. So there is an "open
									season" on God by petty squawkers and confidence men who would avoid gross sales
									tax or the postal regulations.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have a deep respect for those who do not try to label. As the Jews perhaps with
									IHVH. I think if I actually did experience what I consider from this angle to be
									the sum total I would devise another symbol... and while losing a little mantra-magic
									gain in meaning by differentiation from the God of the minister's vest-pocket, and
									the phallic gods of old.
								</p>
								<p>
									You used a word which to an English speaking person (Christian origin) implies personality
									by omniscience, and omnipresence. And the essence of this entity (in reality the
									personalized total ignorance of mankind to date) has been vaingloriously blue-printed
									by the summa theology of Aquinas. And it still means nothing to me... except an
									answer created by heat and hunger.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have an added difficulty in our correspondence. I would have been more insistent
									upon definition at the early outset, but I had heard that Zen is full of shocks
									and gimmicks, and I waited a while to see if you were doing something for effect.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many would rush to you when you use the word God, because it is a great door-opener...
									especially when they claim to know all about God. But these fundamentalists are
									all madly chopping at each other with the sword that Christ left behind...on the
									other hand I think a genuinely honest man would be inclined to avoid you when you
									make your fist claim. And of course your sifting may be the aim... but what does
									it leave you?
								</p>
								<p>
									Your letter is still evasive to a degree (although I am deeply grateful for the
									volume and labor on your part). You speak of me not being fit to know life after
									death until I know all about life. It is impossible to know about life until one
									knows about death. And I think you know that. Still bicameral and polar.
								</p>
								<p>
									We only know a thing by that which it is not. There is no positive definition alone.
									We can say that Is-ness is Is-ness, but only a many speaking from essence would
									understand essence.
								</p>
								<p>
									Do not think I am quibbling. You invited reasonable argument. I think all argument
									is a waste of time, reasonable or not. If it is necessary or "transmission" then
									I will try to put up a pretence of argument, and try to be reasonable even if it
									is painful. But now you hint that maybe we should discontinue this attempt to awaken
									me. I will leave it up to your superior wisdom, and will quit writing when you say,
									or when you quit writing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Either we use reason or we do not. My hunches tell me that we will not get far with
									reason. But this is your idea. Mine would be to talk to you a few days and let the
									intuition add up something. When I suggested this you replied that my self-invitation
									was "almost connubial". I can tolerate that crack if it was meant to be an insult
									to irritate, but if it was meant sincerely... then there is only one other way to
									communicate and that is written words with written definitions, and is surely does
									not make a bit of difference how I look.
								</p>
								<p>
									I would like to summarize my thinking or attitude in this way... I think you have
									had an experience. Perhaps such as mention in Bucke's book on cosmic consciousness.
									Perhaps even greater. But how am I to know. My recognized position is that of a
									germ in a windstorm. I am too small to be terrorized by the windstorm... besides
									I have learned that if the germ wants to learn anything or be anything fear will
									avail nothing. So you may as well know, I fear neither you nor the windstorm. When
									you threaten to drop my case you are counting on my fear of extinction... and my
									greed for a crumb. (This is the old "drop pigeon" game,&ndash;a hint of great savings
									in minimal investments).
								</p>
								<p>
									There is still another discrepancy. You keep maintaining a desire for "friendship".
									Now by the last definition "it is the transmission". You cannot expect me to know
									about that. And on the other hand, after the transmission, I presume there should
									be no doubt of my friendship for you and all men of like effort. (Evidently Christ
									failed to transmit to the apostles.)
								</p>
								<p>
									Until such time as I am favored with this transcendental friendship, the most I
									try to live up to is that known to other germs like myself. The most you can expect
									from me is human friendship, and it exists only in mutual reciprocity. You are really
									demanding when you expect a person to understand you enough to want to obey every
									unexplained order without better understanding than a scribbled line permits...
									while you (who should know all about all including me) have need of a picture.
								</p>
								<p>
									I can do thing without any hesitation for no reason at all... if asked,----but am
									generally reluctant to be ordered about under the guise of a reasonable reason that
									is really not commensurate with what my peanut brain considers common sense. I found
									this attitude necessary in dealing with certain cults that used a certain dialectic
									to obligate all sorts of things including all wealth... and this by mail alone.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am ignorant. I seen to sense or know it, but I, know my limitations, know also
									that you know about it. Like the pie man and Simple Simon... it is not enough just
									to brow-beat me into accepting the pie-man's claims.
								</p>
								<p>
									Humility may well be needed to take great strides, but we must know is what direction.
									Inverting the head in the first dung-heap would be aimless humility, and in all
									possibility,--rewardless. Beating our head against a wall or gazing at the sun until
									we go blind may be good implements for attaining... but we had better make real
									sure that we have some insurance that we are going to attain. We may need the eyes
									to look elsewhere.
								</p>
								<p>
									My insurance was my intuition... fat-headed, or imperfects as it might be. And my
									intuition required that I personally meet and talk with you. Your crude and almost
									vulgar reaction was supposed to be licensed by Zen and your unchallengeable understanding
									of my "egotistical motives". Maybe so, but you still paint an egotistical picture
									to me by your highhanded analysis of me that indicated with only a few words but
									which now is left wanting for want of a photograph.
								</p>
								<p>
									Come now, why should this all be so one-sided? Do you really want friendship or
									sycophancy?
								</p>
