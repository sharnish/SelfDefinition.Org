								Dear Dick,

								<em>VITAMIN C</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								Would still feel inclined to "fill up" with Vit. C. Say 4 of the 500 USP units tablets
								as indicated &amp; for a few days until the "lemonade" color of the urine shows the
								system is "full." Only A &amp; D seem to have side-effects &amp; those only in very abnormally
								high dosages, so the C can be taken safely -- at least I have found it so &amp; a friend.
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>REASON</em>!
							</div>
							<p>
								Do not preen yourself too much on being "logical." Much else enters into your "reasoning"
								which at times resembles the absurdities a poor subject of post-hypnotic suggestion
								has to emit! Suppose he is told he will take his pants down (in company) at a certain
								gesture -- &amp; it is given. He must say "This may seem startling to you, but I feel
								the heat &amp; although you may be shocked in appearance I know it is not real, &amp; consequently
								I propose to remove my pants at this time. Let us all show our independence of conventional
								behavior ---" &amp; so forth.
							</p>
							<p>
								Logic is all very well for a time, but at any real problem or obstacle emotionally
								affecting you out comes the "to hell with you, this is what I think, &amp; I don't care
								what you say."

								Actually we "SWEEP THINGS UNDER THE RUG" you know. In the last century there was
								a mechanico-materialistic attitude which seemed very solid &amp; comforting, hard little
								particles, fixed laws; even "chance" obeyed laws, &amp; evolution "showed" how life
								&amp;, later, consciousness evolved from, respectively, the mud and the monkey, at least
								it was assumed it was only a matter of time. (They hoped.) There was another "gap"
								at the vertebrates too. Certainly no need for the God-hypothesis, or any form of
								teleology <sup>[1]</sup> so hateful to research. But now space is finite but recurves
								in the fourth dimension, two electrons are "wavicles," wave-particles, and, when
								they meet, require six dimensions, also if one knows their velocity one cannot know
								their <span class="nowrap">position --</span> and vice versa. Anti-matter has arrived,
								negative "being"! The concept of consciousness or self has remained inscrutable
								&amp; "cause," "time," "infinity" we sweep under the rug with horror in our adolescence.

								Such concepts are the opposite of clarity, reality, definiteness, &amp; arise when we
								<em>play at the edge of our playground</em>. In other words, obfuscation is as natural
								to mind as clarity. But <em>neither</em> of these applies to the "awakened" person
								who is aware of that which is beyond <em>both</em> reason and imagination. However
								reason grows from experience, not experience from reason. D.T. Suzuki told the Japanese
								Emperor on April 23, 1946 that "we all, Buddhists as well as Christians, living
								as we do on the plane of the intellect, submit everything to intellectual test and
								domination, and reject as unworthy of consideration all that the intellect fails
								to understand." <sup>[2]</sup>

							<p>
								The "scientific world" is pre-eminently the world of the intellect. However this
								is a world of postulates &amp; abstractions &amp; concepts -- <em>remote from reality</em>
								&amp; <em>constantly changing</em>. Electricity, matter, mass, time, space, (curved
								space!), force, etc. etc. are high-order abstractions derived from postulates which
								lead to other postulates &amp; so back to experience (like pointer-readings, scintillations
								etc.).
							</p>
							<p>
								They are "sufficient" until proved wrong. The "<em>personal world</em>" is quite
								different. This consists of <em>things for which there is NO "reason"</em>, which
								<em>cannot be described</em>, <em>which science cannot handle</em>, such as <em>colors</em>
								(quite indescribable &amp; nothing like the postulated "vibrations in the ether"), <em>sounds</em>
								(nothing like air compression &amp; rarification), <em>emotions</em>, <em>feelings</em>,
								<em>affection</em>, <em>smell</em> (nothing like the small particles thrown off
								by objects), <em>touch</em> (a diffused indescribable sense, if it is a sense),
								<em>mind</em> (psychology deals with everything BUT its subject-matter! e.g. behavior,
								reaction-times, etc.--- &amp; never <em>directly</em> with the strange "nature" of the
								mental side of our organism). There is a variable personal "time" which allows of
								no measurement also. There is "consciousness" &amp; scientists quietly assume this,
								until a blow on the head, or a sleeping pill removes the whole Universe in a split
								second!
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>These two worlds</em> are assumed by Bertrand Russell to have a one-one correspondence.
								But further than that no man goeth. (We do not even know we see the <em>same</em>
								colors &amp; hear the <em>same</em> sounds -- as for example A<sup style="color: inherit">b</sup>
								or C<sup style="color: inherit">#</sup>.

								"Reason" even if it were as cold as a calculating machine with <em>no</em> prejudices
								&amp; errors punched on our memory-card (and there are plenty!) is only half the equipment
								of an integrated person. In Buddhism, the show-piece of the pimply-adolescent-intellectual,
								there is nevertheless both Mahaprajna, the Great Wisdom, &amp; Mahakaruna, the Great
								Compassion and these are not two but one &amp; flow into one another. "The highest reality"
								-- I quote a Buddhist, Suzuki -- "is
								<!-- asterisk here -->
								NOT A MERE ABSTRACTION, it is VERY MUCH ALIVE WITH SENSE AND INTELLIGENCE, and above
								all, with love purged of human infirmities and defilements." <span style="font-size: 140%;">
									*</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								Sounds like "religion" doesn't it. Bambinos with starched embroidery &amp; laces, electric
								prayer wheels, consecrated wafers, bloody wine, priests, ministers, saints, devils,
								rabbis, men with clothes reversed &amp; bits of their epidermis "sacredly" removed,
								black meteoric stones, rosaries, patient men with big red hearts on the outside,
								tambourines, drums, mighty <span class="nowrap">Wurlitzers, ---</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								But, <em>as it happens</em>, it is true. (I refer to the paragraph marked <span style="font-size: 150%;
                                    position: relative; top: 0.4rem;">*</span>.) <em>You</em> cannot "pin down"
								an experience &amp; I cannot properly describe it, &amp; if I could, it would not do the
								vital thing -- <em>produce it in you</em>. That needs special techniques, <em>continual
									squawks from you</em> &amp; gray hairs for me.
							</p>
							<p>
								I could not describe a blue flower to a blind man -- he could feel its shape &amp; texture,
								that is all. Would he feel annoyed at not "pinning me down"?
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>Who is it then?</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								The "madball" is <em>not I</em>. I was educated as a mathematician at college, became
								a public accountant &amp; worked on some of the biggest projects including UNRRA, became
								an executive, office manager, assistant <span class="nowrap">treasurer ---</span>
								I was always very skeptical &amp; hard-headed. My mind "contains" yours actually, although
								you <em>could</em> reach the same position of course [if] we <em>were</em> trying
								to do this. We are not unlike a man &amp; quite a young child.

								I am <em>not</em> driving at "mysticism." It is <em>as it happens a valid glimpse</em>
								of the One Self mentioned above, BUT I am driving at this IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND,
								freely available for experiment &amp; consideration, <em>not</em> as a glimpse but <em>fully</em>
								&amp; for days &amp; weeks, <em>not</em> lost in semi-conscious ecstasy but in calm appreciation
								of the greatest mystery life has to offer. Like seeing a joke suddenly or leaping
								to a conclusion ----

								The truth does not permeate all religions except in such fantastic disguise that
								its own father wouldn't know it. Suppose truth is a rabbit. This rabbit is in a
								field -- a large field. Round the field are very high walls -- creeds and dogma!
								So -- find your damn rabbit!! And remember <em>the rabbit knows your thoughts</em>
								&amp; so as you resolve to go one way to catch it, it knows &amp; evades you!
							</p>
							<p>
								Or -- another analogy ---- all religions are <em>degenerated</em> versions of the
								things the founder said, (such as Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tse, etc. etc.), altered, added
								to, twisted &amp; so forth, and <em>COMPLETELY USELESS</em> because every time the founder
								opened his blessed mouth he put his blessed foot in it, AND HE KNEW IT (THE BUDDHA
								SAID AS MUCH). If then the TRUE WORDS of the founder are NO DAMN GOOD what is the
								good of the DECAYED VERSION CALLED A RELIGION?

								Freud or Jung won't cure you!! Don't come back with a wearisome spiel about psychoanalysis
								-- I ONLY USE IT AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF A RELATIONSHIP OF ONE MASTER TO A PUPIL.
								"No man can serve two masters." And no master can serve 1000 pupils EXCEPT ONE BY

								I was smarter than you. I SAW WHERE THE SHOE PINCHED. I saw that I had to do something
								that reason could not do because it could never understand ITSELF! There was a <em>bear
									in the cave</em>, and I had to get him out &amp; could only use tricks &amp; persuasion
								until he decided to waddle out! I saw there was a <em>DILEMMA</em>. I saw that my
								egocentric position was in the way of a universal understanding but how could <em>I</em>
								resolve not to decide as <em>I</em> usually does -- it was like lifting myself off
								the floor, or a knife cutting itself. So I considered the matter warily.

								However the prescription (what to do) is as old as the human race. Find a guru --
								&amp; it wasn't easy. I tried Nikhilananda, <sup>[3]</sup> a splendid man &amp; a swami
								in the Ramakrishna mission on New York's East Side. Also Yoshikawa, <sup>[4]</sup>
								a Buddhist priest at the temple not too far away from the previous Hindu, but this
								time a Japanese of course. Also a Taoist, "in the succession," certainly "awakened"
								and well received in the temples in Japan of Zen. He was a European. None of these
								did the trick because I was &amp; am far more obstinate &amp; pig-headed even than you (and
								that's saying a lot).

								One day investigating a new psychotherapy I met a very self-possessed young lady,
								married, cheerful --- I spoke to her &amp; then tried all my intellectual equipment
								(apart from skepticism you haven't exhibited much actual knowledge yet by the way)
								-- the philosophers, scientists &amp; so forth (like you I was stuffed to the gills
								with other people's ideas &amp; as proud as a peacock, "we think," "we say," "we believe"
								-- boy, was I a stinkeroo) ---

							<p>
								She handled these very easily. Compared to me she was deep water, deeper than my
								sonic apparatus could register. Could she be deeper than Vedanta, Shin-shu, Taoism,
								Zen?? I was incredulous, but it has worked out. One day I may continue this -- if

								Why do you persist in <em>trying</em> to compass by the intellect what is the one
