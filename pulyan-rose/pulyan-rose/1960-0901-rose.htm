									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									Much of what you say strikes me favorable. Many of your inferences seem designed to evaluate my reaction to you.
								</p>
								<p>
									What would you have me say?
								</p>
								<p>
									I agree that real friendship may well consist of a relationship where neither is too easily offended. I feel sure that I will not be ungrateful to a process that enhances, but know also that I cannot predict what I might do if I met a black leopard on the stairs.
								</p>
								<p>
									It may be difficult to be totally honest... I have corresponded with so many who required (or so I thought) that carefulness of handling. You may have to ease into their acquaintanceship if you do not wish to offend, because some are offended if you have an opposite opinion.
								</p>
								<p>
									In my correspondence with one "authority", I was informed that it is not of much value to attack the edges of a concept. "It is necessary, before judging, to know all that the teacher knows and more before judging."
								</p>
								<p>
									What do you mean, "We are equal". Is everyone?
								</p>
								<p>
									I cannot predict. I must know a lot more about you before I form any opinions. I presume you have some system whereby you hope for me to know more about knowing. Am in a sort of weary funk right now from trying to analyze the many theories and concepts.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am curious to know what the point is, i.e., what is to be gained, if body and mind both disappear. Is your process the development of another faculty? If it is just the knowledge of our own nothingness, then what is to be gained by knowing something of nothingness?
								</p>
								<p>
									What are your plans for the future?
								</p>
								<p>
									Incidentally, I know the detriment of trying to convey anything (which may well have to be conveyed intuitively) by mail. If you wish I can visit you. I am going to the heart of things as quickly as possible.
								</p>
								<p>
									Will appreciate information about the aims of your system,-(and the mechanism).
								</p>
								<p class="signature">
									Sincerely,
								</p>

									Richard
