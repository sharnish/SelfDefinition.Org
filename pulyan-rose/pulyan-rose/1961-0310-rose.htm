									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									Concerning the volume of conversation... I do not know what this whole thing is
									about and you do. Consequently your are the one with the foot on brake or accelerator.
									You have convinced me that my own knowledge is insufficient (you and many years
									of experience). And if I have no intellectual tidbits to offer, what is the use
									or verbiage? But you need it you tell me to implement something that you cannot
									explain to me.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am not fascinated with the need to pay 25 or 50 anythings to a psychiatrist. My
									studies along those lines indicate that they are laboring under and belaboring the
									public with some very erroneous ideas. By organization they have managed to cement
									themselves into a sinecure, and like most professionals they cow the layman with
									a solemn look of authoritativeness which is their chief stock in trade. Percentage-wise
									among my contacts the head-shrinkers have the greatest representation among the
									nutty. Poetic justice perhaps for the pose. The only reason I mention this is because
									of your frequent reference to your values as a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist uses
									as a yardstick for sanity, that which is done by the most people, and calls it "the
									Normal". Using this yardstick, he is instrumental in sending men to the gallows,
									because the solemn hypocrisy of the lawyer-racket recognizes another good con man.
									In my opinion, (be it humble or asinine) the average psychiatrist uses word-symbols
									as many a physician used Latin in his prescriptions... to conceal his own ignorance
									and confuse the victim.
								</p>
								<p>
									I would like to comment on three stages toward awakening. I have become dissatisfied
									and argued that someone must have more direct knowledge. Huxley does not inspire
									me. He seemed afraid to say something that might interfere with the sale of his
									book.
								</p>
								<p>
									Sure the idea of a teacher comes up. I have eagerly sought people out who were only
									considered to be intellectuals, to share ideas or to lever out new coordinations
									with the spark of their conversation. And they are teacher to a certain extent.
									But I do not run madly from one cult to another. I have looked into them, but when
									they want me to pledge ten or twenty years of my time to buying their mumbo-jumbo,
									I became interested in another direction.
								</p>
								<p>
									When we use the word guru there is a slightly different implication... either more
									glamorous or pretentious since the word is exotic, or more full of meaning since
									the Hindu putting more meaning into theology enables us to put more meaning into
									the word game. And to expect more meaningfulness from the guru.
								</p>
								<p>
									You tell me that I must dip one toe in, or accept the theory or doctrine. What theory?
									What doctrine?
								</p>
								<p>
									To summarize our difficulty to date... I have a vague idea of a system which is
									not a system that will however work if I do what you tell me. So I search the realm
									of possibility and (almost like Alice in Wonderland trying to REALize the make-believe)
									and concede that there might be wisdom behind such a suggestion.
								</p>
								<p>
									How will a man know a teacher? ... perhaps when he is one. But there is a system
									practiced by nearly everyone seeking information. There is little that is factual,
									most knowledge is conceptual. A new concept must either offer considerable data
									to indicate other concepts insufficient, or explain a vaster amount of previously
									unexplained (phenomena or other).
								</p>
								<p>
									In my search for knowledge and a wiser associate or contact, I have used or found
									myself using a sieve or sorts. I looked for certain least common denominators, and
									then for the reasons for those selected. To shorten this harangue for an instance,
									I have been attracted to several that do not promise conscious exit from this life...
									mainly because I have twice become unconscious and close to the exit and came back
									with no memories of bugles or angels (or any).
								</p>
								<p>
									One Hindu group (who have a Master (whatever that might be)) admits that our senses
									lessen with the lessening of the body but that we are able to attach ourselves to
									a "Sound Current" by certain practices, which we may follow at death through several
									celestial regions (from which come reincarnation only) to still higher contact with
									God and union with God. Hence my question about the sound current. Nothing to do
									with the Shaver mystery. <sup>[1]</sup> Blavatsky has a little book "The Voice of
									the Silence." Supposed to be the same as the Logos. Music of the spheres, etc.

								</p>
								<p>
									Of course I am interested to what my destiny is. And you are loath to delineate
									that which you claim to know.
								</p>
								<p>
									If yours is a strong desire to exit, what prevents you from suicide? Are those other
									little egos so valuable?
								</p>
								<p>
									Yes I have changed... but I do not know if your ink was the catalyst. Unless you
									could have managed to kill a couple people very close to me... by mail. The real
									"I" never changes I have heard... so I have no testimonials to offer.
