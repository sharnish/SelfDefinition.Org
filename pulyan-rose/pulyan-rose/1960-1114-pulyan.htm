								Dear Dick,
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>ZEN</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								Forget about me for the sake of argument for the moment. Take a Zen Master.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sokatsu Shaku on his seventieth birthday (April 16, 1939) said that in his <em>40</em>
								years of teaching <em>3,000</em> men &amp; women came to study Zen. In the 40 years
								only <em>13</em> completed the training &amp; of these only 4 became teachers in
								turn.
							</p>
							<p>
								These 4 were Zuizan Goto, Eisan Tatsuta, Chikudo Ohasama and Sokei-An (who "worked"
								in New York &amp; founded "The First Zen Institute" <sup class="black">*</sup> which still exists -- the Zen
								Master there now is Miura Roshi).
							</p>
							<p class="note80">* <a href="first-zen-institute-sokei-an-website-contact-info.htm">first-zen-institute-sokei-an-website-contact-info.htm</a></p>
							<p>
								These 4 men were remarkable men. I know several persons who knew <em>Sokei-An</em>
								(See "Cat's Yawn," fairly easily obtainable -- a reprint of issues of a magazine
								published by &amp; written by Sokei-An). <sup>[1]</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. Already footnoted in Pulyan's letter of Sep 23, 1960, in the appendix <a href="http://viking/pulyan/letters/1960-0923-pulyan.htm#personality-of-the-master">
									Personality of the Master</a>&nbsp;]
							</p>
							<p>
								As for Chikudo <em>Ohasama</em> (who studied also at Heidelberg) a friend of mine
								(an "awakened" man) "worked" in Berlin with Ohasama.
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>PROOF</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								NOW! What "proof" could any of these Zen Masters give you? <em class="double">What would
									you accept as "proof"</em>?
							</p>
							<p>
								If Jesus called on you one day <em class="double">what would you require as "proof"</em>?
							</p>
							<p>
								If two spies met in the old Nazi Germany (the "Third Reich" of Hitler) &amp; each
								<em>told</em> the other they were working for the "allies" (US, England etc.) what
								<em>proof</em> could they give one another? All documents would mean <span class="nowrap">
									nothing ---</span> <em>HOW</em> could they get together?
							</p>
							<p>
								<!-- [Arrow in left margin pointing to the beginning of this paragraph; eliminated in this edition of the page] -->
								What proof could <em>anyone</em> give of something that was a personal experience?
							</p>
							<p>
								After Jesus was supposed to feed 5,000 with 5 loaves of bread &amp; 2 fishes, the
								religious leaders asked him for <em>a "sign"</em>. Wow! What did they want? More?
								Red, white &amp; blue rays from every pore like poor Gautama??
							</p>
							<!-- -->

							<!-- -->
							<p>
								It is <em>not</em> a matter of "ignorance" &amp; "authority."</p>
							<p>
								I am <em>imposing</em> nothing on you &amp; expect nothing of you.</p>
							<!-- [Arrow in left margin pointing to the following sentence:] -->
							<p>
								But you wrote me &amp; I have no earthly way of knowing what you desire as proof?
								<em>You never tell me.</em>
							</p>
							<!-- [Arrow in right margin pointing to the previous sentence, eliminated here.]-->
							<p>
								The "Supreme Court" has established <em>clear rules of evidence</em> &amp; in law
								what is admissible &amp; what is not admissible is clearly codified.
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>"SAID"</em>?
							</div>
							<p>
								But you wait to hear ANYTHING WHATEVER that is <em class="double">said</em> &amp;
								automatically (&amp; correctly) reply "nyet" (NO!). "Doubt" in you is <em>more</em>
								than scepticism. It is a "quest."
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>"DONE"</em>?
							</div>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
								Then if you see something <em class="double">done</em> what is that to you? Is that
								what you want? Miracles? Wonders? "Signs"?
							</p>
							<blockquote style="margin-top: 0;">
								<p>
									A little levitation?
									<br />
									One of my letters appearing under your plate without coming through the mails?<br />
									A vision?
									<br />
									WHAT?
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								<!--[Arrow in left margin pointing to this sentence:]-->
								<img src="images/right-arrow.png" />&nbsp; What would you regard as "proof"?
							</p>
							<p>
								Please include a stamped addressed envelope. A mere psychotherapist who talks to
								you for 5 years (or you to him) may cost <em>$6,500 or more</em> (say $25 a week).
								So .04 is still cheap &amp; I don't get it as <em>revenue</em>. Uncle Sam gets it.

-->
							<p>
								If it isn't worth <em>that</em> to you then the thing for you to do is <em>obvious.</em>
								But have <em>the decency</em> to write a pleasant last letter &amp; say good-bye
								like a human being.
