								Dear Richard,
							</p>
							<p>
								Mac <sup>[1]</sup> is very kind, and your letter is very straightforward. As Mac
								may have told you I am not a believer in polite phrases but feel that to save time
								we should tell the truth as best as we can.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. McIntyre. See Roses's prior letter.]
							</p>
							<p>
								You are 43, no longer young, and in a position that I found intolerable. Like you,
								I was a "seeker," but it is obvious no <em>words</em> will satisfy you. Otherwise
								let us publish them in the newspapers. From this the vanity of using mind (intellect)
								in the search is obvious.
							</p>
							<p>
								However as you say IT IS ALL WE HAVE, so at the same time as you recognize the vanity
								of the instrument <em>you have to use it</em> to consider what A.R.P. is all about
								(for example).
							</p>
							<p>
								It is all vague and tantalizing -- not even to know what your <em>are</em> &amp;
								what is to become of you.
							</p>
							<p>
								Consider this from A.R.P.'s standpoint (if you can!). He tries to "work" only with
								likely cases. Even then success is not 100%. He gets months (even years) of misunderstanding
								&amp; trouble from each one of these, and more gray hairs.
							</p>
							<p>
								They are not to "blame," they are using a mind which is amazingly persnickety &amp;
								easily slips into mere debating society argument (on every minutest point) so that
								the wood is lost in the trees ... <em>not knowing the result aimed at</em> they
								are not deeply dedicated (usually) and things go in one ear and out the other.
							</p>
							<p>
								He cannot tell them that as far as he knows he is their only hope -- and that an
								uncertain one -- unless they wish to go somewhere for <em>personal</em> "work" (say
								to a Zen instructor or to Subud).
							</p>
							<p>
								He knows something people call "God" &amp; which governs his life -- but not theirs.
								They can be flippant about it, he can not. One day they may say "This is obvious"
								but until then they cannot "believe" &amp; every inch of the way is a hard fight.
							</p>

							<p>
								He <em>has</em> to be "tough" with them to remove their obstacles but <em>they</em>
								&nbsp;interpret it as quarreling with them -- as though he would waste weary time
								in that form of amusement!
							</p>
							<p>
								This is written at 2:30 a.m. for example &amp; the weight of the 3,000,000,000 people
								in the world seems at such an hour very oppressive. Further he knows that <em>not one</em>
								of them can be trusted or treated as a real friend until after their "awakening."
								They are treacherous in fact <em>at some point</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								I wonder if Jesus had <em>one</em> friend?
							</p>
							<p>
								The world seems stranger to me perhaps than even to you. Perhaps I could find only
								1 out of several tens of thousands who would understand this.
							</p>
							<p>
								Why not tell me as much as you can of your early upbringing and religion &amp; those
								things you have since studied &amp; your opinion about them --- indeed 'open up'
								about your real sentiments.
