									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									I will try to give something of my personal history as your requested. Catholic Parentage. Mother very devout. Convinced me at quite an early age that I was called for the priesthood. At the age of twelve began studies for same. Left the seminary at the age of seventeen... disappointed that the gentlemen there could not fulfill my expectations of them. The Catholic doctrine and hierarchy began to look objectionable to me. I started looking about for other path to knowledge of higher things.
								</p>
								<p>
									Looked into Spiritualism, and began studying psychology. Then attended college until twenty three. The war came at this time, and I became interested in yoga. Lived in Baltimore at the time and did little but work, sleep, eat and read. Yoga seem to answer that which conventional religions failed to answer. At the age of twenty-five I drifted away from it, but stayed on the vegetarian diet. I went back at intervals of a couple months, would practice it for as long as a year. Went into it from its appeal to my intuition.
								</p>
								<p>
									I married at thirty three. At about that same time I decided that I was going to quit piddling around and attempt to really do something, instead of just reading about it. I decided to try to be as scientific as possible in sorting out the men who claimed to know. I intended to earnestly seek out other sincere people to learn what they knew and to expand my contacts until I met someone who seemed likely to be able to teach me a trick or two not yet in my ken.
								</p>
								<p>
									I figured that to do something (no matter how seemingly unrewarding) was better than to sit and wait for extinction. I decided that there could well be an application in mental pursuits to the "Law of Returns" that energy put in might be proportionate to results, or that if I threw enough mud at the ceiling, a percentage might stick. I travelled whenever I heard of a man who had unusual abilities. I bought books. I organized or worked to organize groups of people locally for "school" or experimentation work. I corresponded with as many as I could. I even advertized...and that is how I met Mac.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have examined most of the cults, some directly, and some by their literature. I find that Money is the commodity, and that they generally pretend to transmute it into some bit of wisdom. I have as little respect for organized religion, although I feel that there may well be a purpose for it... that it may be ultimately part of the scheme of things, or that it may be the work of "Kal" to contribute to the continued blindness of man.
								</p>
								<p>
									I quite agree with you it is hard to communicate with others about abstract convictions. If a man has been fleeced by a cult, he may react negatively to you if you use the same tactics or seem to use the same tactic at they do... even though the motives of the cult or pseudo-knower be realized by such dialectics while the other person is sincere. For instance I corresponded with a man who introduced me to a cult "Brotherhood" that put out papers of clever dialectics. They made statements which they defended with this system of dialectics, and reduced the aspirant to wordlessness by attacking whatever he said. Now if such a process were to "Clear" or "Open" then it is little wonder that some aspirants who had when been through army training, or "brotherhood" dialectics, might turn and charge your fortress with all the mental vanity of a Don Quixote.
								</p>
								<p>
									That I am yet clothed in vanity is quite possible. I must continue to use each faculty until I can learn to get along without it.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you say that you "know" God I conclude you to be either a great and well-nigh incomprehensible man or else a liar, since you do not appear deranged. If you are the great and incomprehensible man then I can really see that it will take some doing to find a medium of communication. If it is true that the finite mind cannot perceive (conceive) the infinite, then my relative bicameral approach is in for some effort.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let me ask you a question. Concerning the post-mortem chances for the more fortunate who manage to attain immortality...
								</p>
								<p>
									1. Are there any in your opinion who become immortal?
								</p>
								<p>
									2. Do you believe or know whether such immortality involves the death of the body or "translation" of same?
								</p>
								<p>
									When you ask for sentiments, you ask for things sentimental, which smacks of the emotional which according to Ouspensky is even lower than the pseudo-intellectual. If man (undeveloped man) has many facets or "doers" or egos, then we here run the risk of creating new ego-faces. Yes and now I hide behind Ouspensky.
								</p>
								<p>
									What do you prescribe?
