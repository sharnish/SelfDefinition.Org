								Dear Richard,
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>Brain-washing or brain-sucking?</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								I am not a "movement" &amp; I haven't "sucked the brain-blood of mankind." <em>Very
									few</em> people write to me and those that "succeed" (even those that do not)
								are not <em>LESS</em> &nbsp;intelligent, but more so, not less sceptical but more
								so. My line is not belief, it is proof. However there is a paradox (IF THERE WERE
								NOT THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BE "AWAKENED"!) -- the <em>first step</em> must be <em>belief
									that proof will come</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Like many others I wondered what satori was, what the Oriental religions were all
								about, what Gautama, Eckhart, Lao Tse, Jesus, <span class="nowrap">Heraclitus ---</span>
								<em>experienced</em>. I soon found that there was SOMETHING, &amp; to little Alfred
								that was a <em>sufficient</em> &nbsp; challenge. But one has first to dip one toe
								in the ocean.
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>Oops!</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								Many thanks for the photograph, I see what you mean. [R. had written: "Hope it is
								of help in your psychoanalysis."]
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>Sense or no-sense?</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								But speaking of "brain-blood" and so forth you negate your own early words (Aug
								17) "I have come to look upon reason as the vanity of the intellect."
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>HUBRIS</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								The truth is you are still the Supreme Court to yourself even though Heraclitus
								says:
							</p>
							<!-- Heraclitus Greek lettering -- requires unicode -->
							<!-- ὕβριν χρὴ σβεννύναι μᾶλλον ἢ πυρκαῖήν  -->
							<!-- source:  http://www.heraclitusfragments.com/B43/index.htmln -->
							<!-- Heraclitus fragment B43 -->
							<p>
								ὕβριν χρὴ σβεννύναι μᾶλλον ἢ πυρκαῖήν
							</p>
							<p>
								("One should extinguish <em>pride</em> more carefully than a great conflagration."
								-- and not leave a spark. ὕβρις
								<!-– see Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />Hubris --> or HUBRIS = pride, presumption.)
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								What do you hope to find -- and <em>where</em>? <em>Answer </em><span class="nowrap">
									<em>me</em> ...</span>
							</div>
							<p>
								YOU KNOW, and your letters show it, that there is absolutely no way to gain anything
								by a verbal understanding. If one could, then let us publish it right away in the
								magazines &amp; newspapers! By "anything" I mean "anything ultimate" as regards
								ourselves &amp; this universe, the source of it or what is responsible for it.
							</p>
							<p>
								<!-- do not reformat paragraph -->
								Thus there is <em>only one way</em> left -- it is <em>work on oneself</em> &amp;
								it is found, since you cannot decide <i><em><span style='font-style: italic'>not to
											decide</span></em></i>, <em>which is essential</em>, that a friend or teacher
								is necessary.
							</p>
							<p>
								If I were "only a searcher for truth" we could go on yak-yakking our fool heads
								off and the correspondence would <em>really</em> be piddling -- as piddling as philosophy
								or art-criticism.
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								As Lao Tse says: Flat, no obvious <em>goal</em> ...
							</div>
							<p>
								Whether I were working personally with you or by mail (as so few, if any, do) the
								kind of work would be the same, seemingly "flat, stale and unprofitable," distasteful,
								uninteresting, no new discoveries, not tit-bits, no theories, plodding, annoying,
								with no obvious aim or goal &amp; no obvious raison d'être [i.e., reason for being].</p>
							<!--  -->

							<!-- MISSING UNDERLINED WORDS (7 words) AT TOP OF THIS PAGE, #71 -->
							<!--  -->
							<!--  <div class="left-margin-note" style="left: -8rem; width: 8rem; top: 1rem;"></div>-->
							<p>
								WHY IS THIS? A <em>smart</em> fellow would see at once. I have a well-stocked library,
								I could (&amp; have do so) write <em>fascinating</em> stuff, like, say, Manly Palmer
								Hall in his "Horizon" magazine. There you can get the low-down, inside stuff on
								Nostradamus, the Tarot, The Hung Society, Diana of the Ephesians, The Kundalini,
								Dante, Blake, Mandala Magic, The Harmon Papers, The Nuremberg Chronicle, The Tribes
								in the Light Blue Mountains &amp; so forth. (3341 Griffith Park Blvd., Los Angeles
								27, Calif.)
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								Beware when the self is <em>pleased!</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								&nbsp;EGO <em>PURRS</em>. THIS IS THE LIFE! EGO <em>IS PLEASED</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								But that is the whole trouble. These glamorous things actually leave a worse taste
								behind. It is like knowing how the illusionists &amp; professional magicians do
								their tricks. It gets terribly blah!
							</p>
							<p>
								There is One Self, not many. You hold it away by your insistence (like most people)
								in holding to the hegemony [i.e., predominance] of your "self." When your hand finally
								releases its hold of the bedclothes your pretended "ownership" of your body (which
								you do not even "run") &amp; of your consciousness (as though it were a piece of
								real estate) <em>ceases</em>, but the Consciousness goes on.
							</p>
							<p>
								What will happen to you will happen to me.
							</p>
							<p>
								However you <em>can</em> know the One Self-Consciousness as well as you know anyone
								-- indeed far better. By "know" I mean really know, know by experience, know by
								acquaintance, know intimately -- not any of the theological hot-air &amp; clap-trap.
								I speak as a mathematician with accounting &amp; auditing background &amp; scientific
								education -- not as a dweller on cloud 51 or a "true believer."
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								Ego kicks <em>up</em>!
							</div>
							<p>
								But <em>you</em> are judging all the time "I AM IMPATIENT" (lucky <em>I</em> am
								not), "I FEEL IT IS A DOG CHASING ITS TAIL -- A STRANGE RITUAL."
							</p>
							<p>
								You said "A STRANGE AND <em>FRUITFUL</em> RITUAL" as a bare possibility. Well I
								have been <em>successful</em> with several friends &amp; they <em>did</em> "attain"
								&amp; they <em>did</em> say "How could you have put up with this nonsense?" (just
								<em>exactly</em> like yours) <em>&amp; I said "My teacher put up with me</em>."
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								You are like all the rest -- maybe more <em>inaccessible</em>.
							</div>
							<p>
								When <em>you</em> stop trying to run the show &amp; to discover some verbalized
								magic, <em>when the maturing change starts to show</em> in self-indulgent &amp;
								smart-aleck Richard, then I know we are on the way. As yet you have merely <em>fenced</em>
								&amp; shown no participation or understanding.
							</p>
							<p>
								Heraclitus said "Dogs bark at what they do not understand." So while I chase my
								tail you bark! (But I am <em>not</em> implying you are a dog or even a s.o.b.)
							</p>
							<p>
								I am NOT a psychoanalyst -- you are fully capable of tracing your own attitude to
								various childish manifestations -- if that <em>is</em> the cause. "I don't wanna,
								Mom. I don't wanna" &amp; he grows up another C.G. Jung. Boy, oh boy. But be comforted.
								Suzuki said of me "no hope &amp; not worth the effort." He was right, it was IMPOSSIBLE.
								But it happened because to the One nothing is "impossible." So of it happened to
								Alfred who was worse (if
								<!-- BOTTOM CUT OFF HERE IN THE PDF -->
								possible!!) than you, it could happen to you.
