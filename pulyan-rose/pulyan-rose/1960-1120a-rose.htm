									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									Again you mistake my attitude, either naively or pretentiously for the sake of argument.
									In the first line of your letter your indicate a desire for argument.
								</p>
								<p>
									I do not ask for proof. I admit I have said that reasoning is the vanity of the
									intellect... but the vanity goes on until something better happens.
								</p>
								<p>
									Names of sages or saints (name dropping) rings no bell for me, unless I want to
									employ reason and hire a detective to run down all that has been written to gather
									evidence as to whether they ever existed, and whether they actually knew or taught
									anything worthwhile.
								</p>
								<p>
									Greek words, Latin words, or French words, or other glamorous hieroglyphics do not
									convince me that Truth was conveyed in any of these languages alone, nor that I
									should rush to embrace something merely because strange quotations give us an escape
									into the exotic.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am only trying to feel. And it is lamentable that my feelings should be negatively
									inspired by your writings.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let me digress for an instance, that may explain what I am trying to say (which,
									if you do not understand, precludes to me that there is no use in further bickering).
								</p>
								<p>
									I just came back from Akron where I went over the weekend to meet with some people.
									One fellow was a Rosicrucian. To look at, he did not inspire. Short, rotund, jolly,
									and possessed of a sort of paternal conceit about things he had, or thought he had.
									I had learned in advance that he claimed to have an astral guru, but I did not know
									that he was a Rosicrucian.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have always had a lack of desire for the AMORC group in particular because they
									seemed absurd and commercialistic. Now he tells me that it was thru them alone that
									he had found proof of immortality, and proof of reincarnation. I am sitting face
									to face to him, and I think he is utterly sincere although a bit reticent about
									exposing things he has been pledged to retain as secret or confidential. I mentioned
									to him that I thought that he was sincere, but that I next had to ascertain if he
									know that he knew or if I could find that he was deluded. He was a scientist of
									sorts (engineer) and he gave me some good answers. I have been digging for over
									twenty years and I thought I had ably sifted at least the rackets from the good-intending.
									Whatever that is. Here comes a fellow along who is a member of a club that I consider
									the lowest one on the roster. The one least likely to do anybody any good. And he
									is sold on it, and I cannot give him a good argument, much less discern by hunch
									whether he is on the gold road or not.
								</p>
								<p>
									He claims to know of his previous incarnation... knows who he was. Claims to have
									the secrets of the Kabala, and the Masonic esoteric teachings, which he calls detours.
									I pressed for what amounted to proof of his assertions and he reminded me of your
									statements when he answered that all I had to do was to join the order and belong
									as long as he (25 years) and he felt sure that I would be as far along as he. He
									claimed that that which was Real to him was Actuality to him but not to me because
									my reality differed in proportion to my REALization and my ability for REALization
									depended upon a certain growth or essence, or chemical change in the inner man.
									Whatever that is. But whatever it is, if we preclude he is right we start getting
									an inferiority complex, which is fat for the fire of every or any lesson-peddler.
								</p>
								<p>
									I also met another man, a successful broker, who was sold on Theosophy. He became
									alarmed when I laughed at the statement that Master Morya existed. He was utterly
									convinced that these Masters were available in astral form. But the Rosicrucian
									said he was on a detour. Yet the Rosicrucian had an astral guru. What goes on here?
								</p>
								<p>
									Now let us take my underlined propensity for doubting. Should I doubt or accept
									both of them blindly?
								</p>
								<p>
									What is it that I should do that is obvious?
