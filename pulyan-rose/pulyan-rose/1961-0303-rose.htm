									Friend Al,
								</p>
								<p>
									(As regards my quibbling or evaluation:) You have forgotten that all you ask for
									is conversational fodder. I have been trying these months to find out what you want
									or want done and it boils down to --"Keep on writing and do not try to ask intelligent
									questions." What can ensue but drivel? - and when the drivel comes there is no point
									in criticizing.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am trying to follow the instructions. You said write, even if I recite "Mary had
									a little lamb." Do not take anything too seriously that I say... however I would
									feel more uninhibited if you would answer some of my questions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Naturally you agree that words and language are of some importance else we would
									not be using this medium of communication. And with these words we are constantly
									evaluating. Until we get in some peculiar rapport where words are superfluous.
								</p>
								<p>
									In my diggings I find some least common denominators in or among the isms and religious
									theory and implementation.
								</p>
								<p>
									I asked you a few you did not answer. Is the logos, or the word or God, an audible
									sound. I am not asking this out of levity.
								</p>
								<p>
									From your notes under kriya yoga, I presume that you mean that man at death loses
									self-identity, or self-consciousness or awareness. I still would like to know why
									you find it important to find this knowledge of oblivion. Yes I realize that there
									may be a subtle kind of consciousness that might possibly survive unconsciousness,
									but the it is immediately in the category of self-consciousness.
								</p>
								<p>
									The "low tone" of our correspondence has been set by you. You have in fact attacked
									me for being polite. I have quotes from your letters I could refer to... but you
									are aware of them. I cannot deduce then that you are as "innocent as doves".
								</p>
								<p>
									How do you know Lincoln discovered it?
								</p>
								<p>
									If the student seeks the guru, how will he know him when he finds him?
