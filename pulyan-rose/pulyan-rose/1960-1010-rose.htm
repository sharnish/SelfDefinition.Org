									Friend Pulyan,
								</p>
								<p>
									You are evasive. What do you want to define as friendship? I presume by your correspondence that you do not wish me to play the credulous fool,&ndash;and I doubt if I should even if you did.
								</p>
								<p>
									You invited reasonable discussion of the items in the letters. And immediately you accuse me of being intellectual,-because I do so.
								</p>
								<p>
									You have made a statement that there is no immortality. If there is no immortality... and if your teaching of me is merely to allow me to know that I shall terminate totally... I would not care to strain too hard to find it out. If the statement is qualified then I do not appreciate deliberate misdirection.
								</p>
								<p>
									In your last letter you spoke of reincarnation is such a manner as to lead me to believe that such a condition existed. "Researchers try to get thru to their loved ones via a medium, but rarely look around in society to find where their loved one has reincarnated!!" Now you tell me that you know nothing of reincarnation.
								</p>
								<p>
									A person who "know God directly" should know whether or not he has had past lives or future ones.
								</p>
								<p>
									In your letter of August 27 you stated that there was no Immortality. If so, what difference does it make if we come to know God or not?
								</p>
								<p>
									Another question I would emphasize is "What do you want to define as friendship?" Shall it be a mutual exchange? This is hardly possible because you have so much to give and I have nothing. Shall I on the other hand give you honesty, while you toy with evasiveness. I realize that abstract things are not verbalizable, but I also realize that you are trying to verbalize something to me else we would not be using words.
								</p>
								<p>
									You mistake the tone of my letters if you take me to have a jaunty attitude or cockiness. It is just that I presume that He who knows God knows everything, and I become suspicious when you manifest inconsistency. On the other hand, if this business of know God is a condition only, or a feeling, and is not coordinative with presumed synaptic knowledge or definite "understanding, then how can you be sure of what you experience as far as finality and validity is concerned.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am not gearing myself for argument. However I feel (in my definition of friendship) that it is not kosher to chatter about being able to duplicate the miracle of the loaves and fishes if you are not able to do it, and are talking to a person in desperation from hunger.
								</p>
								<p>
									How do you know that that which you experienced was God?
								</p>
								<p>
									Why did you choose the particular word "God" in lieu of Brahma or something else?
								</p>
								<p>
									What do you mean by awakening or enlightenment?
								</p>
								<p>
									A person is enlightened when he discovers that there is no Santa Claus, but to a person who discovers that beauty is in the mind and not in the object, then the former discovery does not seem like an enlightenment.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is true that much of what you say has been uttered before. And some that you say is in direct opposition to what the public reads about theology and fundamentalistic interpretation. I purposely avoid the reference to the Bible because everybody gets his backing from it one way or another. I have read Sikh and Moslem quotes from the Bible written to justify their own beliefs. Along comes another more esoteric metaphysician who will tell you that the only reason you do not endorse him by way of understanding the Bible is because you read the Bible literally... you should read it Kabbalistically, or Swedenborgianally, or you should read it while eating Peyote or standing on the head... to get the proper (his) slant.
								</p>
								<p>
									You differ in that you deny the existence of an immortal soul. (I presume here that this is not a coy evasion of exact definition, but to mean that nothing of men survives the physical death.) In this case we are animals, and while it might be an intense delight for an animal to see a God (whatever that is), it seems kinder to tell the animal fairy tales and let it go to sleep somewhat narcoticized.
								</p>
								<p>
									What is this all about then? Are we going to try to be reasonable or impulsive? True... I want to grow closer to reality, to shed the illusion. However, if I am an illusion, and life-after-death is any form is non-existent, then what does it matter to me if someone tells me that I, too, am an illusion? How can the transient know of the eternal?
								</p>
								<p>
									You speak as though sending a photograph will make us friends!
								</p>
								<p>
									It is true that to understand you I would have to have experienced what which you have plus. I also know that I can do little about by-passing that experience except by guessing or intuition.
								</p>
								<p>
									I realize that I can now neither decide nor negate. As you infer. Any similarity between either and the above efforts to effect understanding is illusory. Just trying to be cooperative.
