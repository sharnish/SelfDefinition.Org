							<p class="para-number">XXI</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, does the Tathâgata think in this wise: The
								Law has been taught by me?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat, does the Tathâgata
								think in this wise: The Law has been taught by me.' Bhagavat said: 'If a man should say
								that the Law has been taught by the Tathâgata, he would say what is not true; he would
								slander me with untruth which he has learned. And why? Because, O Subhûti, it is said
								the teaching of the Law, the teaching of the Law indeed. O Subhûti, there is nothing
								that can be perceived by the name of the teaching of the Law.'</p>
							<p>After this, the venerable Subhûti spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'Forsooth, O Bhagavat, will
								there be any beings in the future, in the last time, in the last moment, in the last 500
								years, during the time of the decay of the good Law, who, when they have heard these
								very Laws, will believe?' Bhagavat said: 'These, O Subhûti, are neither beings nor
								no-beings. And why? Because, O Subhûti, those who were preached as beings, beings
								indeed, they were preached as no-beings by the Tathâgata, and therefore they are called
								beings.'</p>
							<p class="para-number">XXII</p>
							<p>'What do you think then, O Subhûti, is there anything which has been known by the
								Tathâgata in the form of the highest perfect knowledge?' The venerable Subhûti said:
								'Not indeed, O Bhagavat, there is nothing, O Bhagavat, that has been known by the
								Tathâgata in the form of the highest perfect knowledge.' Bhagavat said: 'So it is,
								Subhûti, so it is. Even the smallest thing is not known or perceived there, therefore it
								is called the highest perfect knowledge.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXIII</p>
							<p>'Also, Subhûti, all is the same there, there is no difference there, and therefore it is
								called the highest perfect knowledge. Free from self, free from being, free from life,
								free from personality, that highest perfect knowledge is always the same, and thus known
								with all good things. And why? Because, what were preached as good things, good things
								indeed, O Subhûti, they were preached as no-things by the Tathâgata, and therefore they
								are called good things.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXIV</p>
							<p>'And if, O Subhûti, a woman or man, putting together as many heaps of the seven treasures
								as there are Sumerus, kings of mountains, in the sphere of a million millions of worlds,
								should give them as a gift to holy and fully enlightened Tathâgatas; and, if a son or a
								daughter of a good family, after taking from this treatise of the Law, this
								Pragñâpâramitâ, one Gâthâ of four lines only, should teach it to others, then, O
								Subhûti, compared with his stock of merit, the former stock of merit would not come to
								the one hundredth part,' &amp;c., till 'it will not bear an approach.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXV</p>
							<p>'What do you think then, O Subhûti, does a Tathâgatas think in this wise: Beings have
								been delivered by me? You should not think so, O Subhûti. And why? Because there is no
								being, O Subhûti, that has been delivered by the Tathâgata. And, if there were a being,
								O Subhûti, that has been delivered by the Tathâgatas, then the Tathâgata would believe
								in self, believe in a being, believe in a living being, and believe in a person. And
								what is called a belief in self, O Subhûti, that is preached as no-belief by the
								Tathâgata. And this is learned by children and ignorant persons; and they who were
								preached as children and ignorant persons, O Subhûti, were preached as no-persons by the
								Tathâgata, and therefore they are called children and ignorant persons.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXVI</p>
							<p>'What do you think then, O Subhûti, is the Tathâgata to be seen (known) by the possession
								of signs?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat. So far as I know the meaning of the
								preaching of the Bhagavat, the Tathâgata is not to be seen (known) by the possession of
								signs.' Bhagavat said: 'Good, good, Subhûti, so it is, Subhûti; so it is, as you say; a
								Tathâgata is not to be seen (known) by the possession of signs. And why? Because, O
								Subhûti, if the Tathâgata were to be seen (known) by the possession of signs, a
								wheel-turning king also would be a Tathâgata; therefore a Tathâgata is not to be seen
								(known) by the possession of signs.' The venerable Subhûti spoke thus to the Bhagavat:
								'As I understand the meaning of the preaching of the Bhagavat, a Tathâgata is not to be
								seen (known) by the possession of signs.' Then the Bhagavat at that moment preached
								these two Gâthâs:</p>
							<blockquote> They who saw me by form, and they who heard me by sound,<br /> They engaged in
								false endeavours, will not see me.</blockquote>
							<blockquote> A Buddha is to be seen (known) from the Law; for the Lords (Buddhas) have the
								Law-body;<br /> And the nature of the Law cannot be understood, nor can it be made to be
								understood. </blockquote>
							<p class="para-number">XXVII</p>
							<p>'What do you think then, O Subhûti, has the highest perfect knowledge been known by the
								Tathâgata through the possession of signs? You should not think so, O Subhûti. And why?
								Because, O Subhûti, the highest perfect knowledge would not be known by the Tathâgata
								through the possession of signs. Nor should anybody, O Subhûti, say to you that the
								destruction or annihilation of any thing is proclaimed by those who have entered on the
								path of the Bodhisattvas.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXVIII</p>
							<p>'And if, O Subhûti, a son or a daughter of a good family were to fill worlds equal to the
								number of grains of sand of the river Gangâ with the seven treasures, and give them as a
								gift to holy and fully enlightened Tathâgatas; and if a Bodhisattva acquired endurance
								in selfless and uncreated things, then the latter will on the strength of this produce a
								larger stock of merit, immeasurable and innumerable.</p>
							<p>'But, O Subhûti, a stock of merit should not be appropriated by a noble-minded
								Bodhisattva.' The venerable Subhûti said: 'Should a stock of merit, O Bhagavat, not be
								appropriated by a Bodhisattva?' Bhagavat said: 'It should be appropriated, O Subhûti; it
								should not be appropriated; and therefore it is said: It should be appropriated.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXIX</p>
							<p>'And again, O Subhûti, if anybody were to say that the Tathâgata goes, or comes, or
								stands, or sits, or lies down, he, O Subhûti, does not understand the meaning of my
								preaching. And why? Because the word Tathâgata means one who does not go to anywhere,
								and does not come from anywhere; and therefore he is called the Tathâgata (truly come),
								holy and fully enlightened.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXX</p>
							<p>'And again, O Subhûti, if a son or a daughter of a good family were to take as many
								worlds as there are grains of earth-dust in this sphere of a million millions of worlds,
								and reduce them to such fine dust as can be made with immeasurable strength, like what
								is called a mass of the smallest atoms, do you think, O Subhûti, would that be a mass of
								many atoms?' Subhûti said: 'Yes, Bhagavat, yes, Sugata, that would be a mass of many
								atoms. And why? Because, O Bhagavat, if it were a mass of many atoms, Bhagavat would not
								call it a mass of many atoms. And why? Because, what was preached as a mass of many
								atoms by the Tathâgata, that was preached as no-mass of atoms by the Tathâgata; and
								therefore it is called a mass of many atoms. And what was preached by the Tathâgata as
								the sphere of a million millions of worlds, that was preached by the Tathâgata as
								no-sphere of worlds; and therefore it is called the sphere of a million millions of
								worlds. And why? Because, O Bhagavat, if there were a sphere of worlds, there would
								exist a belief in matter; and what was preached as a belief in matter by the Tathâgata,
								that was preached as no-belief by the Tathâgata; and therefore it is called a belief in
								matter.' Bhagavat said: 'And a belief in matter itself, O Subhûti, is unmentionable and
								inexpressible; it is neither a thing nor no-thing, and this is known by children and
								ignorant persons.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXXI</p>
							<p>'And why? Because, O Subhûti, if a man were to say that belief in self, belief in a
								being, belief in life, belief in personality had been preached by the Tathâgata, would
								he be speaking truly?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, Bhagavat, not indeed, Sugata; he would
								not be speaking truly. And why? Because, O Bhagavat, what was preached by the Tathâgata
								as a belief in self, that was preached by the Tathâgata as no-belief; therefore it is
								called belief in self.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'Thus then, O Subhûti, are all things to be perceived, to be looked upon,
								and to be believed by one who has entered on the path of the Bodhisattvas. And in this
								wise are they to be perceived, to be looked upon, and to be believed, that a man should
								believe neither in the idea of a thing nor in the idea of a no-thing. And why? Because,
								by saying: The idea of a thing, the idea of a thing indeed, it has been preached by the
								Tathâgata as no-idea of a thing.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XXXII</p>
							<p>'And, O Subhûti, if a noble-minded Bodhisattva were to fill immeasurable and innumerable
								spheres of worlds with the seven treasures, and give them as a gift to holy and fully
								enlightened Tathâgatas; and if a son or a daughter of a good family, after taking from
								this treatise of the Law, this Pragñâpâramitâ, one Gâthâ of four lines only, should
								learn it, repeat it, understand it, and fully explain it to others, then the latter
								would on the strength of this produce a larger stock of merit, immeasurable and
								innumerable. And how should he explain it? As in the sky:</p>
							<blockquote> Stars, darkness, a lamp, a phantom, dew, a bubble.<br> A dream, a flash of
								lightning, and a cloud&mdash;thus we should look upon the world (all that was made).<br>
							</blockquote>
							<p>Thus he should explain; therefore it is said: He should explain.'</p>
							<p>Thus spoke the Bhagavat enraptured. The elder Subhûti, and the friars, nuns, the faithful
								laymen and women, and the Bodhisattvas also, and the whole world of gods, men, evil
								spirits and fairies, praised the preaching of the Bhagavat. </p>
