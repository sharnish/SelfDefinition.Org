							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, if there were as many Gangâ rivers as there
								are grains of sand in the large river Gangâ, would the grains of sand be many?' Subhûti
								said: 'Those Gangâ rivers would indeed be many, much more the grains of sand in those
								Gangâ rivers.' Bhagavat said: 'I tell you, O Subhûti, I announce to you, If a woman or
								man were to fill with the seven treasures as many worlds as there would be grains of
								sand in those Gangâ rivers and present them as a gift to the holy and fully enlightened
								Tathâgatas&mdash;What do you think, O Subhûti, would that woman or man on the strength
								of this produce a large stock of merit?' Subhûti said: 'Yes, O Bhagavat, yes, O Sugata,
								that woman or man would on the strength of this produce a large stock of merit,
								immeasurable and innumerable.' Bhagavat said: 'And if, O Subhûti, a woman or man having
								filled so many worlds with the seven treasures should give them as a gift to the holy
								and enlightened Tathâgatas, and if another son or daughter of a good family, after
								taking from this treatise of the Law one Gâthâ of four lines only, should fully teach
								others and explain it, he, indeed, would on the strength of this produce a larger stock
								of merit, immeasurable and innumerable.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XII</p>
							<p>'Then again, O Subhûti, that part of the world in which, after taking from this treatise
								of the Law one Gâthâ of four lines only, it should be preached or explained, would be
								like a Kaitya (holy shrine) for the whole world of gods, men, and spirits; what should
								we say then of those who learn the whole of this treatise of the Law to the end, who
								repeat it, understand it, and fully explain it to others? They, O Subhûti, will be
								endowed with the highest wonder. And in that place, O Subhûti, there dwells the teacher,
								or one after another holding the place of the wise preceptor.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XIII</p>
							<p>After these words, the venerable Subhûti spoke thus to Bhagavat: 'O Bhagavat, how is this
								treatise of the Law called, and how can I learn it?' After this, Bhagavat spoke thus to
								the venerable Subhûti: 'This treatise of the Law, O Subhûti, is called the
								Pragñâ-pâramitâ (Transcendent wisdom), and you should learn it by that name. And why?
								Because, O Subhûti, what was preached by the Tathâgata as the Pragñâ-pâramitâ, that was
								preached by the Tathâgata as no-Pâramitâ. Therefore it is called the Pragñâ-pâramitâ.
							</p>
							<p>'Then, what do you think, O Subhûti, is there anything (dharma) that was preached by the
								Tathâgata?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagvat, there is not anything that was
								preached by the Tathâgata.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said. 'What do you think then, O Subhûti, the dust of the earth which is
								found in this sphere of a million millions of worlds, is that much?' Subhûti said: 'Yes,
								O Bhagavat, yes, O Sugata, that dust of the earth would be much. And why? Because, O
								Bhagavat, what was preached by the Tathâgata as the dust of the earth, that was preached
								by the Tathâgata as no-dust. Therefore it is called the dust of the earth. And what was
								preached by the Tathâgata as the sphere of worlds, that was preached by the Tathâgata as
								no-sphere. Therefore it is called the sphere of worlds.' </p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, is a holy and fully enlightened Tathâgata
								to be seen (known) by the thirty-two signs of a hero?' Subhûti said: 'No indeed, O
								Bhagavat; a holy and fully enlightened Tathâgata is not to be seen (known) by the
								thirty-two signs of a hero. And why? Because what was preached by the Tathâgata as the
								thirty-two signs of a hero, that was preached by the Tathâgata as no-signs. Therefore
								they are called the thirty-two signs of a hero.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'If, O Subhûti, a woman or man should day by day sacrifice his life
								(selfhood) as many times as there are grains of sand in the river Gangâ, and if he
								should thus sacrifice his life for as many kalpas as there are grains of sand in the
								river Gangâ, and if another man, after taking from this treatise of the Law one Gâthâ of
								four lines only, should fully teach others and explain it, he indeed would on the
								strength of this produce a larger stock of merit, immeasurable and innumerable.'
							</p>
							<p class="para-number">XIV</p>
							<p>At that time, the venerable Subhûti was moved by the power of the Law, shed tears, and
								having wiped his tears, he thus spoke to Bhagavat: 'It is wonderful, O Bhagavat, it is
								exceedingly wonderful, O Sugata, how fully this teaching of the Law has been preached by
								the Tathâgata for the benefit of those beings who entered on the foremost path (the path
								that leads to Nirvâna), and who entered on the best path, from whence, O Bhagavat,
								knowledge has been produced in me. Never indeed, O Bhagavat, has such a teaching of the
								Law been heard by me before. Those Bodhisattvas, O Bhagavat, will be endowed with the
								highest wonder, who when this Sûtra is being preached hear it and will frame to
								themselves a true idea. And why? Because what is a true idea is not a true idea.
								Therefore the Tathâgata preaches: "A true idea, a true idea indeed!"</p>
							<p>'It is no wonder to me, O Bhagavat, that I accept and believe this treatise of the Law,
								which has been preached. And those beings also, O Bhagavat, who will exist in the
								future, in the last time, in the last moment, in the last 500 years, during the time of
								the decay of the good Law, who will learn this treatise of the Law, O Bhagavat, remember
								it, recite it, understand it, and fully explain it to others, they will indeed be
								endowed with the highest wonder.</p>
							<p>'But, O Bhagavat, there will not arise in them any idea of a self, any idea of a being,
								of a living being, or a person, nor does there exist for them any idea or no-idea. And
								why? Because, O Bhagavat, the idea of a self is no-idea, and the idea of a being, or a
								living being, or a person is no-idea. And why? Because the blessed Buddhas are freed
								from all ideas.'</p>
							<p>After these words, Bhagavat thus spoke to the venerable Subhûti: 'So it is, O Subhûti, so
								it is. Those beings, O Subhûti, who when this Sûtra was being recited here will not be
								disturbed or frightened or become alarmed, will be endowed with the highest wonder. And
								why? Because, O Subhûti, this was preached by the Tathâgata, as the Paramapâramitâ,
								which is no-Pâramitâ. And, O Subhûti, what the Tathâgata preaches as the Paramapâramitâ,
								that was preached also by immeasurable blessed Buddhas. Therefore it is called the
								Paramapâramitâ.</p>
							<p>'And, O Subhûti, the Pâramitâ or the highest perfection of endurance (kshânti) belonging
								to a Tathâgata, that also is no-Pâramitâ. And why? Because, O Subhûti, at the time when
								the king of Kalinga cut my flesh from every limb, I had no idea of a self, of a being,
								of a living being, or of a person; I had neither an idea nor no-idea. And why? Because,
								O Subhûti, if I at that time had had an idea of a self, I should also have had an idea
								of malevolence. If I had had an idea of a being, or of a living being, or of a person, I
								should also have had an idea of malevolence. And why? Because, O Subhûti, I remember the
								past 500 births, when I was the Rishi Kshântivâdin (preacher of endurance). At that time
								also, I had no idea of a self, of a being, of a living being, of a person. Therefore
								then, O Subhûti, a noble-minded Bodhisattva, after putting aside all ideas, should raise
								his mind to the highest perfect knowledge. He should frame his mind so as not to believe
								(depend) in form, sound, smell, taste, or anything that can be touched, in something
								(dharma), in nothing or anything. And why? Because what is believed is not believed (not
								to be depended on). Therefore the Tathâgata preaches: "A gift should not be given by a
								Bodhisattva who believes in anything, it should not be given by one who believes in
								form, sound, smell, taste, or anything that can be touched."</p>
							<p>'And again, O Subhûti, a Bodhisattva should in such wise give his gift for the benefit of
								all beings. And why? Because, O Subhûti, the idea of a being is no-idea. And those who
								are thus spoken of by the Tathâgata as all beings are indeed no-beings. And why?
								Because, O Subhûti, a Tathâgata says what is real, says what is true, says the things as
								they are; a Tathâgata does not speak untruth.</p>
							<p>'But again, O Subhûti, whatever doctrine has been perceived, taught, and meditated on by
								a Tathâgata, in it there is neither truth nor falsehood. And as a man who has entered
								the darkness would not see anything, thus a Bodhisattva is to be considered who is
								immersed in objects, and who being immersed in objects gives a gift. But as a man who
								has eyes would, when the night becomes light, and the sun has risen, see many things,
								thus a Bodhisattva is to be considered who is not immersed in objects, and who not being
								immersed in objects gives a gift.</p>
							<p>'And again, O Subhûti, if any sons or daughters of good families will learn this treatise
								of the Law, will remember, recite, and understand it, and fully explain it to others,
								they, O Subhûti, are known by the Tathâgata through his Buddha-knowledge, they are seen,
								O Subhûti, by the Tathâgata through his Buddha-eye. All these beings, O Subhûti, will
								produce and hold fast an immeasurable and innumerable stock of merit.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XV</p>
							<p>'And if, O Subhûti, a woman or man sacrificed in the morning as many lives as there are
								grains of sand in the river Gangâ and did the same at noon and the same in the evening,
								and if in this way they sacrificed their lives for a hundred thousands of niyutas of
								kotîs of ages, and if another, after hearing this treatise of the Law, should not oppose
								it, then the latter would on the strength of this produce a larger stock of merit,
								immeasurable and innumerable. What should we say then of him who after having written
								it, learns it, remembers it, understands it, and fully explains it to others?</p>
							<p>'And again, O Subhûti, this treatise of the Law is incomprehensible and incomparable. And
								this treatise of the Law has been preached by the Tathâgata for the benefit of those
								beings who entered on the foremost path (the path that leads to Nirvâna), and who
								entered on the best path. And those who will learn this treatise of the Law, who will
								remember it, recite it, understand it, and fully explain it to others, they are known, O
								Subhûti, by the Tathâgata through his Buddha-knowledge, they are seen, O Subhûti, by the
								Tathâgata through his Buddha-eye. All these beings, O Subhûti, will be endowed with an
								immeasurable stock of merit, they will be endowed with an incomprehensible,
								incomparable, immeasurable and unmeasured stock of merit. All these beings, O Subhûti,
								will equally remember the Bodhi (the highest Buddha-knowledge), will recite it, and
								understand it. And why? Because it is not possible, O Subhûti, that this treatise of the
								Law should be heard by beings of little faith, by those who believe in self, in beings,
								in living beings, and in persons. It is impossible that this treatise of the Law should
								be heard by beings who have not acquired the knowledge of Bodhisattvas, or that it
								should be learned, remembered, recited, and understood by them. The thing is impossible.
							</p>
							<p>'And again, O Subhûti, that part of the world in which this Sûtra will be propounded,
								will have to be honoured by the whole world of gods, men, and evil spirits, will have to
								be worshipped, and will become like a Kaitya (a holy sepulchre).' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XVI</p>
							<p> And, O Subhûti, sons or daughters of a good family who will learn these very Sûtras, who
								will remember them. recite them, understand them, thoroughly take them to heart, and
								fully explain them to others, they will be overcome, they will be greatly overcome. And
								why? Because, O Subhûti, whatever evil deeds these beings have done in a former birth,
								deeds that must lead to suffering, those deeds these beings, owing to their being
								overcome, after they have seen the Law, will destroy, and they will obtain the knowledge
								of Buddha.</p>
							<p>'I remember, O Subhûti, in the past, before innumerable and more than innumerable kalpas,
								there were eighty-four hundred thousands of niyutas of kotîs of Buddhas following after
								the venerable and fully enlightened Tathâgata Dîpankara, who were pleased by me, and
								after being pleased were not displeased. And if, O Subhûti, these blessed Buddhas were
								pleased by me, and after being pleased were not displeased, and if on the other hand
								people at the last time, at the last moment, in the last 500 years, during the time of
								the decay of the good Law, will learn these very Sûtras, remember them, recite them,
								understand them, and fully explain them to others, then, O Subhûti, in comparison with
								their stock of merit that former stock of merit will not come to one hundredth part,
								nay, not to one thousandth part, not to a hundred thousandth part, not to a ten
								millionth part, not to a hundred millionth part, not to a hundred thousand ten millionth
								part, not to a hundred thousands of niyutas ten millionth part. It will not bear number,
								nor fraction, nor counting, nor comparison, nor approach, nor analogy.</p>
							<p>'And if, O Subhûti, I were to tell you the stock of merit of those sons or daughters of
								good families, and how large a stock of merit those sons or daughters of good families
								will produce, and hold fast at that time, people would become distracted and their
								thoughts would become bewildered. And again, O Subhûti, as this treatise of the Law
								preached by the Tathâgata is incomprehensible and incomparable, its rewards also must be
								expected (to be) incomprehensible.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XVII</p>
							<p>At that time the venerable Subhûti thus spoke to the Bhagavat: 'How should a person,
								after having entered on the path of the Bodhisattvas, behave, how should he advance, and
								how should he restrain his thoughts?' Bhagavat said: 'He who has entered on the path of
								the Bodhisativas should thus frame his thought: All beings must be delivered by me in
								the perfect world of Nirvâna; and yet after I have thus delivered these beings, no being
								has been delivered. And why? Because, O Subhûti, if a Bodhisattva had any idea of
								beings, he could not be called a Bodhisattva, and so on from the idea of a living being
								to the idea of a person; if he had any such idea, he could not be called a Bodhisattva.
								And why? Because, O Subhûti, there is no such thing (dharma) as one who has entered on
								the path of the Bodhisattvas. </p>
							<p>'What do you think, O Subhûti, is there anything which the Tathâgata has adopted from the
								Tathâgata Dîpankara with regard to the highest perfect knowledge? 'After this, the
								venerable Subhûti spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'As far as I, O Bhagavat, understand the
								meaning of the preaching of the Bhagavat, there is nothing which has been adopted by the
								Tathâgata from the holy and fully enlightened Tathâgata Dîpankara with regard to the
								highest perfect knowledge.' After this, Bhagavat thus spoke to the venerable Subhûti:
								'So it is, Subhûti, so it is. There is not, O Subhûti, anything which has been adopted
								by the Tathâgata from the holy and fully enlightened Tathâgata Dîpankara with regard to
								the highest perfect knowledge. And if, O Subhûti, anything had been adopted by the
								Tathâgata, the Tathâgata Dîpankara would not have prophesied of me, saying: "Thou, O
								boy, wilt be in the future the holy and fully enlightened Tathâgata called Sâkyamuni."
								Because then, O Subhûti, there is nothing that has been adopted by the holy and fully
								enlightened Tathâgata with regard to the highest perfect knowledge, therefore I was
								prophesied by the Tathâgata Dîpankara, saying: "Thou, boy, wilt be in the future the
								holy and fully enlightened Tathâgata called Sâkyamuni."</p>
							<p>'And why, O Subhûti, the name of Tathâgata? It expresses true suchness. And why
								Tathâgata, O Subhûti? It expresses that he had no origin. And why Tathâgata, O Subhûti?
								It expresses the destruction of all qualities. And why Tathâgata, O Subhûti? It
								expresses one who had no origin whatever. And why this? Because, O Subhûti, no-origin is
								the highest goal.</p>
							<p>'And whosoever, O Subhûti, should say that, by the holy and fully enlightened Tathâgata,
								the highest perfect knowledge has been known, he would speak an untruth, and would
								slander me, O Subhûti, with some untruth that he has learned. And why? Because there is
								no such thing, O Subhûti, as has been known by the Tathâgata with regard to the highest
								perfect knowledge. And in that, O Subhûti, which has been known and taught by the
								Tathâgata, there is neither truth nor falsehood. Therefore the Tathâgata preaches: "All
								things are Buddha-things." And why? Because what was preached by the Tathâgata, O
								Subhûti, as all things, that was preached as no-things; and therefore all things are
								called Buddha-things.</p>
							<p>'Now, O Subhûti, a man might have a body and a large body.' The venerable Subhûti said:
								That man who was spoken of by the Tathâgata as a man with a body, with a large body, he,
								O Bhagavat, was spoken of by the Tathâgata as without a body, and therefore he is called
								a man with a body and with a large body.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'So it is, O Subhûti; and if a Bodhisattva were to say: "I shall deliver
								all beings," he ought not to be called a Bodhisattva. And why? Is there anything, O
								Subhûti, that is called a Bodhisattva?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, Bhagavat, there is
								nothing which is called a Bodhisattva.' Bhagavat said: 'Those who were spoken of as
								beings, beings indeed, O Subhûti, they were spoken of as no-beings by the Tathâgata, and
								therefore they are called beings. Therefore the Tathâgata says: "All beings are without
								self all beings are without life, without manhood, without a personality."</p>
							<p>'If, O Subhûti, a Bodhisattva were to say: "I shall create numbers of worlds," he would
								say what is untrue. And why? Because, what were spoken of as numbers of worlds, numbers
								of worlds indeed, O Subhûti, these were spoken of as no-numbers by the Tathâgata, and
								therefore they are called numbers of worlds.</p>
							<p>'A Bodhisattva, O Subhûti, who believes that all things are without self, he has faith,
								he is called a noble-minded Bodhisattva by the holy and
								fully enlightened Tathâgata.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XVIII</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, has the Tathâgata the bodily eye?' Subhûti
								said: 'So it is, O Bhagavat, the Tathâgata has the bodily eye.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, has the Tathâgata the heavenly eye?'
								Subhûti said: 'So it is, O Bhagavat, the Tathâgata has the heavenly eye.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, has the Tathâgata the eye of knowledge?'
								Subhûti said: 'So it is, O Bhagavat, the Tathâgata has the eye of knowledge.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, has the Tathâgata the eye of the Law?'
								Subhûti said: 'So it is, O Bhagavat, the Tathâgata has the eye of the Law.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, has the Tathâgata the eye of Buddha?'
								Subhûti said: 'So it is, O Bhagavat, the Tathâgata has the eye of Buddha.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, as many grains of sand as there are in the
								great river Gangâ&mdash;were they preached by the Tathâgata as grains of sand?' Subhûti
								said: 'So it is, O Bhagavat, so it is, O Sugata, they were preached as grains of sand by
								the Tathâgata.' Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, if there were as many
								Gangâ rivers as there are grains of sand in the great river Gangâ; and, if there were as
								many worlds as there are grains of sand in these, would these worlds be many?' Subhûti
								said: 'So it is, O Bhagavat, so it is, O Sugata, these worlds would be many.' Bhagavat
								said: 'As many beings as there are in all those worlds, I know the manifold trains of
								thought of them all. And why? Because what was preached as the train of thoughts, the
								train of thoughts indeed, O Subhûti, that was preached by the Tathâgata as no-train of
								thoughts, and therefore it is called the train of thoughts. And why? Because, O Subhûti,
								a past thought is not perceived, a future thought is not perceived, and the present
								thought is not perceived.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">XIX</p>
							<p>'What do you think, O Subhûti, if a son or a daughter of a good family should fill this
								sphere of a million millions of worlds with the seven treasures, and give it as a gift
								to holy and fully enlightened Buddhas, would that son or daughter of a good family
								produce on the strength of this a large stock of merit?' Subhûti said: 'Yes, a large
								one.' Bhagavat said: 'So it is, Subhûti, so it is; that son or daughter of a good family
								would produce on the strength of this a large stock of merit, immeasurable and
								innumerable. And why? Because what was preached as a stock of merit, a stock of merit
								indeed, O Subhûti, that was preached as no-stock of merit by the Tathâgata, and
								therefore it is called a stock of merit. If, O Subhûti, there existed a stock of merit,
								the Tathâgata would not have preached: "A stock of merit, a stock of merit indeed!"'
							</p>
							<p class="para-number">XX</p>
							<p>'What do you think then, O Subhûti, is a Tathâgata to be seen (known) by the shape of his
								visible body?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat, a Tathâgata is not to be seen
								(known) by the shape of his visible body. And why? Because, what was preached, O
								Bhagavat, as the shape of the visible body, the shape of the visible body indeed, that
								was preached by the Tathâgata as no-shape of the visible body, and therefore it is
								called the shape of the visible body.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, should a Tathâgata be seen (known) by the
								possession of signs?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat, a Tathâgata is not to be
