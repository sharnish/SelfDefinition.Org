							<p class="center"><em>ADORATION to the blessed Ârya-pragñâ-pâramitâ (perfection of
									wisdom)</em></p>
							<p class="para-number">I</p>
							<p>Thus it was heard by me: At one time Bhagavat (the blessed Buddha) dwelt in Srâvastî, in
								the grove of Geta, in the garden of Anâthapindada, together with a large company of
								Bhikshus (mendicants), viz. with 1250 Bhikshus, with many noble-minded Bodhisattvas.</p>
							<p>Then Bhagavat having in the forenoon put on his undergarment, and having taken his bowl
								and cloak, entered the great city of Srâvastî to collect alms. Then Bhagavat, after he
								had gone to the great city of Srâvastî to collect alms, performed the act of eating, and
								having returned from his round in the afternoon, he put away his bowl and cloak, washed
								his feet, and sat down on the seat intended for him, crossing his legs, holding his body
								upright, and turning his reflection upon himself. Then many Bhikshus approached to where
								Bhagavat was, saluted his feet with their heads, turned three times round hira (?) to
								the
								right, and sat down on one side.</p>
							<p class="para-number">II</p>
							<p>At that time again the venerable Subhûti came to that assembly and sat down. Then rising
								from his seat and putting his robe over one shoulder, kneeling on the earth with his
								right knee, he stretched out his folded hands towards Bhagavat and said to him: 'It is
								wonderful, O Bhagavat, it is exceedingly wonderful, O Sugata, how much the noble-minded
								Bodhisattvas have been favoured with the highest favour by the Tathâgata, the holy and
								fully enlightened! It is wonderful how much the noble-minded Bodhisattvas have been
								instructed with the highest instruction by the Tathâgata, the holy and fully
								enlightened! </p>
							<p>How then, O Bhagavat, should the son or the daughter of a good family,
								after having entered on the path of the Bodhisattvas, behave, how should he advance, and
								how should he restrain his thoughts?'</p>
							<p>After the venerable Subhûti had thus spoken, Bhagavat said to him: 'Well said, well said,
								Subhûti! So it is, Subhûti, so it is, as you say. The noble-minded Bodhisattvas have
								been favoured with the highest favour by the Tathâgata, the noble-minded Bodhisattvas
								have been instructed with the highest instruction by the Tathâgata. Therefore, O
								Subhûti, listen and take it to heart, well and rightly. I shall tell you, how any one
								who has entered on the path of Bodhisanvas should behave, how he should advance, and how
								he should restrain his thoughts.' Then the venerable Subhûti answered the Bhagavat and
								said: 'So be it, O Bhagavat.'</p>
							<p class="para-number">III</p>
							<p>Then the Bhagavat thus spoke to him: 'Any one, O Subhûti, who has entered here on the
								path of the Bodhisattvas must thus frame his thought: As many beings as there are in
								this world of beings, comprehended under the term of beings (either born of eggs, or
								from the womb, or from moisture, or miraculously), with form or without form, with name
								or without name, or neither with nor without name, as far as any known world of beings
								is known, all these must be delivered by me in the perfect world of Nirvâna. And yet,
								after I have thus delivered immeasurable beings, not one single being has been
								delivered. And why? If, O Subhûti, a Bodhisattva had any idea of (belief in) a being, he
								could not be called a Bodhisattva (one who is fit to become a Buddha). And why? Because,
								O Subhûti, no one is to be called a Bodhisattva, for whom there should exist the idea of
								a being, the idea of a living being, or the idea of a person.'</p>
							<p class="para-number">IV</p>
							<p>'And again, O Subhûti, a gift should not be given by a Bodhisattva, while he believes in
								objects; a gift should not be given by him, while he believes in anything; a gift should
								not be given by him, while he believes in form; a gift should not be given by him, while
								he believes in the special qualities of sound, smell, taste, and touch. For thus, O
								Subhûti, should a gift be given by a noble-minded Bodhisattva, that he should not
								believe even in the idea of cause. And why? Because that Bodhisattva, O Subhûti, who
								gives a gift, without believing in anything, the measure of his stock of merit is not
								easy to learn.'&mdash;'What do you think, O Subhûti, is it easy to learn the measure of
								space
								in the eastern quarter?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat.'&mdash;Bhagavat said:
								'In
								like manner, is it easy to learn the measure of space in the southern, western, northern
								quarters, below and above (nadir and zenith), in quarters and subquarters, in the ten
								quarters all round?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed,</p>
							<p>O Bhagavat.' Bhagavat said: 'In the same manner, O Subhûti, the measure of the stock of
								merit of a Bodhisattva, who gives a gift without believing in anything, is not easy to
								learn. And thus indeed, O Subhûti, should one who has entered on the path of
								Bodhisattvas give a gift, that he should not believe even in the idea of cause.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">V</p>
							<p>'Now, what do you think, O Subhûti, should a Tathâgata be seen (known) by the possession
								of signs?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat, a Tathâgata is not to be seen (known)
								by the possession of signs. And why? Because what has been preached by the Tathâgata as
								the possession of signs, that is indeed the possession of no-signs.'</p>
							<p>After this, Bhagavat spoke thus to the venerable Subhûti: 'Wherever there is, O Subhûti,
								the possession of signs, there is falsehood; wherever there is no possession of signs,
								there is no falsehood. Hence the Tathâgata is to be seen (known) from no-signs as
								signs.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">VI</p>
							<p>After this, the venerable Subhûti spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'Forsooth, O Bhagavat, will
								there be any beings in the future, in the last time, in the last moment, in the last 500
								years, during the time of the decay of the good Law, who, when these very words of the
								Sûtras are being preached, will frame a true idea?' The Bhagavat said: 'Do not speak
								thus, Subhûti. Yes, there will be some beings in the future, in the last time, in the
								last moment, in the last 500 years, during the decay of the good Law, who will frame a
								true idea when these very words are being preached.</p>
							<p>'And again, O Subhûti, there will be noble-minded Bodhisattvas, in the future, in the
								last time, in the last moment, in the last 500 years, during the decay of the good Law,
								there will be strong and good and wise beings, who, when these very words of the Sûtras
								are being preached, will frame a true idea. But those noble-minded Bodhisattvas, O
								Subhûti, will not have served one Buddha only, and the stock of their merit will not
								have been accumulated under one Buddha only; on the contrary, O Subhûti, those
								noble-minded Bodhisattvas will have served many hundred thousands of Buddhas, and the
								stock of their merit will have been accumulated under many hundred thousands of Buddhas;
								and they, when these very words of the Sûtras are being preached, will obtain one and
								the same faith. They are known, O Subhûti, by the Tathâgata through his
								Buddha-knowledge; they are seen, O Subhûti, by the Tathâgata through his Buddha-eye;
								they are understood, O Subhûti, by the Tathâgata. All these, O Subhûti, will produce and
								will hold fast an immeasurable and innumerable stock of merit. And why? Because, O
								Subhûti, there does not exist in those noble-minded Bodhisattvas the idea of self, there
								does not exist the idea of a being, the idea of a living being, the idea of a person.
								Nor does there exist, O Subhûti, for these noble-minded Bodhisattvas the idea of quality
								(dharma), nor of no-quality. Neither does there exist, O Subhûti, any idea (samgñâ) or
								no-idea. And why? Because, O Subhûti, if there existed for these noble-minded
								Bodhisattvas the idea of quality, then they would believe in a self, they would believe
								in a being, they would believe in a living being, they would believe in a person. And if
								there existed for them the idea of no-quality, even then they would believe in a self,
								they would believe in a being, they would believe in a living being, they would believe
								in a person. And why? Because, O Subhûti, neither quality nor no-quality is to be
								accepted by a noble-minded Bodhisattva. Therefore this hidden saying has been preached
								by the Tathâgata: "By those who know the teaching of the Law, as like unto a raft, all
								qualities indeed must be abandoned; much more no-qualities"' </p>
							<p class="para-number">VII</p>
							<p>And again Bhagavat spoke thus to the venerable Subhûti: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, is
								there anything (dharma) that was known by the Tathâgata under the name of the highest
								perfect knowledge, or anything that was taught by the Tathâgata?'</p>
							<p>After these words, the venerable Subhûti spoke thus to Bhagavat: 'As I, O Bhagavat,
								understand the meaning of the preaching of the Bhagavat, there is nothing that was known
								by the Tathâgata under the name of the highest perfect knowledge, nor is there anything
								that is taught by the Tathâgata. And why? Because that thing which was known or taught
								by the Tathâgata is incomprehensible and inexpressible. It is neither a thing nor
								no-thing. And why? Because the holy persons are of imperfect power.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">VIII</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, if a son or daughter of a good family
								filled this sphere of a million millions of worlds with the seven gems or treasures, and
								gave it as a gift to the holy and enlightened Tathâgatas, would that son or daughter of
								a good family on the strength of this produce a large stock of merit?' Subhûti said:
								'Yes, O Bhagavat, yes, O Sugata, that son or daughter of a good family would on the
								strength of this produce a large stock of merit. And why? Because, O Bhagavat, what was
								preached by the Tathâgata as the stock of merit, that was preached by the Tathâgata as
								no-stock of merit. Therefore the Tathâgata preaches: "A stock of merit, a stock of merit
								indeed!"' Bhagavat said: 'And if, O Subhûti, the son or daughter of a good family should
								fill this sphere of a million millions of worlds with the seven treasures and should
								give it as a gift to the holy and enlightened Tathâgatas, and if another after taking
								from this treatise of the Law one Gâthâ of four lines only should fully teach others and
								explain it, he indeed would on the strength of this produce a larger stock of merit
								immeasurable and innumerable. And why? Because, O Subhûti, the highest perfect knowledge
								of the holy and enlightened Tathâgatas is produced from it; the blessed Buddhas are
								produced from it. And why? Because, O Subhûti, when the Tathâgata preached:</p>
							<p class="blockquote">"The qualities of Buddha, the qualities of Buddha indeed!"</p>
							<p> they were preached by him as
								no-qualities of Buddha. Therefore they are called the qualities of Buddha.' </p>
							<p class="para-number">IX</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'Now, what do you think, O Subhûti, does a Srota-âpanna <span class="note">[one who has entered the stream, 1st grade of sanctification]</span>
								think in this
								wise: The fruit of Srota-âpatti has been obtained by me?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O
								Bhagavat, a Srota-âpanna does not think in this wise: The fruit of Srota-âpatti has been
								obtained by me. And why? Because, O Bhagavat, he has not obtained any particular state
								(dharma). Therefore he is called a Srota-âpanna. He has not obtained any form, nor
								sounds, nor smells, nor tastes, nor things that can be touched. Therefore he is called a
								Srota-âpanna. If, O Bhagavat, a Srota-âpanna were to think in this wise: The fruit of
								Srota-âpatti has been obtained by me, he would believe in a self, he would believe in a
								being, he would believe in a living being, he would believe in a person.' </p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, does a Sakridâgâmin <span class="note">[one
									who returns once, 2nd grade]</span> think in this wise: The
								fruit of a Sakridâgâmin has been obtained by me?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat,
								a Sakridâgâmin does not think in this wise: The fruit of a Sakridâgâmin has been
								obtained by me. And why? Because he is not an individual being (dharma), who has
								obtained the state of a Sakridâgâmin. Therefore he is called a Sakridâgâmin.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, does an Anâgâmin <span class="note">[one
									who does not return at all, 3rd grade]</span> think in this wise: The
								fruit of an Anâgâmin has been obtained by me?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat, an
								Anâgâmin does not think in this wise: The fruit of an Anâgâmin has been obtained by me.
								And why? Because he is not an individual being, who has obtained the state of an
								Anâgâmin. Therefore he is called an Anâgâmin.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, does an Arhat think in this wise: The fruit
								of an Arhat has been obtained by me?' Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat, an Arhat
								does not think in this wise: The fruit of an Arhat has been obtained by me. And why?
								Because he is not an individual being, who is called an Arhat. Therefore he is called an
								Arhat. And if, O Bhagavat, an Arhat were to think in this wise: The state of an Arhat
								has been obtained by me, he would believe in a self, he would believe in a being, he
								would believe in a living being, he would believe in a person.</p>
							<p>'And why? I have been pointed out, O Bhagavat, by the holy and fully enlightened
								Tathâgata, as the foremost of those who dwell in virtue.</p>
							<p>I, O Bhagavat, am an Arhat, freed from passion. And yet, O Bhagavat, I do not think in
								this wise: I am an Arhat, I am freed from passion. If, O Bhagavat, I should think in
								this wise, that the state of an Arhat has been obtained by me, then the Tathâgata would
								not have truly prophesied of me, saying: "Subhûti, the son of a good family, the
								foremost of those dwelling in virtue, does not dwell anywhere, and therefore he is
								called a dweller in virtue, a dweller in virtue indeed!"' </p>
							<p class="para-number">X</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O Subhûti, is there anything (dharma) which the
								Tathâgata has adopted from the Tathâgata Dîpankara <span class="note">[a former
									buddha]</span>, the holy and fully enlightened?'
								Subhûti said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat; there is not anything which the Tathâgata has
								adopted from the Tathâgata Dîpankara, the holy and fully enlightened.'</p>
							<p>Bhagavat said: 'If, O Subhûti, a Bodhisattva should say: "I shall create numbers of
								worlds," he would say what is untrue. And why? Because, O Subhûti, when the Tathâgata
								preached: Numbers of worlds, numbers of worlds indeed! they were preached by him as
								no-numbers. Therefore they are called numbers of worlds.</p>
							<p>'Therefore, O Subhûti, a noble-minded Bodhisattva should in this wise frame an
								independent mind, which is to be framed as a mind not believing in anything, not
								believing in form, not believing in sound, smell, taste, and anything that can be
								touched. Now, for instance, O Subhûti, a man might have a body and a large body, so that
								his size should be as large as the king of mountains, Sumeru. Do you think then, O
								Subhûti, that his selfhood (he himself) would be large?' Subhûti said: 'Yes, O Bhagavat,
								yes, O Sugata, his selfhood would be large. And why? Because, O Bhagavat, when the
								Tathâgata preached: "Selfhood, selfhood indeed!" it was preached by him as no-selfhood.
								Therefore it is called selfhood.' </p>
