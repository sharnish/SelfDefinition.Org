New on the website. If you don't know much about Buddhism you can see from the table of contents that it's probably not what you thought.

A good place to start because it goes right to the heart of the matter: A science of consciousness aimed at understanding the true self.

==========================================
Wikipedia has a good article on it:

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra draws upon the concepts and doctrines of Yogācāra and Buddha-nature. The most important doctrine issuing from the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra is that of the primacy of consciousness (Skt. ālayavijñāna) and the teaching of consciousness as the only reality. In the sūtra, the Buddha asserts that all the objects of the world, and the names and forms of experience, are manifestations of the mind:

"On the contrary my teaching is based upon the recognition that the objective world, like a vision, is a manifestation of the mind itself; it teaches the cessation of ignorance, desire, deed and causality; it teaches the cessation of suffering that arises from the discrimination of the triple world."
