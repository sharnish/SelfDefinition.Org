                                Interlocutor: The other day we were told that the initial practice is like looking in the mirror of consciousness. I try to put it into practice, but I do not quite understand it. Please, could you tell me where I made the mistake?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Parameshwar: The mistake is that you stayed in love with a concept. There is no such mirror of consciousness. The BE is already there, but not in a conscious way, it is in the background, forgotten, forgotten. Your mind is where the senses take you. You live continuously outside, externalized, without the need to pay attention to yourself. When you turn inward and cling to the feeling of being, that feeling is like the mirror where you look at yourself. We are not going to go deeper into the subject, but in those moments the most real thing you know is that feeling that you are alive, and that sensation is accompanied by your senses, that is, you feel the body, comfort or discomfort, hear sounds and see lights , even if you have your eyes closed, and so on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The interesting thing about all this is that among all the sensations that you receive there is one that matters to us, your own perception of existence, and I am not referring to how you perceive or live the existence, but to which you feel alive, to which you You know as an existing entity. This is a perception that must be isolated and enhanced, because it is the thread of the skein and you have to pull it. Can you tell that you exist?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: I exist because I have a body, I think and I feel ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Well, it is a starting point, you have already located everything that surrounds the feeling of being, now we have to isolate it and separate it from other perceptions as soon as you close your eyes to live &quot;inside&quot;. Who is the &quot;person&quot; in you who pays attention?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: Me!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Does that person (you) know that he is alive and perceives the sensation of the body, hears and sees?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: Yes! Am I alive because I perceive everything around me?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Sure! If you were not alive you would not notice anything, would you? [laughter]

                            <p>
                                Q: It has been the question of a million!

                            <p>

                            <p>
                                P: laugh, laugh! And ... are not you the one who perceives? Are you not the witness of everything that surrounds you? You are the consciousness that observes and realizes! Without body and senses ... how do you know it is you?
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            <p>
                                [Do not know what to say. There is a long pause. Parameshwar has her with a blank mind; He has left her, literally, searching for herself, searching for herself. After a while he addresses the others in a guile tone.]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: You all laughed, can you help her to find herself? Give her the answer she needs! Well, you have it, yes?

                            <p>

                                P: You can not imagine the power of Illusion. Your identity that you believe to be is illusion, it is a mass of attributes that you can not isolate separately. You all know intellectually that reality is Consciousness but, at the moment of truth, you do not know how or where to find it in yourselves. This has happened now is a great lesson for everyone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                [Parameshwar addresses the person in question.]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Do you know that you are consciousness?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: Yes, but as you say, I only know it mentally, I have the information, but when I look inside I can not find it. I do not know where to look, even if you tell me that I am the observer of everything that surrounds me. Is it not the mind that looks?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: What else does it give you if it is the mind or the consciousness that looks? Whatever it is called, it testifies, and that is you and you must learn to isolate yourself from the sensations of which you are a witness. With what I tell you, you already have material to practice and understand. Go directly to the witness you are, do not waste your time testifying the body, thoughts, etc. The witness in you is you, the only thing in you is capable of looking, and that is consciousness. It is not something you should look for, if you look for it as something foreign you are deceived. You are me. The information you have in your mind makes you doubt something that is simple, very simple. There are no I's, only ONE surrounded by intellectual doubts about what should or should not be. If you abandon these doubts, you remain alone with yourself. You are the focus of attention, the perceiver ... turn your gaze towards yourself, perceive yourself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let these words take effect and you will discover that throughout your life you have always been there, unalterable, despite the many personal changes that have occurred in you, living and observing everything, say, from &quot;inside&quot;.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do you have questions to ask? No? Then enter into meditation this missing hour and try to apply what you have understood. We will solve the problems little by little!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Good afternoon everyone! What topic do you want to deal with today?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: I have a question that goes round and round and I do not find a decent exit. The Maker no longer exists for the one who no longer has desires, whatever happens to him is the same. However, destiny is shaped in large part by our thoughts, desires and actions. So, is not this being the unconscious Maker of destiny? The puppet, without knowing it, configures a large part of his destiny. Not everything, but much is configured with the choice or decisions made ...; although it is true that there is only the true choice when one is conscious, and in pure consciousness there is no choice to make, only Being ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: You yourself have answered at the end of your question. Fate goes according to the degree of unconsciousness with which the action is committed. The unconsciousness produces suffering, both for oneself and for others, and because of this a corrective Law will be put into operation, it will be responsible for making understood by its effects, as an individuality that you are, what is right and wrong. Things work like this in this &quot;supposed illusion&quot; that we live.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Krishna teaches Arjuna that he must do his duty, he does it from another point of view that does not belong to the maker, this is precisely the one who cries and laments the death of relatives, the non-maker shoots the arrow directly at the heart of their cousins &#8203;&#8203;and, however, a teacher who abuses their students will have to ask them on their deathbed to please let them pay their karma.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Destiny is drawn according to the darkness that clouds the Heart. If one believes that he is &quot;the maker of his life&quot; and attains fame and wealth ... how do you think he will see himself if life (which can never be controlled) gives him a slap and loses everything? If he is intelligent, he will realize that he is absolutely the maker of nothing and that things go well in life when the wind blows in favor. When things go wrong, the concept of &quot;doer&quot; does not exist because he realizes that he does not control his life, no matter how hard he tries to make things go well for him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In any case, the concept of the maker falls on its own when the self realizes that it is consciousness and is not a mere way of being. As the ME gains consciousness it transcends personal qualities as well as developing, by understanding, an attitude in life and an ethic, because how will it hate its neighbor if it sees that the fellow is also ME, whether he knows it or not? Do what a self-conscious man does, others, those who are not, will see him as a doer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In any case, do not waste much time with these concepts, because the maker is quickly transcended, as well as the image one has of oneself, as soon as you begin to realize that you are the consciousness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
