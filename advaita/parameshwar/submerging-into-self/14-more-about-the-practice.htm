                                X: Parameshwar, I can not find the feeling of existence within me, no matter how hard I try, it is as if I had forbidden it. [X laughs with some tension.] I talk to my colleagues about it and no matter how much they explain to me, there's no way I can locate it. Thoughts arise without stopping creating a state of anxiety to see that others can and I can not.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: X, the fact that you can not find this point does not mean that it is not there or that you have it forbidden. You do not find it, first because you do not let go psychologically; second, because you want to find it at all costs and with this I tell you that you use the will and third, you have not understood that the Existing is the one who is looking for existence. You are the existent, there is no other than you in yourself. To have awareness of existence is to be the Existent himself, stop analyzing what I tell you. Who understands what I am telling you?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                X: The mind! The mind is what it understands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Are you sure about that? You have answered using a topic. For you, the mind is the intellect. Understanding is not thinking or developing a topic. Understanding is before intellectual action, and for understanding to appear before there must be a consciousness, an awareness. It is that &quot;realization&quot; that takes note of Existence here and now. The one who realizes his existence is you. The one who realizes things is consciousness, nothing else has that function in oneself. The intellect is only a consequence of awareness. Look at your hand and without saying a thought, realize who is watching it!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                [X looks at his hand and as time goes by he is embarrassed.]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Do not worry X, think about what I have said and understand it, observe in yourself this process that I have explained to you! It's just a matter of attention, the quality of care is determined by vasanas. You can see in yourself how the strength of Maya acts in a different way in all of us and how being so simple and obvious is a wall that prevents seeing it clearly. What happens to you is very normal, X. Before we all leave, I will give you a simple exercise to develop attention. Maintaining attention to the overall sensation of the body will help you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                [Parameshwar now addresses everyone]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Return constantly to you, every moment. Do not spend too much time absent. When you go down the street, put up warning points, signs, traffic lights, store signs. At each point of alert that you choose, make it your purpose to return to yourself and return to the perception of existence. If you act in this way, soon you will have around you a display of &quot;alarm clocks&quot; that will continually take you out of oblivion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A very important point, where your work is irremediably spoiled, is precisely when communicating with others. There you must redouble your efforts because the action of the dream is powerful when inoculating one another's fears, fantasies, worries, desires, etc. It is an authentic contamination from which one can get sick psychologically. It is not unknown to you to end a conversation with someone you know and end a negative mood. It happens to you many times, right? As it is commonly said, we have &quot;bought the bike&quot; from the other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                [laughter]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For talking! You have infected me with laughter, I have &quot;bought you the bike&quot;!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                [more laughs ...]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We spend our lives contaminating ourselves, and we do not even realize it, because that is precisely what we call &quot;living&quot;. It is as I said, a very important point of forgetfulness, and therefore we must be able to establish sufficient vigilance to avoid getting lost and pay the consequence: &quot;continually live sugested.&quot; Establishing oneself in the Center will create enough rupture of illusion capable of seeing the action of Maya in our environment, in others and how it truly regulates our life. Seeing Maya in others is easy, seeing it in us is more difficult, but it is also seen. She always acts when the Center is lost, and once recovered we can see in deferred how many puppets we have been during the time of &quot;forgetting&quot;.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Everything I tell you is real. The vasanas are being continually reinforced and recreated, and no matter how much they are said to be unreal, under the power of illusion they are the strongest chains that exist. Seeing the unreality of vasanas is only allowed to those who have realized their being, for the rest it is an unreal reality. We can all understand that the chains are an illusion, but we can only understand it while we have not realized the Self, because no matter how much we understand intellectually that we are already free, we will continue acting like the puppets we are, liking some things and not others; We will remain unaware of the effect of the actions, their consequences. Let's touch the ground The philosophy is very good and it is very beautiful. The words of the Masters are clear to you that you like Advaita, but you discard what other traditions or philosophies say. What excuse do you give to yourselves to justify disinterest in other ways? We spend our lives justifying ourselves. There we will also have to put a &quot;warning point&quot;. We have too much in mind, the world revolves around us, here another &quot;warning point&quot; is necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As you can see, it's not all about sitting in meditation and being happy. The Being, while it is not known, is a utopia, because the unconscious being of itself is a puppet, the ego.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Real, the non-illusory, is only when the consciousness realizes, meanwhile it is only a reflection in the conceptual mind. This is the Being in you. You do not know what makes you breathe, just breathe. Puppets that do not know that there are threads that move you, playing at being connoisseurs because you have the ability to understand the words of those who are no longer dolls. You should be aware of the meaning of these words because when you understand them and see them in their rawness, the inner strength that you need would appear immediately.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The strength of Maya is indestructible to a mind that only understands or intuits. Maya will always leave you satisfied in your level of understanding. Until you see the Illusion in you, you will not have the strength to sink into yourself and solve the equation, you will always leave the moment for another time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: Everything you explain here creates a lot of confusion for me. Maya is illusion, I do not understand that power that you attribute to her. Is not that power illusory? Do we really have to put these warning points in our lives to be what we are? All this is too complicated. I do not know ... No teacher talks about all that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: It's always the same song. You take the words of the teachers according to your own understanding, but the reality is that you are not at the same level. You do not know what efforts you have had to make in your sadhanas. The same Ramana divides the vasanas into two general types, those that prevent and those that do not impede Realization. Do you think that Ramana did not confront the vasanas that impede Realization? Do you think that Ramana did not know &quot;forgetfulness&quot;? Why did he teach that we should always be &quot;here&quot;? [Parameshwar points the center of the Heart with his finger.] Not everyone has the strength to constantly remain in the Self as Ramana had it. Everything I am telling you and that is so difficult for you to understand is encompassed in Ignorance, vasanas, ego. It is also difficult for you to understand because you really have not faced in practice what prevents you from being the Being that you are. For you, everything is philosophy, intellectual understanding. Try to practice the exercise of Life that is given here only one day and then come back and ask me the same question ... if you can. Not everyone is capable of sinking into himself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The time of practice is approaching. Five minutes and we started.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Remember: remain calm, do not be expectant. Focus your attention on the perception that you are alive, realize that you exist. Everything comes alone, do not expect anything.
