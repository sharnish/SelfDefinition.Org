                                P: I can not help but hear many times when you make comments among yourselves. Phrases like &quot;We are all One&quot; or &quot;The drop returns to the ocean&quot; are unreal, obeying a completely dual point of view. Said from the ego seems to contain a great truth, however they are still beautiful topics that betray the incomprehension of non-duality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That is ONE, is indivisible, and if we stick to it (for this we must understand what these two words mean), we conclude that there is no &quot;all&quot; or &quot;drops&quot; but the One and Indivisible it penetrates all the forms created in Him, and this is the correct understanding of Unity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You also talk a lot about the Internal Master, as if each one had a Master standing with open arms to pour out His Grace on you. This topic is also born of a dualistic misconception, but let's see the reason for this question.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lucid Life is the nucleus of all forms since they are penetrated and contained in It. It is not divided into portions in each of the forms, although apparently it gives the impression that it does, since from the point of view of ego ignorance it seems so, because it perceives differences between them. So, from the perspective of the real, there is only one ME, one Being and one Absolute and the ignorance that divides everything in the realm of illusion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Shivoham Mantra, &quot;I Am Shiva,&quot; points directly to one who lives or understands with obviousness all that I am telling you. If I am Indivisible, how can I see myself separated from everyone? Are there really others? No, I am in everything! Therefore I am the ignorant &quot;I&quot; and I am also the only Teacher who points the Way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Absolute accompanies in the Creation all the levels, is with the Being, is with the Real ME and is with the ego; Without it, perception is not possible, neither Knowledge nor ignorance. Nothing is possible without Him. Only in the ego there are differences and, if in the state of &quot;I am&quot; they persist, they disappear when he is extinguished. The Absolute is a Center that is constantly dissolving ignorance, it is enough to grab the rope of Existence and climb through it so that this attraction, commonly called Grace, dissolves the obstacles that apparently exist. In no-time there is no such thing as haste, and the Power of Life will create as many body-mind as is necessary for ignorance to be uprooted. To this mechanism the Tradition calls Reincarnation. Another topic blindly accepted based on duality and that is destroyed with a correct understanding of the Absolute.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: Ramana Maharshi did not believe in reincarnation, and yet he did not hesitate to use that concept when answering questions. Why this contradiction?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Ramana's understanding was just, but not that of the devotee. Individuality is non-existent and appears long after the body has been created. The basic idea of &#8203;&#8203;reincarnation is that the Being or the I transmigrates from body to body accumulating experiences until the moment of awakening and breaking the thread of reincarnations. But it is the Absolute, the ONE, that inhabits the body giving it life in Maya (the illusion) and later, Shakti, subject to the laws that the same life, develops harmoniously as an effect in His Light the different stages until falling into the I forget.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ramana could have explained that, but would the devotee's mind be prepared for such a denial?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: But there are cases in which reincarnation is demonstrated as a real fact. Cases of children remind me of their last life with hairs and signs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Yes, of course! The Absolute is in all the body-mind and, let's say it to understand us, is the one that lives all experiences, whether past, present or future, all cases occur in childhood, when the Principle of Identity has not yet appeared , causing the forgetting of the Real. It is a Law in Maya. There may be sporadic cases; I myself, before two years of age, had a glimpse of a previous life in France and the Rococo era.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: I understand, but it is too dense for me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Yes! That's why you should abandon intellectual curiosity and turn to yourself, which is not complicated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                [laughter]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: The Inner Master is ONE and Indivisible, it is the Being, the first reflection of the Absolute in Maya eclipsed by the veil of ignorance. The Self, which remains in the background and overlooked by the ego, is continually drawing the small portion of Pure Consciousness to Itself as if it were a magnet. As the ignorance is cleared, either by experience or by understanding, the Consciousness that being without form and without limits seems to be increasing, in the sense that the Consciousness participates more of Itself, that produces an effect on the Intelligence that is realizing, more and more consciousness, of a reality unnoticed by the ego-ego, to the point where it knows Itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This process occurs to a greater or lesser degree in all forms. Shiva helps Himself to awaken in all levels of ignorance in Maya. The Inner Master IS yourselves and you can say with all reason of the world: &quot;I am Shiva in this body-form.&quot; Hold on to this idea and understand everything from there, maybe things will fit better.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: Parameshwar, I have a question. Maybe it's as you say, intellectual curiosity, but ... when does all this end? When do we know we have finished our search?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: For you, the Way ends when your mind stops searching, but that only means &quot;I've arrived so far&quot;, even when there are issues to solve, such as deep-awake sleep, or breaking the three states of mind . It all depends on your &quot;smell&quot; to keep looking. Many end when they realize that they are ME Consciousness, others when they realize their non-existence as Individuality, but they are not absorbed in Turya, where they experience the Lucid Existence, the Being. Many times everything depends on the Tradition that you have adopted or the teacher you have followed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: Is it a matter of Karma?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: Maybe!
                            </p>
                            <p>
