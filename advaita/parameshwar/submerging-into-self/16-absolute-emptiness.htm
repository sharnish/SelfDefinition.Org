                            <p>
                                P: Remember! The true Silence is the Void, the absence of all perception, perceiver and perceived object. Within the perceiver I include every sense of being and recognition of oneself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The way we best describe this Void is Silence, Peace and Stillness; however, it has nothing to do with the conceptual emptiness, which annihilates everything, equating it with a kind of deep sleep. It is a clear emptiness, alive and pure, without a blemish since there are no mechanisms of perception, cognitive mind, senses, objects, and so on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Void or the Ultimate Absolute State can be experienced here and now by going beyond the three states of mind and even Turia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: You say that it can be experienced, but if there is no experimenter, how can there be experience? Is not it incongruent?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: You speak like that because you do not know the internal mechanism, the question is speculative, intellectual. You can only experience the extinction of your sense of existence when absorption occurs, leaving that Void that, incidentally, is the background, the substrate of everything in yourself. THAT you can not extinguish it because until there you do not reach. That state of Pure Lucidity, not impregnated by anything, is already here, in fact it has never moved nor will it move anywhere. In its purity is where any phenomenon is possible, as it can be an absorption experience, in this case, once everything is unfold, it is the mind-identity that takes note through remembrance, one of its functions, what has happened, and all thanks to the same Absolute State that sustains in itself every process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, it is necessary to give the language a wide margin to be able to communicate. Do not you think? Especially when there are no words to define what is beyond them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Returning to the theme of Silence ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two degrees of depth that you can enjoy through practice. One is the emptiness of the Absolute state that has already been spoken of above right now; the other is the cause of a lot of confusion, it can even lead the individual to think that everything is already done.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The absence of thought is this false emptiness, false because it is similar to the state of Turía, false because it still remains the witness of the process liking the moment, of the peace that surrounds it. I will never tire of warning about this. The minds of these individuals use a thousand and one tricks to adapt the writings or the words of the teachers to give conformity to their experience and thus terminate the inquiry. This state is only the preamble, the doormat at the door of the house and, of course, it is not beyond the three states of mind nor is the deep-awake dream of Liberation. In this state, the nature of Consciousness (&quot;I Am&quot;) is emptiness, but as long as there is still a possibility of understanding it will not be deepened or go beyond the present state.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I always tell you, I am telling you all this not for now, but for when the moment comes and discriminates against you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's time to practice.
