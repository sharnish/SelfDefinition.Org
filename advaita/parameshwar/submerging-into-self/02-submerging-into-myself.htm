                                Parameshwar: You all have read a lot about Advaita. You already know that teachers tell you what to do and where to look. Many forms of meditation are known, in addition to Self-inquiry; However, the simplest and most direct form is extracted from the same experience of the awareness of the SELF, which is in turn the continuous practice that makes those who know themselves to avoid falling into oblivion. It is the exercise of Life, a simplified but not less effective form than the traditional Vichara, which with its continued practice leads to the direct encounter with the knowledge that &quot;I Am&quot; Consciousness or Being is Existence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You already &quot;are&quot;, whether you know it or not, you just do not know what to do with that perception of being; However, the most unequivocal certainty that you have is your existence, you know - and do not doubt for a moment - that you are alive, that you exist. Well, it is about continuously maintaining the perception of &quot;I exist&quot; and isolating it from all the other messages that consciousness receives. Such perception must be sustained with the internal gaze and never lost sight of. You must jump over any doubt that appears in the mind and not break the perception or awareness of one's existence. Staying in such a state is called &quot;Self-consciousness&quot;, this must be maintained both in a state of meditation and during daily life, occupying the foreground among all the impressions that are received; Whether these are external or internal, the perception of &quot;I exist, I am&quot; should not be swept away by them. It is soon understood that the one who witnesses the continuous change of impressions is the &quot;existent&quot; without form capable of understanding, Consciousness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That is what you are: the Witness of everything that happens around you, the Observer of one's own existence and the one who knows that IS. There is no kind of depth in it, it's simple, who realizes things? I! That is the answer. But that I, the one that exists, must be disconnected from the body, because it remains alone without it. It is only through the action of ignorance about our own nature that we identify ourselves with the body, including it within our sense of Individuality. A little practice will break this false notion of entity; just as the mind, which is a fluctuation of almost uninterrupted thoughts, will remain silent, giving way to a state of Silence, Stillness and Peace. This is how all the great masters of all traditions have acted and found Silence in themselves. No, you do not have to visualize anything, you just have to grasp the sense of existence that is always there accompanying us, you do not even have to understand something so simple, so much that it seems like a big joke that philosophies and traditions have been raised around you. There is nothing sacred in that act, everything is too natural to grant a drop of devotion, but it is human nature itself that creates the illusion and confusion of different methodologies and paths. The only terrible thing is that we forget this simplicity, and about this forgetfulness we build our lives, constantly searching for the well-being we have lost outside of ourselves.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is nothing to look for and there is nothing to find, you know you are and do not doubt when you are told about your existence, the only thing you have to do is to maintain the feeling of being. You will know first hand why you have lost it and you will take very seriously that thing that we like to talk about and philosophize about: Maya.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, follow the thread of this certainty of existence and you will definitely be walking the path of Being. All teaching points to this, when you meet again you can leave it, just as a blind man leaves his cane when he regains his sight. This certainty will free you from all suffering and will give you the Peace that you have read so much about.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;I am, and I <em>know</em> that I am&quot;, until then you must arrive and then abandon it and enter the deep-awake sleep, a state that also passed into oblivion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All the doubts that appear on the practice, as well as experiences, etc., will be exposed here and the necessary answers will be given so that you can walk directly towards your Being-Existence, which the tradition calls Atman.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You will incorporate this exercise into every activity: Pay attention to the breath, at the point where it hits the chest, in the center. Do not concentrate attention, just realize that you are alive and the coming and going of the breath, trying not to alter its natural flow. The breath will show you its secret.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do you have any questions?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No? Well let's start the practice. Sit in meditation and begin to apply the exercise. This exercise should also be done in the work of everyday life, not only when you sit down to meditate. If you have doubts, do not stop asking. All the problems that arise will be solved as they appear.
                            </p>
