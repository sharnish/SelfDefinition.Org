                                Born in India, he came with his wife and children to Barcelona in the nineties where he set up a traditional business to make his living. About his identity there is a tacit silence on the part of all of us who were habitual assistants or disciples, since it was always his will to remain anonymous. And so it will be.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The title of Shri Satguru Parameshwar Maharaj was granted to him by his own teacher, of whom he had a portrait on a small altar in his living room where the &quot;classes&quot; were given on the days that he invited us. He also had hanging portraits of other masters of the Vedanta Tradition, among which the framed photograph of Ramana Maharshi, for whom he felt genuine devotion and admiration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Parameshwar is a rare case of mystic and at the same time the exception to the rule since his oldest memory goes back beyond his mother's womb. He used to say that he always had a very easy sadhana, and based on the Grace of the Shakti, to which he attributed his memories, he not only understood the Vedanta Advaita Tradition from a very young age, but also found points of disagreement, by which he was not disturbed, since he himself avoided falling into philosophical erudition. At the age of seventeen, he suddenly became aware of his reality &ndash; regarding Consciousness as his true identity &ndash; and it was from that moment that he saw the illusion and unreality, not only of his ego-personality, of his devotional and mystical life, but also saw the illusion that involved any type of teaching erected on top of the simplest and most obvious principle that occurs in existence: &quot;I Am.&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He soon began to sink into Himself and experience the extinction of his identity and sense of existence, a fact that caused him a great crisis for years. For the Tradition asserts that the Self is the Consciousness of Being or &quot;I Am&quot; and is indestructible. Being still a young man, his devotional crisis ended when he disappeared completely during a sitting in meditation, he lost all knowledge of himself, of his existence, of his body&mdash;and everything, absolutely everything, was contained in the state of Lucidity. His ecstasy lasted for a long time and, when the magic was broken, the perception of Being-Existence, his knowledge of &quot;I&quot;, returned all the content of Lucidity into its usual place, and the recognition of impressions was restored.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &quot;I Am&quot; realized what had happened and &quot;I Am&quot; knew that in THAT, the Absolute, not even by fantasy could it be called the Self, Atman or &quot;I Am.&quot; <span class="note">[?]</span> The puzzle was solved while his eyes shed tears of thanks to Shakti. From there the same Shakti attracted people with their hearts in a knot to be instructed in the Being. The same Shakti awoke in Parameshwar, completing his sadhana, consolidating him in the Realization of the Self, but as he himself said: &quot;With Atman the road is not finished; it really begins there.&quot; Shakti Kundalini took him to the last stages of Consciousness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Parameshwar never asked us for money for his teachings and he did not even accept the wish. &quot;If I have been given everything, I must give it in the same way,&quot; he would say whenever someone hinted at a price. He also used to say: &quot;The best way to pay me is to sink in yourself.&quot; He also did not ask us to serve him in any way or to give him anything. The only thing he asked us to do was to keep quiet around his figure as a teacher, since he was the one who chose his students and on rare occasions someone attended his classes without being vetted by us. He allowed us to make written notes and recordings, but never to take pictures. In reality we never got to understand well the reason for his desire of anonymity despite the fact that he told us that his task was not teaching but full realization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When he left with his wife to India there was a great emptiness in our hearts, even while able to verify in Parameshwar a great level of detachment, leaving behind part of his life and his work. His son and his wife spent some time in Barcelona finishing the business, leaving for London where they had a family, once all procedures had been completed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We do not know where Parameshwar lives or in what part of India the plane landed.
