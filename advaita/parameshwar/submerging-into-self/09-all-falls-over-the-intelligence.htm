                                P: The intellectual capacity, the understanding, the intuition, etc., are attributes of the Consciousness &quot;I Am&quot; that is the same Intelligence, what in oneself is the capacity to realize and understand, and is about this same Principle of Individuality on which falls the task of making the leap towards the Absolute, since in Turya the possibility of Understanding is no longer given, and that is because this Principle has been completely extinguished with all its attributes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, it is Consciousness itself that, being present in itself, is eliminated by understanding. What to do? The State of Silence and stillness where Lucidity shines by itself is witnessed by Self-consciousness, and that is precisely what has to be eliminated. Forgetting oneself in that state of purity is the key to passing to Turya. Unfortunately, this can not be done if the I Consciousness has not reached a continuity, I mean, permanence. That permanence is called by Tradition as the Realization of the Self, because it is precisely in this continuum that the Silence and the Peace of the Absolute begin to be consolidated. Without this requirement, the Witness is prey to the sleep mechanism, because this happens when the SELF is extinguished from a natural formality. When we fall asleep, all perception of I is lost sight of without possibility of recovery. When the &quot;I&quot; is consolidated, the experience of Lucidity is consolidated, it is permanent, and from there it is from where the jump to Turya or Turyatita is to be made. In the Silence of the Consciousness of I overfills the SELF, therefore it must be extinguished.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It can be produced in a natural way, since the Center produces extinction in a natural way, but Intelligence can also accelerate the event by producing a collapse of impressions in consciousness. In that state of pure awareness of Me, he must share self-attention with all the impressions that hit him, that is, be conscious of Himself and, at the same time and with the same intensity, of all kinds of information that arrives. through your senses, but ... in an instant. This procedure causes a &quot;short circuit&quot; that leaves the Lucidity alone with the perception of SE IS, this is the Self, Turya, where the Principle of Individuality has disappeared and any possibility of understanding has disappeared with it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Turya is the Lucidity with the sense of Existence, but there is no first person testifying the state; nevertheless, the Lucidity captures the moment, the experience that later the Intelligence will be able to remember using the faculty of the memory. The YO recovers the cliché and thanks to that knows its extinction in a superior state and its unreality. The gift is a new Understanding, which will be extended with renewed intuitions, for example, will understand what to do with that IS IS being able to use Intelligence to jump to the state of Turyatita, which is Lucidity without Existence or SE IS. He will know how to extinguish the BEING, the Atman, which is the same Thirst for Existence.

                                Q: What is the Thirst for Existence?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: What apparently breaks the Peace of the Absolute by forcing LIFE, Shakti, to recreate the Illusion and thereby create in Maya a new body.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: So, is the Being the cause of the illusion? Do you mean that the Self ...?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: The Being is the same Maya. Where does the Intelligence have reason to be? The Absolute is the seed of everything. The Absolute is not intelligent, but Intelligence is possible thanks to Him and its functionality only happens in the Illusion of Being. If there is nothing to understand, what is the point of Intelligence? What will you apply it to? If there is no I, where is the Intelligence held? Simply, Intelligence has no real existence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Thirst for Existence must be exhausted so that the effect of the Illusion does not occur, and with it I am saying that we have to jump over the Being. As much as the Tradition and the teachers subject to it say that the Being is the Absolute! It is Tradition itself that has created the fable of Reincarnation, a subject that if you want to address another time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I wish you understood that Life is not the same as Existence. The latter is the reflection of the Lucidity in the Illusion. If you understand this difference, you will understand what that Thirst is. The Absolute has no attributes but it is the Original Cause of the Illusion contained in itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But all this must not give any importance, it is only Knowledge and, in the end, all this is not worth anything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Questioner: Do you mean that Understanding is the only difference between Lucidity and Intelligence?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That is, the pure &quot;I Am&quot; sees and understands or knows in a single act, and this is Intelligence, then does lucidity see nothing? Or is it that pure Intelligence, however instantaneous that Saber, uses the discriminating mind, and the Lucidity, even seeing the same, does not process anything and therefore does not know anything?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: You have not caught on well, but it does not matter, since all this is such a complex issue that it is not even worth tackling; creates intellectual movement, concepts and with it, more confusion. The Absolute does not have qualities and, let's say it in a simple way, does not need them in its Purity. Intelligence is a quality and understanding, the effect of intelligence, and the discriminative or intellectual mind simply manages the data that understanding brings thanks to the awareness, the realization, of intelligence. For all this process to be, a medium is needed: MAYA. Get used to seeing things from &quot;the other side&quot;. ABSOLUTE LIFE or LIVING CONSCIOUSNESS has no attributes, but it is the first cause, the seed of all that is possible, the Illusion, that is, an effect is produced: Creation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q: Parameshwar, what you say about the Thirst for Existence, if I may, suggests to me the same as they say in another non-Vedanta tradition, but at one point ... I believe that the Truth is one, the image is used to be used ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In that tradition the Absolute or Life is called the &quot;Plane of Negative Existence&quot; or &quot;the Nothingness Full&quot; or &quot;the Empty Fullness&quot; because there is nothing, but it is full of Life or contains in seed all that there can be then.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To get out of this &quot;continuum of silence or nothingness&quot; there is a &quot;First Whirlwind&quot; that is not yet But that breaks that continuum. Then he suggests that this &quot;Thirst for Existence&quot; is equal to the &quot;First Swirl&quot;.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That is, the Being, which is contained in seed, emerges from that &quot;first swirl&quot; and there begins the manifestation or seed of Maya.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That is, the Being arises in the One as an affirmation, but it is only contained as a seed in the Absolute.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Gospel of St. John also says that &quot;at the beginning it was the Word&quot;, and the beginning already indicates temporality or beginning, that is, what you explain to us about the &quot;Thirst for Existence&quot; reminds me of something said in those other traditions with other words, right?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                P: I do not know that Tradition you are talking about, but yes, that First Swirl is the image of the Absolute in Maya. When the thirst for Existence creates in the Absolute the reflections of the forms in Him, it appears, as a reflection of it, the BEING.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On this which is written in the Gospel, which I had not read until someone pointed it out to me some time ago, it can be said that it is a clear and very similar way to the principles of Vedanta. I was very interested in this writing and it caught my attention because all the principles of Vedanta are contained in these verses.

                                Now, change God for Parabrahman, Word for Atman, life for existence, light for consciousness and darkness for illusion, ignorance, and you will have a truth which even Shankara could not intuit, although it did not go unnoticed by Dattatreya.

                            <p>
                                I-a: Did Shankara not notice this?

                            <p>
                                P: No! According to certain lines of erudition the subtlety of the difference between Paramatman and Atman was not perceived. Shankara was one of the greatest scholars and devotees who have existed in India, but that subtlety was perceived by Dattatreya and it is because he was an ascetic who sank into himself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shankara finishes everything in the Atman which equates with the Ultimate and Absolute, while Dattatreya puts the Atman in its proper place.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But these are only concepts that confront scholars and schools. The only thing that everyone agrees on is that it is necessary to sink into oneself, and enough work is had even to reach Consciousness &quot;I Am.&quot;
                            </p>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being is God in Maya and its appearance creates forms, and &quot;being with God&quot; implies two, duality. According to this Christian text, with the Being the duality begins, which is completely true, and Dattatreya confirms it. Being is the first attribute of the Absolute in Maya, a realm where any type of attribute is given.
                            </p>
                            <p>
