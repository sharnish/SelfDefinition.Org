                                I bow before Govinda,&nbsp;<sup>[1]</sup> the objectless object of final success in the highest wisdom, who is supreme bliss and the true teacher.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnote">
                                [1. The all-pervading omnipresent ruler of the sense organs.]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For beings a human birth is hard to win, then manhood and holiness, then excellence in the path of wise law; hardest of all to win is wisdom. Discernment between Self and not-Self, true judgment, nearness to the Self of the Eternal and Freedom are not gained without a myriad of right acts in a hundred births. This triad that is won by the bright one's favor is hard to gain: humanity, aspiration, and rest in the great spirit. After gaining at last a human birth, hard to win, then manhood and knowledge of the teaching, if one strives not after Freedom he is a fool. He, suicidal, destroys himself by grasping after the unreal. Who is more self-deluded than he who is careless of his own welfare after gaining a hard-won human birth and manhood, too? Let them declare the laws, let them offer to the gods, let them perform all rites, let them love the gods; without knowing the oneness with the Self, Freedom is not won even in a hundred years of the Evolver. "There is no hope of immortality through riches," says the scripture. It is clear from this that rites cannot lead to Freedom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Therefore let the wise one strive after Freedom, giving up all longing for sensual self-indulgence; approaching the good, great Teacher (the Higher Self), with soul intent on the object of the teaching. Let him by the Self raise the Self, sunk in the ocean of the world, following the path of union through complete recognition of oneness. Setting all rites aside, let the wise, learned ones who approach the study of the Self strive for Freedom from the bondage of the world. Rites are to purify the thoughts, but not to gain the reality. The real is gained by Wisdom, not by a myriad of rites. When one steadily examines and clearly sees a rope, the fear that it is a serpent is destroyed. Knowledge is gained by discernment, by examining, by instruction, but not by bathing, nor gifts, nor a hundred holdings of the breath. Success demands first ripeness; questions of time and place are subsidiary. Let the seeker after self-knowledge find the Teacher (the Higher Self), full of kindness and knowledge of the Eternal.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                            <p>
                                Four perfections are numbered by the wise. When they are present there is success, but in their absence is failure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First is counted the Discernment between things lasting and unlasting. Next Dispassion, the indifference to self-indulgence here and in paradise. Then the Six Graces, beginning with Restfulness. Then the longing for Freedom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A certainty like this &ndash; the Eternal is real, the fleeting world is unreal; &ndash; this is that Discernment between things lasting and unlasting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And this is Dispassion &ndash; a perpetual willingness to give up all sensual self-indulgence &ndash; everything lower than the Eternal, through a constant sense of their insufficiency.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then the Six Graces: a steady intentness of the mind on its goal; &ndash; this is Restfulness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And the steadying of the powers that act and perceive, each in its own sphere, turning them back from sensuality; &ndash; this is Self-control.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then the raising of the mind above external things; &ndash; this is the true Withdrawal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The enduring of all ills without petulance and without self-pity; &ndash; this is the right Endurance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An honest confidence in the teaching and the Teacher; &ndash; this is that Faith by which the treasure is gained.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The intentness of the soul on the pure Eternal; &ndash; this is right Meditation, but not the indulgence of fancy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The wish to untie, by discernment of their true nature, all the bonds woven by unwisdom, the bonds of selfishness and sensuality; &ndash; this is the longing for Freedom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though at first imperfect, these qualities gradually growing through Dispassion, Restfulness, and the other graces and the Teacher's help will gain their due.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When Dispassion and longing for Freedom are strong, then Restfulness and the other graces will bear fruit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But when these two &ndash; Dispassion and longing for Freedom &ndash; are lacking, then Restfulness and the other graces are a mere appearance, like water in the desert.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Chief among the causes of Freedom is devotion, the intentness of the soul on its own nature. Or devotion may be called intentness on the reality of the Self.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let him who possesses these Perfections and who would learn the reality of the Self, approach the wise Teacher (the Higher Self), from whom comes the loosing of bonds; who is full of knowledge and perfect; who is not beaten by desire, who really knows the Eternal; who has found rest in the Eternal, at peace like a fuelless fire; who is full of selfless kindness, the friend of all that lives. Serving the Teacher with devotion and aspiration for the Eternal, and finding harmony with him, seek the needed knowledge of the Self.
                            </p>

                                By discerning the aim of the wisdom-teaching (Vedanta) <sup>[2]</sup> is born that most excellent knowledge. Then comes the final ending of the world's pain. The voice of the teaching plainly declares that faith, devotion, meditation, and the search for union are the means of Freedom for him who would be free. He who is perfect in these wins Freedom from the bodily bondage woven by unwisdom.
