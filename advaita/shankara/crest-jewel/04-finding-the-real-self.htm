							<h4>
								Bondage Through Imagination
							</h4>
							<p class="verses-number">
								Verses 269 - 276
							</p>
							<p>
								Recognizing as thine own the hidden Self, the witness of the soul and its activities, perceiving truly "That am I," destroy the thought of Self in all not Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Give up following after the world, give up following after the body, give up following after the ritual law; make an end of transferring selfhood to these.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through a man's imagination being full of the world, through his imagination being full of the ritual law, through his imagination being full of the body, wisdom, truly, is not born in him.
							</p>
							<p>
								For him who seeks freedom from the grasping hand of birth and death, an iron fetter binding his feet, say they who know it, is this potent triad of imaginings; he who has got free from this enters into freedom.
							</p>
							<p>
								The scent of sandalwood that drives all evil odors away comes forth through stirring it with water and the like; all other odors are driven altogether away.
							</p>
							<p>
								The image of the supreme Self, stained by the dust of imaginings, dwelling inwardly, endless, evil, comes forth pure, by the stirring power of enlightenment, as the scent of the sandalwood comes forth clear.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the net of imaginings of things not Self, the image of the Self is held back; by resting on the eternal Self, their destruction comes, and the Self shines clear.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the mind rests more and more on the Self behind it, it is more and more freed from outward imaginings; when imaginings are put away, and no residue left, he enters and becomes the Self, pure of all bonds.

							<h4>
								Selfhood Transferred to Things Not Self
							</h4>
							<p class="verses-number">
								Verses 277 - 287
							</p>
							<p>
								By resting ever in the Self, the restless mind of him who seeks union is stilled, and all imaginings fade away; therefore make an end of transferring Selfhood to things not Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Darkness is put away through force and substantial being; force, through substantial being; in the pure, substantial being is not put away; therefore, relying on substantial being, make an end of transferring Selfhood to things not Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								The body of desire is nourished by all new works begun; steadily thinking on this, and effortfully holding desire firm, make an end of transferring selfhood to things not Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thinking: "I am not this separate life but the supreme Eternal," beginning by rejecting all but this, make an end of transferring selfhood to things not Self; it comes from the swift impetus of imaginings.
							</p>
							<p>
								Understanding the all-selfhood of the Self, by learning, seeking union, entering the Self, make an end of transferring selfhood to things not Self; it comes from the Self's reflected light in other things.
							</p>
							<p>
								Neither in taking nor giving does the sage act at all; therefore by ever resting on the One, make an end of transferring selfhood to things not Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through sentences like "That thou art" awaking to the oneness of the Eternal and the Self, to confirm the Self in the Eternal, make an end of transferring selfhood to things not Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								While there yet lingers a residue undissolved of the thought that this body is the Self, carefully seeking union with the Self, make an end of transferring selfhood to things not Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								As long as the thought of separate life and the world shines, dreamlike even, so long incessantly, O wise one, make an end of transferring selfhood to things not Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								The body of desire, born of father and mother of impure elements, made up of fleshly things impure, is to be abandoned as one abandons an impure man afar; gain thy end by becoming the Eternal.

							<h4>
								The Real in Things Unreal
							</h4>
							<p class="verses-number">
								Verses 288 - 298
							</p>
							<!-- next could be 288 -->
							<p>
								As the space in a jar in universal space, so the Self is to be merged without division in the Self supreme; rest thou ever thus, O sage.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through the separate self gaining the Self, self-shining as a resting-place, let all outward things from a world-system to a lump of clay be abandoned, like a vessel of impure water.
							</p>
							<p>
								Raising the thought of "I" from the body to the Self that is Consciousness, Being, Bliss, and lodging it there, leave form, and become pure for ever.
							</p>
							<!-- next is 291 -->
							<p>
								Knowing that "I am that Eternal" wherein this world is reflected, like a city in a mirror, thou shalt perfectly gain thy end.
							</p>
							<p>
								What is of real nature, self-formed, original consciousness, secondless bliss, formless, actless &ndash; entering that, let a man put off this false body of desires, worn by the Self as a player puts on a costume.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the Self, all that is seen is but mirage; it lasts but for a moment, we see, and know it is not "I"; how could "I know all" be said of the personal self that changes every moment?
							</p>
							<p>
								The real "I" is witness of the personal self and its powers; as its being is perceived always, even in dreamless sleep. The scripture says the Self is unborn, everlasting; this is the hidden Self, distinguished neither as what exists nor what has no existence.
							</p>
							<p>
								The beholder of every change in things that change, can be the unchanging alone; in the mind's desires, in dreams, in dreamless sleep the insubstantial nature of things that change is clearly perceived again and again.
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore put away the false selfhood of this fleshly body, for the false selfhood of the body is built up by thought; knowing the Self as thine own, unhurt by the three times, undivided illumination, enter into peace.
							</p>
							<p>
								Put away the false selfhood of family and race and name, of form and rank, for these dwell in this body; put away the actorhood and other powers of the body of form; become the Self whose self is partless joy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Other bonds of man are seen, causes of birth and death, but the root and first form of them is selfishness.
