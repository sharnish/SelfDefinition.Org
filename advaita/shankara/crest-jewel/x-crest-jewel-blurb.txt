The Crest-Jewel of Wisdom, Vivekachudamani

Traditionally attributed to Adi Shankaracharya, 8th Century 

"There is no higher cause of joy than silence where no mind-pictures dwell; it belongs to him who has understood the Self's own being; who is full of the essence of the bliss of the Self.

"Whether walking or standing, sitting or lying down, or wherever he may be, let the sage dwell according to his will, the wise man finding joy ever within himself. "
