								Verses 469 - 518
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Teacher Speaks
							</h5>
							<p>
								That, whose nature no man can define; where is no pasturage for mind or word; one, verily, without second, is the Eternal; there is no difference at all.
							</p>
							<p>
								The fullness of Being, self-perfect, pure, awakened, unlike aught here; one, verily, without second, is the Eternal; there is no difference at all!
							</p>
							<p>
								They who have cast away passion, who have cast away sensual delights, peaceful, well-ruled, the sages, the mighty, knowing reality in the supreme consummation, have gained the highest joy in union with the Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thou worthy one also, seeking this higher reality of the Self, whose whole nature is the fullness of bliss, washing away the delusions thine own mind has built up, be free, gaining thy end, perfectly awakened.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through Soul-vision, through the Self utterly unshaken, behold the Self's reality, by the clear eye of awakening; if the word of the scripture is perfectly perceived without wavering, then doubt arises no more.
							</p>
							<p>
								On gaining freedom from the bonds bound by unwisdom as to the Self; in the gaining of that Self whose nature is truth, knowledge, bliss; the holy books, reason, and the word of the guide are one's evidences; an evidence too is the realizing of the Self, inwardly attained.
							</p>
							<p>
								Freedom from bondage and joy, health of thought and happiness, are to be known by one's self; the knowing of others is but inference.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the teachers, who have reached the further shore, and the teachings tell, let a man cross over through that enlightenment which comes through the will of the higher Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Knowing the Self through one's own realization, as one's own partless Self, and being perfected, let him stand firm in the unwavering Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the last and final word of the teaching: The Eternal is the individual life and the whole world; rest in the partless One is freedom, in the Eternal, the secondless; and this too the scriptures show.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through the word of the Guide, and the evidence of the teaching, understanding the highest Being, through union with the Self, he reached perfect peace, intent on the Self, so that nothing could disturb him any more, resting altogether in the Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Then after intending his mind for a while on the supreme Eternal, rising again from the highest bliss he spoke this word: [480]
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Pupil Speaks
							</h5>
							<p>
								Entangling thought has fallen away, its activity has dissolved, through mastery of the Self's oneness with the Eternal; I know not this, nor anything that is not this; for what is it? how great is it? joy is its further shore.
							</p>
							<p>
								This cannot be spoken by voice, nor thought by mind; I taste the glory of the ocean of the Supreme Eternal, filled full of the ambrosial bliss of the Self. My mind, enjoying delight, like a watercourse, that had dried up, when the multitude of waters come, is full of happiness, even from the slightest portion of the honey-sweet bliss of the Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Whither has this world of sorrow gone? what has taken it away? whither has it dissolved? Now I see that it no longer is &ndash; a mighty wonder!
							</p>
							<p>
								What is there for me to reject? what to choose? what else exists? Where is there difference in the mighty ocean of the Eternal, full of the nectar of partless bliss?
							</p>
							<p>
								I see not, nor hear, nor know aught of this world; for I bear the mark of the Self, whose form is being and bliss.
							</p>
							<p>
								Honor, honor to thee, my Guide, mighty-souled; to thee, who art free from sensuous bondage, who art most excellent, whose own nature is the essence of bliss of the secondless Everlasting, whose words are ever a mighty, shoreless ocean of pity.
							</p>
							<p>
								As one who was wearied with the heat, bathing himself and refreshed, in the enveloping light of the rayed moon, thus I have in a moment gained the partless excellent bliss, the imperishable word, the Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Rich am I, I have done what was to be done, freed am I from the grasp of the sorrowing world. My own being is everlasting bliss, I am filled full, through the favor of the Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unbound am I, formless am I, without distinction am I, no longer able to be broken; in perfect peace am I, and endless; I am stainless, immemorial.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am neither the doer nor enjoyer; mine are neither change nor act. I am in nature pure awakening. I am the lonely One, august for ever. [490]
							</p>
							<p>
								I am apart from the personal self that sees, hears, speaks, acts, and enjoys; everlasting, innermost, without act; the limitless, unbound, perfect Self awakened.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am neither this nor that; I am even he who illumines both, the supreme, the pure; for me is neither inner nor outer, for I am the perfect, secondless Eternal.
							</p>
							<p>
								The unequalled, beginningless reality is far from the thought of I and thou, of this and that; I am the one essence of everlasting bliss, the real, the secondless Eternal.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am the Creator, I am he who makes an end of hell, he who makes an end of all things old; I am the Spirit, I am the Lord; I am partless awakening, the endless witness; for me there is no longer any Lord, no longer I nor mine.
							</p>
							<p>
								For I, verily, consist in all beings, enveloping them within and without, through the Self that knows; I myself am at once the enjoyer and all that is to be enjoyed &ndash; whatever was seen before as separate &ndash; through identity with it.
							</p>
							<p>
								In me, the ocean of partless Bliss, world-waves rise manifold, and fall again, through the storm-winds of glamor's magic.
							</p>
							<p>
								In me, the material and other worlds are built up by glamor, through swift vibrations; just as in Time which has neither part nor division, are built up the world-periods, the years, the seasons, months, and days.
							</p>
							<p>
								Nor does the Self, on which the worlds are built, become stained by them, even through the deluded who are stained by many sins; just as even a mighty flood of mirage waters wets not the salt desert earth.
							</p>
							<p>
								Like the ether, I spread throughout the world; like the sun, I am marked by my shining; like the hills, I am everlasting and unmoved; I am like an ocean without shores.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am not bound by the body, as the clear sky is not bound by clouds; whence then should the characters of waking, dreaming, dreamlessness, belong to me? [500]
							</p>
							<p>
								The veil comes, and, verily, departs again; it alone performs works and enjoys them. It alone wastes away and dies, while I stand like a mighty mountain, forever unmoved.
							</p>
							<p>
								Neither forth-going nor return belong to me, whose form is ever one, without division. He who is the one Self, without fissure or separation, perfect like the ether &ndash; how can he strive or act?
							</p>
							<p>
								How should righteousness or sin belong to me, who possess not the powers of sense, who am above emotion, above form and change, who experience ever partless bliss; for the scripture teaches that in the Self is neither righteousness nor sin.
							</p>
							<p>
								What is touched by his shadow, whether heat or cold, or foul or fair, touches not at all the man, who is other than his shadow.
							</p>
							<p>
								The natures of things beheld touch not the beholder, who is apart from them, sitting above unchanged, as the character of the house affects not the lamp.
							</p>
							<p>
								Like the sun which witnesses the act, like the tongued flame that leads the conflagration, like the rope that holds what is raised; thus am I, standing on the summit, the conscious Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am neither the actor, nor the causer of acts; I am neither he who enjoys, nor he who brings enjoyment; I am neither the seer, nor he who gives sight; I am the unequalled Self, self-luminous.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the disguise moves, just as the foolish-minded attribute to the sun the dancing of its reflection on the water, so one thinks: I am the doer, the enjoyer; I, also, am slain.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let this inert body move on the waters or on dry land; I am not thereby stained by their natures, as the ether is not stained by the nature of a jar.
							</p>
							<p>
								Acting, enjoying, baseness or madness, inertness or bondage or unloosing are the changes of the mind, and belong not really to the Self, the supreme Eternal, the pure, the secondless. [510]
							</p>
							<p>
								Let Nature suffer changes ten times, a hundred, a thousand times; what have I to do with these commotions? For the lowering clouds touch not the sky.
							</p>
							<p>
								From the unmanifest, down to grossest things, all this world encountered is a mere reflection only. Like the ether, subtle, without beginning or end, is the secondless Eternal; and what that is, I am.
							</p>
							<p>
								All-embracing, illumining all things; under all forms all-present, yet outside all; everlasting, pure, unmoved, unchanging, is the secondless Eternal; and what that is, I am.
							</p>
							<p>
								Where the differences made by glamor have sunk to final setting, of hidden nature, perceived in secret, the Real, Wisdom, Bliss, and formed of bliss, is the secondless Eternal; and what that is, I am.
							</p>
							<p>
								Without act am I, without change, without division, without form; without wavering am I, everlasting am I, resting on naught else, and secondless.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am altogether the Self, I am the All; I transcend all; there is none but me. I am pure, partless awakening; I too am unbroken bliss.
							</p>
							<p>
								This sovereignty, self-rule, and mighty power, through the goodness of thy pity, power, and might, has been gained by me, my guide, great-souled; honor, honor to thee, and yet again honor.
							</p>
							<p>
								In that great dream that glamor makes, in that forest of birth and age and death, I wander wearying; daily stricken by the heat, and haunted by the tiger of selfishness; thou hast saved me, my guide, by waking me out of sleep. [518]
