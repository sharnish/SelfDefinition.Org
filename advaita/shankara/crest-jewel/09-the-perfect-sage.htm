							<h4>
								The Perfect Sage
							</h4>
							<p class="verses-number">
								Verses 519 - 548
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Pupil Speaks
							</h5>
							<p>
								Honor to that one Being, wherever it is; honor to the Light which shines through the form of all that is; and to thee king of teachers!
							</p>
							<p>
								Beholding him thus paying honor &ndash; a pupil full of worth, full of the joy of soul-vision, awakened to reality &ndash; that king of instructors, rejoicing in his heart, that mighty souled one, addressed to him this final word:
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Teacher Speaks
							</h5>
							<p>
								This world is the offspring of the Eternal's thought; thus, verily, the Eternal is the Real in all things. Behold it thus by the vision of the higher Self, with mind full of peace, in every mode of being. A certain Being, apart from form, is seen everywhere, of those who have eyes to see. Therefore knowers of the Eternal understand that whatever is other than this, is but the sport and workmanship of intellect.
							</p>
							<p>
								Who, being wise, and tasting that essence of supreme bliss, would delight any more in things of emptiness? Who desires to look on a painted moon, when the moon, the giver of delight, is shining?
							</p>
							<p>
								For through enjoyment of unreal things, there is no contentment at all, nor any getting rid of pain. Therefore contented by enjoying the essence of secondless bliss, stand thou rejoicing, resting on the Self that is true Being.
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore beholding thyself everywhere, and considering thyself as secondless, let the time go by for thee, mighty minded one, rejoicing in the bliss that is thine own.
							</p>
							<p>
								And wavering doubt in the Self of partless awakening which wavers not, is but of fancy's building; therefore through the Self which is formed of secondless bliss, entering into lasting peace, adore in silence.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the silence is the highest peace, because wavering is the intellect's unreal work; there the knowers of the Eternal, mighty-souled, enjoy unbroken happiness of partless bliss, recognizing the Self as the Eternal.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is no higher cause of joy than silence where no mind-pictures dwell; it belongs to him who has understood the Self's own being; who is full of the essence of the bliss of the Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Whether walking or standing, sitting or lying down, or wherever he may be, let the sage dwell according to his will, the wise man finding joy ever within himself.
							</p>
							<p>
								No distinctions of place or time, position or space are to be regarded as bringing release from bondage, for the mighty-souled, who has perfectly attained to reality. Of what avail are the rites of religion for one who has attained to wisdom?
							</p>
							<p>
								What religious rite will help one to know a jar, without having perceived it? But where there is direct perception, the object is perfectly understood. [530]
							</p>
							<p>
								So when there is direct perception, the Self shines forth clearly, without regard to place or time or rites of purification.
							</p>
							<p>
								The direct knowledge, that "I am Devadatta," depends on nothing else; and it is precisely thus with the knowledge that "I am the Eternal," in the case of the knower of the Eternal.
							</p>
							<p>
								How could the not Self, the mere chaff of unreality, be the illuminer of that through the radiance of which the whole world shines, as through the sun?
							</p>
							<p>
								How can the scriptures or laws or traditions, or even all beings, illumine that by which alone they gain their worth?
							</p>
							<p>
								This Self, self-illumined, is of unending power, immeasurable, the direct knowledge of all; knowing this, the knower of the Eternal, freed from bondage, most excellent, gains the victory.
							</p>
							<p>
								Things of sense neither distress nor elate him beyond measure, nor is he attached to, or repelled by them; in the Self he ever joys, the Self is his rejoicing; altogether contented by the essence of uninterrupted bliss.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a child, who is free from hunger and bodily pain, finds delight in play, so the wise man rejoices, free from the sorrow of "I" and "mine."
							</p>
							<p>
								His food is what is freely offered, eaten without anxiety or sense of poverty; his drink is the pure water of the streams; he moves where fancy leads him, unconstrained; he sleeps by the river-bank, or in the wood; for his vesture is one that grows not old or worn; his home is space; his couch, the world; he moves in paths where the beaten road is ended; the wise man, delighting in the supreme Eternal.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dwelling in this body as a mere temporary halting-place, he meets the things of sense just as they come, like a child subject to another's will; thus lives the knower of the Self, who shows no outward sign, nor is attached to external things.
							</p>
							<p>
								Whether clothed in space alone, or wearing other vestures, or clothed in skins, or in a vesture of thought; like one in trance, or like a child, or like a shade, he walks the earth. [540]
							</p>
							<p>
								Withdrawing desire from the things of desire, ever contented in the Self, the sage stands firm through the Self alone.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now as a fool, now a wise man; now as a great and wealthy king; now a wanderer, now a sage; now dwelling like a serpent, solitary; now full of honor; now rejected and unknown; thus the sage walks, ever rejoicing in perfect bliss.
							</p>
							<p>
								Though without wealth, contented ever; ever rejoicing, though without sensuous enjoyments; though not like others, yet ever seeming as the rest.
							</p>
							<p>
								Ever active, though acting not at all; though tasting no experience, yet experiencing all; bodiless, though possessing a body; though limited, yet penetrating all.
							</p>
							<p>
								This knower of the Eternal, ever bodiless, things pleasant or painful touch not at all, nor things fair or foul.
							</p>
							<p>
								For pleasure and pain, things fair and foul, are for him who is bound by the vestures, who believes them real; but for him whose bonds are broken, for the sage whose Self is real Being, what fruit is fair, or what is foul?
							</p>
							<p>
								Just as in an eclipse of the sun, people say, "the sun is darkened," though the sun indeed is not darkened, and they speak ignorantly, knowing not the truth of things.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thus verily they behold the most excellent knower of Brahma as though bound to a body, while he is in truth freed for ever from the body, and they are deluded by the mere seeming of the body. [548]
