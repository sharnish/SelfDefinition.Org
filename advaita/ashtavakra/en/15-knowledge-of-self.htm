								Ashtavakra said &ndash;
							</p>
							<p>
								1. A man of pure intellect realizes the Self even by instruction casually imparted. A man of impure intellect is bewildered in trying to realize the Self even after enquiring throughout life.
							</p>
							<p>
								2.&nbsp;Non-attachment for sense-objects is liberation; love for sense-objects is bondage. Such verily is Knowledge. Now do as you please.
							</p>
							<p>
								3.&nbsp;This knowledge of the Truth makes an eloquent, wise and active person mute, inert and inactive. Therefore it is shunned by those who want to enjoy the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								4.&nbsp;You are not the body, nor is the body yours; you are not the doer nor the enjoyer. You are Consciousness itself, the Eternal Witness, and free. Get about happily.
							</p>
							<p>
								5.&nbsp;Attachment and abhorrence are attributes of the mind. The mind is never yours. You are Intelligence itself, free from conflict, and changeless. Get about happily.
							</p>
							<p>
								6.&nbsp;Realizing the Self in all and all in the Self, free from egoism and free from the sense of 'mine,' be you happy.
							</p>
							<p>
								7.&nbsp;You are indeed That in which the universe manifests itself like waves on the ocean. O you Intelligence, be you free from the fever of the mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								8.&nbsp;Have faith, my son, have faith. Never confuse yourself in this. You are Knowledge itself, you are the Lord, you are the Self, and you are beyond Nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								9.&nbsp;The body, composed of the ingredients of nature, comes, stays and goes. The Self neither comes nor goes. Why, then, do you mourn it?
							</p>
							<p>
								10.&nbsp;Let the body last to the end of kalpa (cycle) or let it go even today. Where is there any increase or decrease in you who are Pure Intelligence?
							</p>
							<p>
								11.&nbsp;In you who are the infinite Ocean, let the waves of the universe rise or fall according to their own nature. That means no gain or loss to you.
							</p>
							<p>
								12.&nbsp;My child, you are Pure Intelligence itself. This universe is nothing different from you. Therefore how and where can anyone have the idea of acceptance or rejection?
							</p>
							<p>
								13.&nbsp;From where will there be birth, action and even egoism for you who are One, immutable, calm, stainless, and Pure Consciousness?
							</p>
							<p>
								14.&nbsp;You alone appear as whatever you perceive. Do bracelets, armlets and anklets appear different from gold?
							</p>
							<p>
								15.&nbsp;Completely give up such distinctions as 'I am He' and 'I am not this.' Consider all as the Self and be desireless and happy.
							</p>
							<p>
								16.&nbsp;It is through your ignorance alone that the universe exists. In reality you are One. There is no individual self or Supreme Self other than you.
							</p>
							<p>
								17.&nbsp;One who knows for certain that this universe is but an illusion and a nothing, becomes desireless and Pure Intelligence, and finds peace as if nothing exists.
							</p>
							<p>
								18.&nbsp;In the ocean of the world One only was, is and will be. You have neither bondage nor liberation. Live contented and happily.
							</p>
							<p>
								19.&nbsp;O Pure Intelligence, do not disturb your mind with affirmations and negations. Be calm and abide happily in your own self which is Bliss itself.
							</p>
							<p>
								20. Completely give up even contemplation and hold nothing in your mind. You are verily the Self, free. What will you do by thinking?
