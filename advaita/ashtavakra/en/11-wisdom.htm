								Ashtavakra said &ndash;
							</p>
							<p>
								1. He who has realized that change in the form of existence and destruction is in the nature of things, easily finds repose, being unperturbed and free from pain.
							</p>
							<p>
								2.&nbsp;He who has known for certain that Iswara is the creator of all and that there is none else here, becomes peaceful with all his inner desires set at rest, and is not attached to anything whatsoever.
							</p>
							<p>
								3.&nbsp;He who has known for certain that adversity and prosperity come in their own time through the effects of past actions is ever contented, has all his senses under control, and neither desires nor grieves.
							</p>
							<p>
								4.&nbsp;He who knows for certain that happiness and misery, birth and death are due to the effects of past actions, does not find anything to accomplish, and thus becomes free from care and is not attached even though engaged in action.
							</p>
							<p>
								5.&nbsp;He who has realized that is care and nothing else that breeds misery in this world, becomes free from it, and is happy, peaceful and everywhere rid of desires.
							</p>
							<p>
								6.&nbsp;&quot;I am not the body, nor is the body mine. I am Consciousness itself&quot; &nbsp; he who has realized this for certain, does not remember what he has done or not done as if he has attained the state of Absoluteness.
							</p>
							<p>
								7.&nbsp;&quot;I am indeed in everything, from Brahma down to a clump of grass,&quot; &ndash; he who knows this for certain, becomes free from conflict of thought, pure and peaceful, and free from care for what is attained and not attained.
							</p>
							<p>
								8.&nbsp;He who knows for certain that this manifold and wonderful universe is nothing, becomes desireless and Pure Consciousness, and finds peace as if nothing exists.
