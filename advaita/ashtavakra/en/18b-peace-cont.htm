								51.&nbsp;All the modifications of the mind are destroyed when a man realizes that he himself is neither the doer nor the enjoyer.
							</p>
							<p>
								52.&nbsp;The conduct of the wise one, which is unrestricted by motive, shines, being free from pretence; but not the affected calmness of the deluded person whose mind is attached.
							</p>
							<p>
								53.&nbsp;The wise who are free from mental projections, unbound and of unfettered intellect, sometimes sport in the midst of great enjoyments, and sometimes retire into mountain caves.
							</p>
							<p>
								54.&nbsp;No desire whatsoever springs in the heart of the wise one on honouring a person versed in sacred learning, a god, a holy place, or on seeing a woman, a king or a beloved one.
							</p>
							<p>
								55.&nbsp;The yogi is not at all perturbed even when ridiculed and despised by his servants, sons, wives, daughter's sons and other relations.
							</p>
							<p>
								56.&nbsp;Though pleased he is not pleased, though pained he does not suffer any pain. Only those like him understand his wonderful state.
							</p>
							<p>
								57.&nbsp;The sense of duty, indeed, is the world of relativity. It is transcended by the wise who realizes himself as all-pervasive, formless, immutable, and untainted.
							</p>
							<p>
								58.&nbsp;One of dull intellect, even without doing anything, is ever agitated by distraction; but the skilful one, even doing his duties, is verily unperturbed.
							</p>
							<p>
								59.&nbsp;With perfect equanimity, even in practical life, the wise one sits happily, sleeps happily, moves happily, speaks happily, and eats happily.
							</p>
							<p>
								60.&nbsp;Whoever, by virtue of the realization of his own self, does not feel distressed even in practical life like ordinary people, and remains unagitated, like a vast lake, with all his sorrows gone &nbsp; he shines.
							</p>
							<p>
								61.&nbsp;With the deluded, even inaction becomes action, and with the wise, even action results in the fruit of inaction.
							</p>
							<p>
								62.&nbsp;The deluded one often shows aversion for his possessions. Where is attachment, where is aversion for him whose love for the body has vanished?
							</p>
							<p>
								63.&nbsp;The consciousness of the deluded one is always attached to thinking and not-thinking. But the consciousness of the wise one, though attended with thinking the thinkable, is of the nature of unconsciousness.
							</p>
							<p>
								64.&nbsp;The wise one who has no motive in all his actions, who moves like a child and is pure, has no attachment even to the work that is being done by him.
							</p>
							<p>
								65.&nbsp;Blessed indeed is that knower of Self, who has transcended the mind, and who, even though seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, or eating, is the same under all conditions.
							</p>
							<p>
								66.&nbsp;Where is the world and where its appearance, where is the end, and where the means for the wise one who is ever changeless like the firmament?
							</p>
							<p>
								67.&nbsp;Glorious is he who is free from all desires, who is the embodiment of bliss which is his own nature, and who is spontaneously absorbed in the unconditioned Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								68.&nbsp;In short, the great-souled one who has realized the Truth is free from the desire of enjoyment and liberation and is devoid of all attachment at all times and in all places.
							</p>
							<p>
								69.&nbsp;What remains to be done by one who is Pure Consciousness? He has renounced phenomenal existence which begins with mahat and is manifested through mere name?
							</p>
							<p>
								70.&nbsp;The pure one knows for certain that this universe is the product of illusion and that nothing exists. The Imperceptible Self is revealed to him, and he naturally enjoys peace.
							</p>
							<p>
								71.&nbsp;Rule of conduct, dispassion, renunciation and restraint of the senses-- what are these to one who is of the nature of Pure effulgence and who does not perceive any objective reality?
							</p>
							<p>
								72.&nbsp;Where is the bondage or liberation, joy or sorrow for one who shines as the Infinite and does not perceive relative existence?
							</p>
							<p>
								73.&nbsp;Only the illusion of the world prevails. The reality of the world vanishes with the knowledge of the Self. The wise one lives without the feeling of &quot;I-ness&quot;, and &quot;mine-ness&quot;, and attachment.
							</p>
							<p>
								74.&nbsp;To the wise one who perceives the Self as imperishable and free from grief, where is knowledge, where is the universe? Where is the feeling &quot;I am the body&quot; or &quot;the body is mine&quot;?
							</p>
							<p>
								75.&nbsp;No sooner does the man of dull intellect give up such practices as mind-control, than he becomes a prey to desires and fancies.
							</p>
							<p>
								76.&nbsp;Even hearing the Truth, the man of dull intellect does not give up his delusion. Though, through suppression, he appears devoid of mental activity, a craving for sense-objects lurks within him.
							</p>
							<p>
								77.&nbsp;He whose work has ceased with the dawn of Knowledge, does not find any opportunity to do or say anything, even though in ordinary people's eyes he is doing work.
							</p>
							<p>
								78.&nbsp;For the wise one who is ever immutable and fearless, where is there darkness, where light? Where, moreover, is there any loss? There is nothing whatsoever.
							</p>
							<p>
								79.&nbsp;Where is patience, where is discrimination, and where, even, is fearlessness for the yogin who is impersonal and of indescribable nature?
							</p>
							<p>
								80.&nbsp;There is no heaven, and there is no hell; there is not even liberation-in-life. In short, nothing exists in yogic consciousness.
							</p>
							<p>
								81.&nbsp;The wise one neither longs for gain nor grieves at non-attachment. His cool mind is verily filled with nectar.
							</p>
							<p>
								82.&nbsp;The desireless one neither praises the calm nor blames even the wicked. Contented and same in happiness and misery, he finds nothing to be done.
							</p>
							<p>
								83.&nbsp;This wise one neither abhors birth and death nor wishes to perceive the Self. Free from joy and sorrow, he is neither dead nor alive.
							</p>
							<p>
								84.&nbsp;Glorious is the life of the wise one, free from expectation, free from attachment for children, wife, and others, free from desire for the object of senses, and free from the care of even his own body.
							</p>
							<p>
								85.&nbsp;Contentment ever dwells in the heart of the wise one who lives on whatever happens to come to him, and who wanders about at pleasure, resting wherever he is when the sun sets.
							</p>
							<p>
								86.&nbsp;Reposing on the foundation of his own being, and completely transcending birth and rebirth, the great-souled person does not cares whether his body dies or is born.
							</p>
							<p>
								87.&nbsp;Blessed is the wise one who stands alone, who is attached to nothing, who is without any possession, who moves freely and at pleasure, who is free from the pairs of opposites, and whose doubts have been rent asunder.
							</p>
							<p>
								88.&nbsp;Glorious is the wise one who is devoid of the feelings of &quot;mine&quot;, to whom earth, a stone and gold are all the same, the knots of whose heart have been rent asunder, and who has been purged of rajas and tamas.
							</p>
							<p>
								89.&nbsp;Who is there to stand comparison with the liberated soul who has no desire whatsoever at heart, who is contented and indifferent to everything?
							</p>
							<p>
								90.&nbsp;Who but the desireless one knows not though knowing, sees not though seeing, and speaks not though speaking?
							</p>
							<p>
								91.&nbsp;Be he a mendicant or a king, he excels who is unattached and whose view of things has been freed from the sense of good and evil.
							</p>
							<p>
								92.&nbsp;Where is wantonness, where is restraint, and where is determination of Truth for the yogin whose life's object has been fulfilled and who is the embodiment of guileless sincerity?
							</p>
							<p>
								93.&nbsp;How and to whom can be described what is experienced within by one who is desireless, whose sorrow is destroyed, and who is contented with repose in the Self?
							</p>
							<p>
								94.&nbsp;Not asleep, even when sleeping soundly; not lying down, even when dreaming; and not awake, even in the waking state; such is the wise one who is contented under all conditions.
							</p>
							<p>
								95.&nbsp;The man of Knowledge is devoid of thought, even when he is engaged in thought; he is devoid of the sense-organs, even though he has them; he is devoid of intelligence, even though endowed with it; and he is devoid of the sense of ego, even though possessed of it.
							</p>
							<p>
								96.&nbsp;The man of Knowledge is neither happy nor miserable, neither attached nor unattached, neither liberated nor an aspirant for liberation, he is neither this nor that.
							</p>
							<p>
								97.&nbsp;The blessed one is not distracted even in distraction; he is not meditative even in meditation; he is not dull even in a state of dullness; and he is not learned even though possessed of learning.
							</p>
							<p>
								98.&nbsp;The liberated one who abides in the Self under all conditions, who is free from the idea of action and of duty, and who is the same everywhere, does not, owing to desirelessness, reflect upon what he has or has not done.
							</p>
							<p>
								99.&nbsp;Praised, the wise one does not feel pleased; and blamed, he does not feel annoyed. He neither rejoices in life nor fears death.
							</p>
							<p>
								100.&nbsp;The tranquil-minded one seeks neither the crowded place nor the wilderness. He remains the same under any conditions and in any place.
