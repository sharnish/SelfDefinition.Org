								Janaka said &ndash;
							</p>
							<p>
								1.&nbsp;Oh, I am spotless, tranquil, Pure Consciousness, and beyond Nature. All this time I have been mocked by illusion.
							</p>
							<p>
								2.&nbsp;As I alone reveal this body, even so do I reveal this universe. Therefore mine is all this universe, or verily nothing is mine.
							</p>
							<p>
								3.&nbsp;Oh, having renounced the universe together with the body, I now perceive the Supreme Self through the secret of wisdom.
							</p>
							<p>
								4.&nbsp;As waves, foam and bubbles are not different from water, so the universe emanating from the Self is not different from It.
							</p>
							<p>
								5.&nbsp;As cloth, when analyzed, is found to be nothing but thread, so this universe, when analyzed, is nothing but the Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								6.&nbsp;Just as sugar generated in sugarcane juice is wholly pervaded by that juice, so the universe produced in Me is permeated by Me through and through.
							</p>
							<p>
								7.&nbsp;The world appears from the ignorance of the Self and disappears with the knowledge of the Self, just as the snake appears from the non-cognition of the rope and disappears with its recognition.
							</p>
							<p>
								8.&nbsp;Light is my very nature and I am no other than light. When the universe manifests itself, verily then it is I that shine.
							</p>
							<p>
								9.&nbsp;O, the universe appears in me, conceived through ignorance, just as silver appears in the mother of pearl, a snake in the rope, and water in the sunbeam.
							</p>
							<p>
								10.&nbsp;Just as a jug dissolves into clay, a wave into water, or a bracelet into gold, so the universe which has emanated from me will dissolve into me.
							</p>
							<p>
								11.&nbsp;Wonderful am I! Adoration to myself who know no decay and survive even the destruction of the world, from Brahma down to a clump of grass.
							</p>
							<p>
								12.&nbsp;Wonderful am I! Adoration to myself who, though with a body, am One, who neither go anywhere nor come from anywhere but abide pervading the universe.
							</p>
							<p>
								13.&nbsp;Wonderful am I! Adoration to myself! There is none so capable as I, who am bearing the universe for all eternity without touching it with the body.
							</p>
							<p>
								14.&nbsp;Wonderful am I! Adoration to myself who have nothing or have all that is thought and spoken of.
							</p>
							<p>
								15.&nbsp;Knowledge, knower and the knowable &ndash; these three do not exist in reality. I am that stainless Self in which this triad appears through ignorance.
							</p>
							<p>
								16.&nbsp;Oh, the root of misery is duality. There is no other remedy for it except the realization that all objects of experience are unreal and that I am pure, One, Consciousness, and Bliss.
							</p>
							<p>
								17.&nbsp;I am pure Consciousness. Through ignorance I have imposed limitations upon myself. Constantly reflecting in this way, I am abiding in the Absolute.
							</p>
							<p>
								18.&nbsp;I have neither bondage nor freedom. Having lost its support, the illusion has ceased. Oh, the universe, though existing in me, does not in reality so exist.
							</p>
							<p>
								19.&nbsp;I have known for certain that the body and the universe are nothing and that the Atman is Pure Consciousness alone. So on what is it now possible to base imagination?
							</p>
							<p>
								20.&nbsp;Body, heaven and hell, bondage and freedom, as also fear, all these are mere imagination. What have I to do with all these &nbsp; I whose nature is Pure Consciousness?
							</p>
							<p>
								21.&nbsp;Oh, I do not find any duality. Even the multitude of human beings, therefore, has become like a wilderness. To what should I attach myself?
							</p>
							<p>
								22.&nbsp;I am not this body, nor have I a body. I am not Jiva, I am Pure Consciousness. This indeed was my bondage that I had thirst for life.
							</p>
							<p>
								23.&nbsp;Oh, in me, the limitless ocean, on the rising of the wind of the mind, diverse waves of worlds are produced forthwith.
							</p>
							<p>
								24.&nbsp;With the calming of the wind of the mind in the infinite ocean of myself, the ark of the universe, unfortunately for Jiva, the trader, meets destruction.
							</p>
							<p>
								25.&nbsp;How wonderful! In me, the shoreless ocean, the waves of individual selves, according to their nature, rise, strike each other, play for a time and disappear.
