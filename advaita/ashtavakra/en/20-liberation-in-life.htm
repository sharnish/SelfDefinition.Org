								Janaka said &ndash;
							</p>
							<p>
								1.&nbsp;Where are the elements, where is the body, where are the organs, and where is the mind; where is the void; where, too, is despair for me who am taintless by nature?
							</p>
							<p>
								2.&nbsp;Where are the scriptures, where is knowledge of the Self, where is the mind not attached to sense-objects, where is contentment, and where is desirelessness for me who am ever devoid of the sense of duality?
							</p>
							<p>
								3.&nbsp;Where is knowledge and where is ignorance; where is &quot;I&quot;, where is &quot;this&quot;, and where is &quot;mine&quot;; where is bondage and where is liberation? Where is an attribute to the nature of my self?
							</p>
							<p>
								4.&nbsp;Where are prarabdha karmas, where is liberation-in-life, and where is even liberation-at-death for me, the ever undifferentiated?
							</p>
							<p>
								5.&nbsp;Where is the doer or enjoyer, where is cessation of thought or the rising of thought, where is direct knowledge or reflected knowledge, for me who am ever Impersonal?
							</p>
							<p>
								6.&nbsp;Where is the world and where is the aspirant for liberation; where is the contemplative man and where is the man of Knowledge, where is the soul in bondage and where is the liberated soul for me who am non-dual by nature?
							</p>
							<p>
								7.&nbsp;Where are creation and destruction; where is the end and where the means; where are seeker and success for me abiding in my non-dual nature?
							</p>
							<p>
								8.&nbsp;Where is the knower, the means to knowledge, the object of knowledge or knowledge itself; where is anything, and where is nothing for me who am ever pure?
							</p>
							<p>
								9.&nbsp;Where is distraction, where is concentration; where is knowledge, where is delusion; where is joy and where is sorrow for me who am ever actionless?
							</p>
							<p>
								10.&nbsp;Where is relativity, where is transcendence; where is happiness or misery for me who am ever beyond any discursive thought?
							</p>
							<p>
								11.&nbsp;Where is illusion, where is the world; where is attachment or detachment; where is jiva or Brahman for me, who am ever pure?
							</p>
							<p>
								12.&nbsp;Where is activity, where is inactivity; where is liberation or bondage for me who am ever immutable and indivisible, and established in the Self?
							</p>
							<p>
								13.&nbsp;Where are instruction and scriptural injunction, where is the disciple and where is the preceptor; where, indeed, is the object of life for me who am absolute good and free from limitation?
							</p>
							<p>
								14.&nbsp;Where is existence, where is non-existence; where is unity, where is duality? What need is there to say more? Nothing emanates from me.
