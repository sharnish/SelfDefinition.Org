                                Who Is This &quot;I&quot;?
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Once upon a time there lived a person [a non grata] in a village called Andheri
                                [Darkness]. He, however, could establish a custom in courts of Law, that no order
                                or document be accepted as legal unless it bore the stamp, "Gomaji Ganesh" ["The
                                Brass Door"]. Afterwards, all the officers of that city accepted a document as legal
                                only if it bore this stamp on it. This procedure continued for a long time and thus
                                the stamp became firmly rooted in the city of Andheri. No one ever enquired as to
                                who this "Gomaji Ganesh" was.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But as time passed, it so happened that an important document which bore no stamp
                                of the "Gomaji Ganesh" was cited as evidence in a case filed in a court of law and
                                even though, as ordinary procedure goes it was thoroughly legal, it was still not
                                accepted as evidence. At that point, a courageous man, who was a party to the suit,
                                put before the judge the argument that the document was perfectly valid as it bore
                                all the signatures of all the relevant government officers. He argued, "Why should
                                this document not be admissible if it is otherwise perfectly legal? Why should it
                                have in addition this stamp of "Gomaji Ganesh"?" Thus, he questioned the legality
                                of the stamp itself, and in consequence, the legality of the stamp was made an issue
                                of contention. Till that day, no one had ventured to bring this issue before a court
                                of law. Since it had risen for the first time, it was decided that this point should
                                be brought to a decision as to what this fuss was all about.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So the judge, out of curiosity about the procedure of the "Gomaji Ganesh" stamp,
                                took the matter in hand first for enquiry. When the enquiry was complete, it showed
                                that some person of no status, taking advantage of the badly administered government,
                                had pushed in his own stamp and the government officers went on following this tradition
                                blindly. As a matter of fact, this Gomaji Ganesh was a man of no importance and
                                had no authority of any kind. It is not necessary to describe how this stamp was
                                looked upon with ridicule, since that day when the decision was taken by the court.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the same way, we should also enquire about who this "I" is, and how it dominates
                                everything as "I" and "mine", just like in the story concerning the "Gomaji Ganesh"
                                stamp. It is a general rule that if two people quarrel, it usually results in advantage
                                to the third party, or if two things get mixed up, some third thing is produced.
                                For example, by the contact of a piece of thread and flowers, a garland is produced
                                which was not there in the first place. Even the names of the parents [thread and
                                flowers] whose contact was responsible in producing a garland get eclipsed as soon
                                as the garland comes into existence. The garland itself is brought into prominence
                                and is known by its own label. The names "flowers" and "thread" become extinct because
                                a new name, "garland", is now evoked, and with this new name further actions take
                                place. With the contact of earth and water, both the earth and water become extinct
                                and mud arises as "I". So also, stones, bricks, mud and mason come together and
                                a third thing called a "wall" stands before the eyes. The stones, bricks, mud and
                                mason simply vanish from our sight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through the conveyance of knowledge and ignorance, this is how a peculiar thing
                                called an "intellect" comes into existence, and with this contact, emerges the "world".
                                Gold and a goldsmith produce a certain object with a certain form, and that thing
                                starts tempting our eyes as an "ornament". The gold and the goldsmith are forgotten.
                                As a matter of fact, if anyone is curious to find out if there is anything like
                                an ornament inside the gold, one would see nothing but gold! If we told a goldsmith
                                to make an ornament without touching any gold, what would he make? Actually, the
                                thing called an "ornament" would simply vanish into thin air.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the same way, due to the meeting of Brahma [the creator] and maya [the illusion],
                                this thief "I" has appeared, and proudly hums "I" while raising his head. This "I"
                                has uprooted both Brahma and maya. This barren women's [maya's] son ["I"] actually
                                never existed and yet tries to establish his unlimited sovereignty permanently in
                                the world. If we observe the parents of this "I", it would be clear that it is impossible
                                for them to get such an issue. The mother of the child is maya and does not exist.
                                From the womb of this maya, "I" has appeared and pretends to be born from pure existence.
                                But existence has no gender and does not even claim to possess the art of "doership".
                                So readers can imagine what kind of an "I" this is.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As described above, the existence of "I" is only in name and yet like Gomaji Ganesh,
                                he announces his own name while moving around everywhere and saying, "I am wise
                                and great!". This man has forgotten from where he came. Instead, he starts glorifying
                                himself as "I" and even if this glory is deserving, he is like a cat who laps up
                                milk with closed eyes, unaware of the stick that is ready to strike it on the back.
                                As soon as he accepts a right or privilege, he must also accept the responsibility
                                which goes along with it. As soon as I say that "I am the doer of a certain act"
                                I must enjoy the fruit of such an action. Enjoyment or sufferance of a fruit, or
                                result of an action is yoked to the action itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Actually there exists no one like "I" and the entire doership is contained in Reality.
                                Final Reality is so smart that the moment He finds that some pride of doership appears
                                as "I did it", He leaves all the responsibility of the action on the head of that
                                "I" and remains unattached. He leaves this poor "I" to it's destiny of revolving
                                on the wheel of birth and death.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Like in the above mentioned example of a "garland" being produced by the contact
                                of a piece of thread and flowers, when the garland dries up, nobody says that the
                                flowers dry up. Everyone says that it is the "garland" which dries up. And when
                                the thread snaps, everyone says that it is the "garland" which has snapped. It means
                                the doership of the original objects is imposed upon the third object due to the
                                pride of the object. In the same way, a series of miseries strike this non-existent
                                "I". If one wants to get free from this misery, one must leave that "I", but before
                                it is left, we will find out where exactly this "I" resides. And once we find him,
                                then we will talk about leaving him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Everyone should begin the search for this "I" at his own centre if he is keen to
                                find it. This "I" will never be found outside of us. In every human being this "I",
                                or ego-sense of "mine" and possession, is filled up to the brim. All the actions
                                in the world are carried on the strength of this ego-sense of "mine". This theorem
                                of "my action" is taken for granted by all human beings, but in fact the totality
                                of all actions can easily be carried out without this ego-sense. We shall see how
                                this can be done later on, but at present we shall enquire into this sense of "I"
                                and "mine". In order to make the search for "I" successful, we shall first look
                                into our gross physical body which has become very dear to us. After analysing it,
                                let us see if any such "I" is found to reside in this body.

                                What is a physical gross body? It is a collective assembly of parts or members such
                                as hands, feet, mouth, nose, ears, eyes, etc... We call the assembly of all these

                                one says, "The hand is "I"", and then if the hand is cut off, nobody says "I have
                                been cut off or discarded." Suppose the eyes go blind, no one says, "I am gone or
                                have disappeared." If the stomach is distended, no one says, "I am inflated." Instead,
                                one says, "My hand has been cut off", or "My eyes have gone blind", or "My stomach
                                is distended." All these parts are spoken of as being "mine", and not only that,
                                the body itself which is the assembly of all these members is also spoken of as
                                being "mine". Thus, this "I" is not any part or limb of the gross body. But the
                                maxim goes, "Where "I" does not exist, there does not exist anything which can be
                                called "mine"." You cannot be in the neighbours' house.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lets say that you go to the house of Rao Bahadur, your neighbour, and say "I am
                                Rao Bahadur and his wife is mine", you will see what experience you will get! If
                                you start making advances to his wife, saying that she is "yours", Rao Bahadur's
                                hand will immediately turn your cheek pink and red with a slap, and you will get
                                a sharp and sudden realisation that "I am not Rao Bahadur and his wife is not mine."
                                In the same way, when "I" cannot be traced anywhere in the body, then how can it
                                be said that the limbs of the body and its tendencies belong to me? If you still
                                insist on calling it your own, first think of the result [a slap], and ask yourself
                                whether it is really necessary to possess anything at all? See the result of such
                                thinking.
                            </p>

                                Everyday we see the condition of all the human beings who look upon their bodies
                                as their own and who act accordingly. The human being has forgotten his true Self
                                and does not even try to understand who he really is. Therefore, he must take birth
                                in every species. Sometimes he takes birth as a worm and is passed out in a stool.
                                Sometimes he takes birth as a bullock, he gets yoked to an oil extracting mechanism
                                and spends the day turning around in circles. Sometimes he takes birth as a donkey
                                and works hard while wallowing in a heap of garbage! It is almost impossible to
                                describe how many such miseries he has to suffer. After suffering births in all
                                the other species, at last one takes birth as a human being. In this birth he attains
                                an intellect, so that he should know God&mdash;the ultimate Self.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even if we look at the body of the human species, it merely looks like a dressed
                                up character in a vulgar play performed during the Shimga Festival. The character
                                has his face smeared with black paint and his body is dressed in rags. A garland
                                of shoes is placed around his neck and an umbrella made of shoes is held over his
                                head. He is placed on a donkey and is taken in a procession through the streets,
                                accompanied by weird noises. But this deity character takes pride in being the centre
                                of such a demeaning show and salutes the crowd as he passes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the same way, man's body is also a peculiar part of this passing show of life.
                                All the beauty of the face is supposed to be concentrated in the nose and eyes.
                                We say a man is handsome or a woman is beautiful if their nose and eyes are well-proportioned.
                                But in fact, the nose is only a tube for nasal discharge. The mouth is a spittoon
                                containing saliva and phlegm and the stomach is like the sewage depot of the municipality.
                                The body, which is a mixture of bone, flesh and blood, is given some respectable
                                name like "Shiral Seth". The Paramatman's intention is to awaken a human being by
                                demeaning him through this body. He makes the human being cry aloud for happiness
                                and wander about in all directions in search for it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In spite of this, the human being considers the body as a great gift and accepts
                                it with joy. He eulogises the body with flowery language&mdash;the nose, which is
                                a tube of mucus, is compared to the bud of a champaka flower; the eyes, which are
                                the repositories of discharge, are called "lotus eyes"; the face, with a spittoon
                                of saliva for a mouth, is called a "moon face"; the arms and legs, which are crooked
                                branches of a tree, are claimed to possess lotus hands and feet! The human being
                                looks upon this demeanour as a great victory and exhibits his shamelessness! The
                                Great Lord, however, has granted a wonderful thing called an "intellect", even to
                                this Shimga character of a human being, which He has not given to any other species.
                                The purpose of this gift is to use it to understand the ultimate Truth&mdash;the Self
                               &mdash;and to put and end to this demeaning show. Yet the human being misuses his intellect.
                                He looks upon the gutter as the Ganges and the body as God and he is spoiling it
                                further. This person spends a lot of his time engrossed in adorning his physical
                                body, taking this body as "I", and then when he comes in contact with a female body,
                                he even calls her body his own! He deposits all his sense of "mineness" or possession
                                in that female body. By virtue of the contact of this "I" and "mine", many children
                                are born, and a whole household is brought into existence. The household is shattered
                                at last, and the poor man suffers ridicule&mdash;his story has been described in the
                                book <i>Dasbodh</i> by Samartha Ramdas. It cannot but be recommended that this book
                                should be read thoroughly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The "I" cannot be traced anywhere in the body. It is also a fact, therefore, that
                                the body is not "mine". Then to whom does the body belong? Who is the "owner" of
                                the body?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The five elements [prapancha]&mdash;the earth, water, heat, light and air or space
                               &mdash;have the rightful ownership of this body. After this body falls, each of these
                                elements reclaims their own share from it, and finally the body is destroyed. The
                                body is a bundle of these five elements and each of these element returns back to
                                its rightful owner. The clothes that were tied in the bundle have been taken away
                                by the respective owners, and the cloth in which the bundle was tied up is also
                                taken away by it's owner. How then can a thing called a "bundle" remain? There is
                                nothing left to be seen. In the same way, once the body which is composed of the
                                five elements gets absorbed back into in the five principles of these elements,
                                there remains no object such as the "body" at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, "I" am not in the body, nor does the body belong to me. This type of body
                                cannot sustain the pride of "I" or ego nor can it sustain all the relationships
                                which exist due to the contact of the body, such as birth and death, or the six
                                passions that affect the body. All these cannot thus be related to me as "mine"!
                                The body may be in a state of childhood or youth or old-age, or the body may be
                                dark, fair, beautiful or ugly, it may have been infested with a disease, it may
                                be just wandering aimlessly, or going to holy places for a pilgrimage, or it may
                                be motionless in samadhi&mdash;all these attitudes, conditions, properties or modifications
                                belong only to the body&mdash;but the "I" is quite separate from all these. This at
                                least we have learnt from the analysis of the physical body. Someone else's beautiful,
                                cute, bonnie baby is of no value to us compared to our own dark, stocky boy, who
                                has pock marks and a dirty, running nose. We do not suffer if someone else's sweet
                                child dies, as much as we suffer if our old slipper is lost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The reason for this is that we do not have the same sense of "possession" or "mine"
                                for the other person. Once however, one understands that this particular thing is
                                not "mine", and that it belongs to someone else, one becomes indifferent and gradually
                                even starts despising that "someone else" or "another". And then it is renounced.
                                Body belongs to "another", to the five elements. Once we understand that it is not
                                "mine" and is the property of "someone else", then whatever kind of body it may
                                be, how can it affect us? So come on&mdash;leave this body and let it proceed ahead.
                                Yet, to leave this body does not mean that it should be pushed into a well or be
                                hung with a noose around it's neck. The body, if destroyed on purpose, definitely
                                gets born again and again. This is a reason for rebirth. "Leaving it" means gaining
                                factual knowledge about the body. When it is known as it really is&mdash;belonging
                                to the five elements&mdash;then the abiding interest in it wanes and the body automatically
                                gets renounced. Complete renunciation of the body is achieved only through discriminative
                                thinking, and renunciation liberates a human being from the body altogether.

                                Out of these, everyone knows the constant daily dissolution. This dissolution refers
                                to sleep. In deep sleep, the whole world including our body gets dissolved. After
                                awakening, however, the body and world are present as before and all the actions
                                start as they did before. The dissolution after death is the same as this. After
                                death, in the absence of Self-knowledge, the being has to take another body in accordance
                                with his karma. In the new body, the actions&mdash;like eating, sleeping, getting
                                afraid and mating&mdash;happen according to the impressions gained in previous lives.
                                Brahma pralaya is the dissolution of the creator of the whole universe. Kalpa pralaya
                                is the dissolution that takes place at a certain point in time, in which many creators
                                have come and gone [and has a cycle of 4,32 billion years]. Again, a new kalpa starts
                                and the creation, which was latent for sometime, rises with renewed vigour and activity
                                and starts all over again. In this way, this wheel drawing forth each life, continues
                                to revolve by rising and setting at fixed periods. Bodies therefore cannot be dissolved
                                in these four types of dissolution. But the result of the dissolution by discriminative
                                thinking is very powerful and unique. In this type of dissolution the body not only
                                dissolves itself while living, but after death, when it completely dissolves, it
                                will not allow itself to rise again.

                                Suppose there is a toy snake made of rubber lying about. Till such a time that one
                                does not understand that it is made of rubber, the fear of the snake will remain.
                                As long as the snake is taken for real, one will be shaken with fear. In deep sleep
                                the snake is not there, but upon awakening, it reappears. Getting drunk to forget
                                about the snake will not do because the effect of the drink wears off, and again
                                the snake reappears. Even if the snake is hidden from sight, still the image remains
                                within the mind, and the fear is sustained. This shows that the eradication of the
                                fear of the snake by the above described means is not everlasting. The only remedy
                                to destroy the fear so that it never returns is to know for certain that the snake
                                is only made of rubber. Once this knowledge dawns, even if the eyes see the snake
                                again, there is no cause for fear. In the same way, when one correctly knows what
                                this body is, even if the body is alive, the pride of the body being "mine" vanishes
                                and automatically the body is renounced. This is what is called the "dissolution
                                by thought". One who dies with certainty of thought is free from the cycle of birth
                                and death. However, one who dies thoughtlessly, it should be taken for granted that
                                he died in order to take birth all over again!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, by virtue of dissolution through thought, the thing is seen as if it is immaterial.
                                With the other four types of dissolution, whether the thing is there in front of
                                you or is hidden out of sight, it is still seen as if it is existing there! Samartha
                                Ramdas therefore asserts that it is only thought that fulfils a human being by making
                                him complete. The "I" could not be gleaned even when the physical body was passed
                                through the sieve of the procedure of dissolution by thought.

                                Subtle Body</h4>
                            <p>
                                Now we will use the same sieve of dissolution by thought to try and trace the "I"
                                in the subtle body and see if this thief called "I" is found anywhere. Let us first
                                find out what the subtle body is. This body is comprised of a higher committee of
                                seventeen members&mdash;the five senses used for action, the five used for gaining
                                knowledge, the five pranas, and the mind and intellect. Whatever orders this committee
                                promulgates are carried out by the working members of the working committee, which
                                is the gross body. The subtle body's field of authority is very vast, so it might
                                be possible to spot that "I" here, for he has a strong passion for authority. But
                                the moment we start our search here, that "I" has already put his stamp of "mine"
                                here. Whatever is found here is also called "my" senses, "my" pranas, "my" mind,
                                and "my" intellect. But no sound like "I am the intellect" is ever heard here. That
                                "I" parades about as the "owner" of all these members. But the "I" himself is not
                                seen or found here at all. Thus, according to the axiom, "There can be nothing which
                                I can call "mine" where "I" am not present", it is clear that the seventeen members
                                of the subtle body cannot be "me" or "mine" at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One could object to this axiom by asking, "King George the Vth is not present in
                                Sholapur [city in Maharashtra], but does it mean that Sholapur is not under his
                                ownership?" The answer is, "At least there is an individual called George the Vth,
                                and even if he is living somewhere else, his ownership can exist in some other place
                                even if he is not present there." This "I", however, is a nonentity and yet, like
                                Gomaji Ganesh of the city of Andheri&mdash;the empire of ignorance&mdash;he claims that
                                he is the authority here. Thus the "I" is evidently non-existent here, as it cannot
                                be traced, so then how can the sense of "mineness" sustain itself in the subtle
                                body as well?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The subtle body is like a subtle silken bundle of five principles, even if it more
                                difficult to untie the silken knot by thought, still it becomes incumbent upon us
                                to untie it with effort. Once the bundle is untied and left open, this body gets
                                automatically renounced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The seed of birth and death is this subtle body, which is of the nature of desire.
                                If that seed is roasted in the fire of Self-knowledge just once, it may appear unchanged,
                                but there is no hope of it sprouting if it is ever sown.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A doubt may arise here that if both these gross and subtle bodies are renounced,
                                and the attitude of pride&mdash;such as "I" and and "mine"&mdash;has also disappeared,
                                then the actions of that body may either come to a halt, or they might not be executed
                                efficiently. The doubt may be removed by the following example. Suppose a man keeps
                                a thing in a locker, as he is of the impression that it is made of gold. But if
                                he discovers later on that it is only made of brass, he may either leave it in the
                                locker or remove it and keep it outside. His attachment towards that thing may either
                                vanish or become much less. This is a fact. In the same way, if the pride of possession
                                of the body as "my own" gradually gets ignored, nothing much will be lost. If an
                                aspirant reaches this level of conviction, then the attitude&mdash;"Having experienced
                                the ecstasy of Brahmananda, one's own being, who cares for the body?"&mdash;arises
                                in him. This is really praiseworthy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A dog once bit off a piece of flesh from Kabir's calf muscle, and Kabir, who was
                                a great devotee, simply said, "Either the dog knows or the flesh knows that anything
                                is possible!" On hearing these words from Kabir, what could have been the feeling
                                of the people standing nearby? To what degree of renunciation Kabir must have 
                                reached&mdash;the aspirant could well imagine! But even if this happened to Kabir or to Tukaram
                                when he lost his whole household, you might not get the ecstasy within yourselves,
                                yet if with God's Grace such an ecstasy overwhelms you, you might say, "What is
                                this worth after all?", and you will never ask such pointless questions as, "Will
                                my house run properly?" You will have developed such an indifferent attitude as
                                to say, "Let whatever that has to happen, happen and let whatever has to go, go."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, if the aspirant understands intellectually, which is easier than experiencing
                                the Self, he may raise the question, "After the knowledge of the Self is attained
                                and the possessive pride of the body and mind has vanished, could worldly duties
                                still be performed?" The Satguru, to console him answers, "Dear one, even after
                                realising the utter uselessness of the body and mind, one can still establish a
                                household and have children without bringing in the pride of the body and the mind.
                                These both can be looked after very well. All the relevant duties one did earlier
                                can still be diligently performed." How? Just see! Look at the behaviour of a hired
                                nurse of an infant. She nurses the child, takes him around, consoles him if he cries,
                                nurses him back to health if he gets sick, just exactly as if she were his mother.
                                If she likes the child, she even kisses it lovingly. But while doing all this work,
                                she does not even have the feeling that the child is not her own. In spite of all
                                she does for the child, if the father of the child dismisses her, she at once packs
                                up her things and leaves the house. At the moment she leaves, she is neither happy
                                if the child has put on weight nor is she sad if the child were to die of some disease.
                                The reason for this type of behaviour is that she has no sense of "mineness" for
                                the child, but it cannot be said that due to the absence of this "mineness", she
                                had not discharged her duty properly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let us take another example. Take the case of a trustee who manages a minor's estate
                                worth several hundred thousand rupees. His sense of "I" or "mine" does not obstruct
                                his duty, yet the trustee has been managing the estate of the ward very efficiently.
                                If the duty is not discharged properly, the trustee becomes liable for punishment.
                                The trustee does not get affected if the estate increases in value, or if it is
                                decided in a legal suit that the estate does not belong to the minor, but to someone
                                else. His duty is only to manage the estate carefully, so long as it is under his
                                management.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In short, in order that the duties be discharged properly, it is not necessary that
                                one has the sense of ego, of "I" or "mine", while performing the duties. Exactly
                                in the same way, the gross and subtle bodies form a bundle that belong to the five
                                elements and are given as a "keepsake" and a "trust" to a human being. As a trustee,
                                you must look after the bundle in the best possible way. If you shirk the responsibility,
                                you will suffer the punishment in the form of loss of health of both the mind and
                                the body. If the trustee manages the minor's estate efficiently and the nurse looks
                                after the child very well, they both get their salaries in return. If you look after
                                your body and mind well and keep them in a healthy condition, you also receive joy
                                in return. To attain absolute Reality [Paramartha], a healthy body is useful. All
                                this however, has to be achieved without the sense of "mine". With this attitude,
                                even if the body becomes nourished and fat, thin, or it lives or dies, there is
                                no elation or lament.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the trustee of a minor's estate establishes "mineness" or ownership of the estate
                                and embezzles it, this will come to light and he will either have to commit suicide
                                or go to jail. In this case, identification with the body means forgetting the Self
                                or killing the Self. Getting bound to the idea of body being the Self, the hope
                                of liberation will recede.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From the above discussion, you might have understood that the usual obligations
                                and actions of the body and mind should be fulfilled in a proper way and it is not
                                necessary to establish "ownership" or "mineness" over both. The obligations of the
                                trustee and the nurse, while acting such, have no sense of possession, and are carried
                                out quite normally. In the same manner, the duties of a human being can be performed
                                without entertaining the sense of "possession" or "mineness".

                                Suppose we lose the sense of possession in both the gross and subtle bodies, and
                                we admit the fact that the bundle belongs to a stranger, but we still have to find
                                out the answer to the question, "Who am I?", or "Where am I?" Now then, let us go
                                to the causal body. But what is this? As soon as we step in here, there is just
                                pitch darkness everywhere! Is it possible that this ignorance is the city of residence
                                of this "I"? It seems this is his main headquarters. This seems to be the main capital
                                that belongs to him. There is certainly a hope of finding that "I" here. Let us
                                at least try and see. But if we move about like the blindfolded, sensing for it,
                                that "I" is not found anywhere here either. Here "I" seems to have given up his
                                sense of "mine". There seems to be nothing which can be called "mine" in this place.
                                Everything seems to be absolutely quiet. That "I" who harshly cries aloud "I", "I",
                                in both the gross and subtle bodies, seems to be totally silent here. He seems to
                                be playing hide and seek, so that he may not be caught by one who is in search of
                                "I". The "I" seems to have dug a trench here, so that the one seeking him may fall
                                into it and abandon his search.

                                Dear aspirants, do not be afraid. The Satguru is standing behind you as well as
                                in front of you and he will take you safely across the trenches of darkness. Many
                                scholars and learned persons have turned their backs in fear at this very point
                                and have abandoned their quest for Truth. For you however, there is no reason to
                                be afraid like them. You have a guide here who is Samartha Satguru, a very capable
                                master.
                            </p>

                                After getting stabilised in this darkness, and planting the feet firmly there for
                                a long time, a voice is heard softly saying, "I am the witness of this ignorance."
                                All of a sudden there springs some courage uttering the hope of catching the thief.
                                It becomes stronger with the thought, "Oh! This thief is somewhere nearby witnessing
                                the ignorance." Here, one must watch persistently, and how it is done will be discussed
                                in the next lesson. That witnessing he is doing from beyond the trench of the causal
                                body, taking a position in the supra-causal body [Mahakarana or Turiya]. This is
                                understood quickly, and then "I" is so overjoyed at having found himself! Who can
                                describe that joy? In that joy, "I" cries out "Prajnanam Brahma"<b> </b>["Knowing
                                absolute Reality is the Supreme knowledge"] as well as, "Aham Brahmasmi" ["I am
                                absolute Reality"].
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This one who says "I" "I", is really the all-witnessing Brahman, the unique Reality
                                with the nature of the pure knowledge "I am". When the certitude is established,
                                there arises wave after wave of bliss. When the bliss ebbs away, look at the miracle
                                that happened! After deep thought, I started feeling that I am not even of the nature
                                of knowledge, as I am covered with ignorance, in the same way I am covered with
                                knowledge&mdash;not that I was born with ignorance or knowledge. Ignorance and knowledge
                                came after "I" became "I" and this sequence seems to point towards me as their creator.
                                Therefore, this knowledge is my child and "I" am his father, and "I" as father am
                                someone different from that knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When this series of thought dawned within me, the "Aham Brahmasmi" in the Supra-causal
                                body, a body also started ebbing out and even that got fully eradicated. Then I
                                was suddenly naked, of course. Now it cannot be described who that "I" is and how
                                that "I" is! If you want the description of the "I" who is found here, then you
                                may utter any word found in any dictionary. I will have to express it as, "It is
                                not this, not this", but the One who throws light on this. Again you utter words
                                and sentences, and whatever meaning comes forth, take it as the description of "I".
                                And if you do not understand, leave the words aside and just merge in deep silence
                                and see who "I am".
