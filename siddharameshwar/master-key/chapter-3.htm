                            <p>
                                During the search of "I", we turned all the four bodies inside out, but we could
                                not trace it here. It is true that "I" went away without words beyond all the four
                                bodies, where there is not even an idea of "I" or "you". However, it will not do
                                to just keep the mouth shut and go into deep silence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this exposition which is done so far, the gross, subtle, causal and Supra-causal
                                bodies have been described superficially, and it is necessary to examine all the
                                aspects of these four in detail. More so, unless these are understood very properly,
                                and unless that understanding is made a part of one's nature, an aspirant will not
                                be able to achieve deep silence. We will therefore examine in detail the aspects
                                of these four bodies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here it is necessary to remember that these four bodies are the four steps leading
                                to the fifth and final rung of still silence, where words become silent. If one
                                goes step by step, one can surely reach the end of the journey, but if one step
                                is skipped by putting one's foot on the following step, there is a greater possibility
                                of losing balance and falling back. Thus when one body is fully understood, only
                                then should the aspirant see what is in the next body. Without doing this, if one
                                starts stepping on the steps hastily, there will be a lot of chaos. In all this
                                chaos, then, as the state of conditioning is the same in ignorance as it is in samadhi,
                                the actual difference will be lost, and the aspirant might mistake sleep for samadhi
                                and ignorance for knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A toy top, when it is steady and when it appears to be steady due to intense speed,
                                is similar to total darkness and the blackout caused by intense light. Thus, although
                                these appear similar from outside, there is a vast difference between the two states.
                                Their unity is also different. If therefore one goes, step by step, there will be
                                no chaos.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Herein it will also be prudent to bring up one more subject to the notion of the
                                aspirant. That subject is to convince the aspirant about the fact that there is
                                no basis for any doubts that arise in the aspirant regarding the contradictions
                                in the method adopted for the exposition of a point in the scriptures&mdash;we will
                                therefore first examine the method adopted in the scriptures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When a subject is to be explained to an aspirant, first a description of it is given
                                to show its great importance, and then it is said that a great reward will ensue
                                if it is understood. Once the aspirant understands the subject completely, before
                                explaining the next subject, the method is first to bring home to the aspirant the
                                futility of the subject that is already understood. Only after that, the great importance
                                of the subject to be taught next is brought home to him. The reason for this method
                                is that there is no tendency at all to turn to a subject unless its importance is
                                brought out first, and also unless a reward is held out as a temptation. In the
                                same way, the futility of a subject is brought home, and then the subject gets automatically
                                renounced and the aspirant becomes eager to know the next subject.

								Gross Body
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The <i>Vedas</i>, taking into consideration the psychological background of an aspirant,
                                first inspire him to work for food, telling him that food is Reality. Then they
                                give him some time to fondle the gross body, telling him that the gross body itself
                                is Reality. Whatever experience of joy may come to the gross body is actually enjoyed
                                by the subtle body. The gross body is merely a corpse, and a corpse can in no way
                                enjoy anything if it does not contain the subtle body. Thus, the futility of the
                                gross body is shown.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next, they tell him that the mind, intellect, senses, and the sheath that is made
                                up of pranas [vital breath] are Reality. Thus, it is bigger. The <i>Vedas</i> thus
                                give importance to the subtle body. After that comes the causal body, which is steady
                                and even bigger. It swallows the subtle body. So the causal body is now eulogised
                                as Reality and advice is given to the aspirant&mdash;"You yourself have become the
                                causal body." However, since this body is considered to be in ignorance and total
                                darkness, this claim could not be made here. The aspirant is therefore compelled
                                to search further in the Supra-causal body, from where the voice saying "I am the
                                witness" emanated. After this, the Supra-causal body of Self-knowledge is studied
                                thoroughly. The <i>Vedas</i>, after having rejected each body, assert that That
                                which remains is Reality. When they were confronted with the problem of explaining
                                the steady Reality, they started professing ignorance and repeated the sentence,
                                "Not this, not this!" That which is neither touched by ignorance nor knowledge is
                                Reality. In such a negative way, the <i>Vedas</i> describe Reality as "That which
                                is beyond all the four bodies."
                            </p>
                            <div class="right-image-div">
                                <img src="images/siddharameshwar-cigarette.jpg" />

                            <p>
                                Its principle is as follows&mdash;when it said that one is bigger than the other,
                                it does not mean that the one is more superior than the other. In comparison with
                                the needle, the needle used for stitching jute bags is big, but it cannot be bigger
                                than the iron rod used for digging. Therefore, the qualities like "big" and "small"
                                are not inherent in a thing, but are imposed upon a thing by relating it or comparing
                                it with another thing. The same rule applies here. After enunciating in 
                                sequence&mdash;food as Reality, gross body as Reality, subtle body as Reality, causal body
                                as Reality, and finally the Supra-causal body as Reality [the latter being greater
                                than the others]&mdash;the intention is to give this instruction and enunciate the
                                principle that out of all these, there is none which can be said to be Reality.
                                Though the latter state is relatively higher than the previous one, yet it is still
                                not Reality, which is absolutely unique.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When remembering the above mentioned method of exposition, it is necessary to clearly
                                understand what Reality could be described as being. Why should Reality be described
                                at all? How far can one go to describe It as such? And why first describe It and
                                then negate that description in the same breath? It is very necessary to understand
                                all this correctly. To a person who is not a proper cook, the instruction is given
                                to him as to how to cook rice&mdash;"Light fire below the cooking pot." After some
                                time, an instruction is given again to the same person&mdash;"Now put out the fire."
                                The person may wonder about the contradictory instructions, but his Guru explains
                                to him, "Dear one, it is necessary to keep the fire under the cooking pot until
                                the rice is cooked, and after it is cooked, the fire must be put out otherwise you
                                will have to eat burned rice."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is the reason why any method that is practised, must be practised only until
                                you reach the goal, otherwise if you don't stop at the end, it will only bring exhaustion
                                and may even bring you nothing at all! Thus, when the subtle body is called "Reality",
                                once it is understood wherein lies the merit of the subtle body, it loses its value
                                as Reality and it becomes necessary for the aspirant to search for the next thing.
                                It means therefore, that when we offer a price to something to achieve results,
                                it may be that the price may not reflect the exact value of the thing. "If an occasion
                                arises, you will have to address even a donkey as "uncle"." In this example, honour
                                is given to the donkey due to some calamity that has befallen you. 
                                 </p>
                            <p>
                                In the same way,
                                a human being is facing a great calamity due to the fact that he has forgotten his
                                real nature. It is therefore necessary to liberate oneself from the calamity or
                                obstruction in which he is caught. If you are caught by a crocodile, and if you
                                could get out of its grip by flattering it, telling the crocodile that her back
                                is very smooth and soft, does it really mean that her back is as soft as a feather
                                mattress? This question should be asked to the man who thus gets released from the
                                crocodile. Similarly, to get out of the grip of the four bodies, they are called
                                "Reality" for some time until the true understanding of Reality dawns on the aspirant.
                                Remembering this method of exposition, we will now turn our attention to the description
                                of all the four bodies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The nature of the gross body is quite well known. It is a mass of flesh and blood
                                and can be touched by the hand, so all are quite familiar with it. Not only this,
                                everyone uses it fully. The gross body is "I", and therefore, all the passions and
                                desires that arise in the body are "mine". The dark or fair complexion of the body
                                and the stages of childhood, youth or old age belong to "me". The relationships
                                that are created through the body, caste, religion, cult, house, the land and wealth
                                are all "mine". Every human being has learned this lesson so very well by taking
                                many births. In fact, it is so well-learned that while dreaming he would tell you
                                that he is such-and-such a "Gomaji". It is therefore unnecessary to teach the lesson
                                again and again because it is already firmly implanted in his psyche. The feet of
                                all the human beings are resting steadily on the step of this gross body. The stage
                                of this gross body is of "awakeness" and in this body there is partial forgetfulness
                                and partial remembrance. This body is therefore predominated by activity and passion,
                                and this explanation is enough to understand the gross body. Now we will turn to
                                the next step of the subtle body.

								Subtle Body
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The subtle body is a committee of the senses, the mind, the intellect, the vital
                                breath [pranas] and the instruments of inner perception [antahkarana] which creates
                                a pseudo-mental world when the seen world becomes visible after closing the eyes.
                                After some thought, it comes to our attention that the subtle body is really a different
                                and peculiar thing. All the movements of the gross body are in accordance to the
                                dictates of this subtle body. Volition [sankalpa] means something is like this and
                                doubt [vikalpa] means something is not like this. This subtle body is such that
                                it projects a perverse type of knowledge of contradictory thoughts; and its state
                                is the stage of dreaming. Continuous memory is the indicative quality of this body
                                and preservation [sattvaguna] predominates here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the aspirant is introduced to the subtle body in this way, he would himself
                                become that body. When one foot is implanted firmly on the next step, the other
                                foot can be lifted up and placed next to it, completely leaving the previous step.
                                When one crosses the boundaries of a village and puts his foot in the limits of
                                the neighbouring village, the first village is left behind and one becomes a traveller
                                and explorer of the neighbouring village. In the same way, to properly understand
                                the above described step of the subtle body, once he plants his foot firmly on this
                                step, the aspirant has to lift his foot from the gross body in order to bring it
                                into practice. The gross body is left behind and he has to sever all the connections
                                with it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This work is not as easy as it seems, for crossing over all these steps every human
                                being only has two legs. One leg is the leg of "learning" and the other leg is that
                                of "bringing into practice what which has been learned". Removing both feet from
                                the step of the gross body and planting them on the subtle body means transgressing
                                the physical body. When one leaves aside all sense of pride and possession of the
                                small gross body and takes pride of possession in the subtle body by saying "I am
                                only the subtle body", it means that the gross body is renounced and the subtle
                                body is accepted as "I". When the aspirant arrives on this second step, then the
                                lower self, made up of the gross body, is seen and perceived as "not "I"". Now "I"
                                has no relationship with this gross body. The changes that happen to this gross
                                body or its qualities&mdash;as it's dark or fair complexion is not "mine"&mdash;means
                                that the chief string pullers are now of the subtle body, which are mind, intellect,
                                vital breath, senses and "I am". But are they endowed with such qualities as fat,
                                dark, old, etc...? "I am only the mind and the intellect." If the aspirant studies
                                this assiduously, then both his feet get firmly planted on the second step, and
                                he loses pride and the sense of possession of the gross body. He then becomes indifferent
                                to all conditioning of the gross body.

                               Causal Body &mdash; Forgetfulness
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The third step, beyond the gross and subtle bodies, is the causal body of ignorance
                                or "not-knowing". It is only a state of pure forgetfulness, of the quality of darkness,
                                where there is no thought of well-being nor of the gross and subtle bodies! The
                                state in which there is no knowledge of anything is the causal body. It is like
                                sleep, but it is not sleep. It is very important to understand this state. Those
                                who enunciate the principle of zero&mdash;where there is nothing, only a void &mdash;
                                came to this state and turned back, as they say there is nothing ahead. This point
                                is the state of the "unknowable", from the point of view of Western philosophy.
                                This state being bereft of all thoughts, fancies and doubts is taken as transcendental
                                awareness [samadhi] in the form of Self-absorption [nirvikalpa Brahman], and as
                                soon as this void is reached, one is apt to get false satisfaction by saying, "Today
                                I saw Brahman."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When one modification of the mind is stabilised, and another fresh one has not yet
                                risen, the interval or pause between these two&mdash;the intervening pause period
                                before sleep sets in and the waking state disappears&mdash;is a state of pure forgetfulness.
                                This state of forgetfulness is described in the scriptures as the "borderline of
                                the Self" or the "sheath of bliss" [anandamaya kosha]. All the chaos, struggle,
                                infinite number of waves of thought have ceased in this causal body, and therefore
                                there is peace in this third body in comparison with the other two bodies. It is
                                true that the aspirant experiences joy here, but this is neither ultimate peace
                                nor real bliss. One must remember this well! The natural state of all the gods,
                                demons and every human being is in this state, which is the causal body in the form
                                of forgetfulness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The chief indication of this body is to forget everything. Unless one forgets, one
                                cannot have deep sleep. To say, "I was asleep, but I remembered something", is to
                                say "I never slept." Having deep sleep therefore means not remembering a single
                                thing. In the same way, to sleep while being in the waking state means one enters
                                the causal body, which is the natural state of all human beings. Not knowing anything
                                means you have entered this state. Even big scholars do not understand the true
                                nature of a human being, let alone the true nature of Shiva. In order to explain
                                that state of human forgetfulness, the way of studying the pause is shown. If anything
                                is difficult, it is to completely stabilise in this state of forgetfulness and to
                                know it thoroughly. With great effort, an aspirant should try to achieve this. They
                                [the scriptures] have particularly laid stress upon this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fact is that during the pause between two states, there is nothing but pure
                                consciousness. The state of muni [the silent man] is such that he does not allow
                                a single word to rise, or even if it does rise, he does not allow its meaning to
                                rise. He just lets it slip by. When the word rises and is allowed to impress its
                                meaning on the mind, the world is born. Rejecting the word by not allowing it to
                                carry any meaning to the mind is the eradication of the world. When the word does
                                not energise the mind, then whatever is left is the pure energy of consciousness.
                                To experience this state continuously is what is called the "state of still silence".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The aspirant who is about to put his foot on the third step after climbing the first
                                and second, although he is told that this is the state of pure consciousness, still
                                gets the impression that this state is pure void. By taking the void to be Final
                                Reality, he is unable to witness the void. However, if he goes to the fourth step
                                from the third, and he looks back at the third step, he will not be able to see
                                anything at all, and he will wonder, "How is it that my Guru instructed me to put
                                my foot on a step which does not exist at all!?" The reason is that once pure consciousness
                                is known, there can be no trace of what is called "ignorance". One does not understand
                                what the state of forgetfulness is, and there does not arise any modification in
                                the aspirant's mind except that of pure consciousness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Consciousness or knowledge presents itself to the aspirant in two ways&mdash;the first
                                is when there is an object in consciousness, then it becomes "objective knowledge"
                                and he will experience it as objective knowledge. The second is when there is no
                                object and this will be experienced as pure consciousness. When there is an object,
                                it will be objective knowledge and when there is no object, it is simply pure knowledge,
                                or consciousness. Except for these two, there arises no other modification in the
                                aspirant's mind. The word "ignorance" is meaningless from the point of view of the
                                aspirant. It is not possible for forgetfulness to exist in this case. Whatever is,
                                will be either knowledge or consciousness. It may be objective or it may be non-objective,
                                but it is all still pure consciousness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Putting before him the state of the causal body and telling him it is just ignorance,
                                a void, a state of forgetfulness where nothing can exist, helps the aspirant to
                                realise that it is all just pure consciousness. In order to help a student understand
                                that a tiny dot has no width nor length, the school teacher draws a large dot of
                                great length and breadth on the blackboard. That is how it is here too. If it is
                                not done in this manner, the next step cannot be explained, so who can help it?
                                The aspirant should therefore keep full faith in the Satguru without further argument,
                                taking for granted that there is a state of forgetfulness, and should go on practising
                                it to learn to forget each and everything. He will understand that the causal body
                                is the cause of the previous two bodies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is a side curtain on a theatre stage called the "wing" from which actors emerge
                                and into which they again disappear. The natural state of a human being is like
                                this wing on the stage&mdash;the state of forgetfulness. From behind the curtain emerge
                                all memories, and they disappear again behind the same curtain. When we say we have
                                forgotten a thing before remembering it, it means that the thing was abiding in
                                that state of forgetfulness, and it proves that it emerged from that state alone.
                                As opposed to this, when we say that we forgot a certain thing, then it means that
                                the thing that was in the memory has disappeared behind the curtain of forgetfulness.
                                A memory before it is forgotten returns to forgetfulness after it is remembered.
                                The rising and setting of all ideas are in the womb of the one "forgetfulness" and
                                therefore this state is the common ground for all human beings. By reason of forgetfulness,
                                each human being says he is ignorant and struggles to get at least some kind of
                                knowledge. During this struggle, a majority of those unfortunate ones gain worldly
                                knowledge and completely miss out on gaining true knowledge of their own nature.

                            <p>
                                That is why, while introducing the causal body described above, the Satguru tells
                                the disciple, "Dear one, you are not the gross physical body and you are not the
                                subtle body, so you better identify yourself with the causal body." The aspirant
                                must attain this state of forgetfulness, and he will come to realise that, "I am
                                definitely not the gross body and not even the subtle body, therefore all the dreams
                                and doubts that arise from both these bodies, do not abide in me. I am complete
                                forgetfulness, bereft of all ideas. The birth and death of the body, the misery,
                                temptations, pain, pleasure, hunger and thirst&mdash;none of these can ever touch
                                me. Honour and dishonour exist only in the mind, and a fair or dark complexion belongs
                                only to the body&mdash;I am totally detached from these qualities associated with
                                the gross and subtle bodies. Nothing can attach itself to me. I am mere forgetfulness."
                                Revising this lesson again and again and thus making it firmly established in the
                                heart, the state of forgetfulness without any idea or attachment, thus becomes one's
                                own nature. When this kind of mental practice is firmly established, then the aspirant
                                definitely rises to the third step and becomes steady. Only then can it be said
                                that he has now become worthy of putting his foot on the next and final step of
                                the Supra-causal body.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before going to the next step, it is necessary to mention the fact that the causal
                                body, although like sleep, is a state distinct from sleep. Furthermore, it is explained
                                that in deep sleep all the senses are in complete repose, therefore no objects exist
                                there. In such a state, each being enjoys the bliss which radiates from his own
                                true nature, but he does not still know who he really is. On waking up from deep
                                sleep, each being describes his own experience in the following manner&mdash;"I slept
                                happily and I did not know anything." In this way, he conveys the bliss of his own
                                nature as well as his own ignorance about it. He unknowingly conveys his knowingness
                                of his own ignorance, and thus proves his knowingness, but he does not know his
                                own Self. An heir to a treasure of buried gold coins&mdash;in the absence of the knowledge
                                of such treasure&mdash;goes about his day begging to make his livelihood. For him,
                                that treasure is as good as not being there at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, each human being, going back and coming out of his own nature, dives deep
                                within it and experiences profound bliss, but his deep ignorance about his own Self
                                abides there permanently. It is for this reason that deep sleep cannot be the means
                                of attaining knowledge of the Self, one's own true nature. In deep sleep, the aspirant
                                has no scope at all to study the state, but this is not the case in the matter of
                                forgetfulness. To study forgetfulness means to enjoy the deep sleep state while
                                being fully awake. How to enjoy this wakeful deep sleep is taught by the Satguru.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                How does a fish go to sleep while living in water? This you will only understand
                                when you take birth in that species. How can the sleep of a fish not get disturbed
                                by the water entering it's eyes? This secret cannot be known unless one is born
                                as a fish. Thus, how can one enjoy deep sleep while remaining fully awake? One will
                                understand this only by becoming a true son of the Satguru.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fogetfulness is nothing but deep sleep, yet what is described above is the silence
                                within, which is created knowingly during the stage of wakefulness. It is not deep
                                sleep which comes knowingly, because in deep sleep nothing is known. But in forgetfulness,
                                which is knowingly brought about, the nature of the Self is known. This is the difference
                                between deep sleep and samadhi.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though it is known that forgetfulness is nothing other than forgetfulness, and nothing
                                is known in that state, the fact is that after everything is forgotten, some knowledge
                                still remains. This can be understood only through the study of forgetfulness. This
                                state is absolutely true. Deep sleep and forgetfulness are both the results of tamoguna,
                                a form of ignorance that lulls the spiritual being away from his true nature. For
                                example, if an analysis of a piece of coal and a diamond is made, it is found that
                                there is nothing but carbon in both&mdash;which means that both are only two forms
                                of carbon. But even if it is true, it is not necessary to say that there is a vast
                                difference in their respective value. When the ingredient of carbon is the same
                                in both, how is it that the diamond shines whereas the coal is black and lustreless?
                                The reason is that the proportion of carbon is different in both. Likewise, deep
                                sleep and forgetfulness share different proportions of ignorance and that is why
                                in deep sleep the immense density of ignorance is felt, whereas, in forgetfulness
                                the rarity of ignorance is realised. As the depth of sleep decreases, the onset
                                of wakefulness rises. The man who has woken up from deep sleep is first slightly
                                under the fuzzy influence of sleep, and then he awakens slowly. This state is the
                                result of the decrease in the depth of sleep until the stark state of full awakeness
                                emerges. Deep sleep is like a pitch black curtain covering the lamp of Self, and
                                the causal body, which is the state of forgetfulness under study, is like a thin
                                transparent velvet curtain. This means that in both these states the enjoyment of
                                bliss is the same. Yet from the point of view of achieving the knowledge of one's
                                own Self, deep sleep is useless. It is like having sexual intercourse with a barren
                                woman while hoping for a child. The study of the anandamaya kosha in the form of
                                the state of forgetfulness affords joy, and is a precursor of reaching the goal
                                of knowing one's own Self.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After having said all this, we will now observe the Supra-causal body which is endowed
                                with the knowledge that comes after the study of forgetfulness. Let us digress a
                                little here. Those aspirants who have taken the traditional mantra according to
                                Bhausaheb Maharaj's [the Guru of Siddharameshwar Maharaj] cult, may have a doubt
                                in their mind at this point. It is here that the study of the causal body helps
                                you to forget everything. If this is so, does it mean that the repeating of the
                                incantation given by the Guru and the colour or forms that stand before the half
                                closed eyes should also be forgotten? The answer is "Yes, you have to even forget
                                this." Before doing it, while only reciting the mantra and the colour or whichever
                                form would be present, the aspirant must decide for himself that the rest of the
                                noise and the mental prattle have ceased and died out completely. After concentrating
                                on the tip of the nose with half closed eyes, no other words or forms should arise
                                apart from the incantation and the present colour forms. Once this is done, it is
                                true that even that has to be forgotten. The broom taken in the hand to sweep up
                                all the rubbish in the house should not be kept in the hand after the rubbish has
                                been removed from each corner of the house. That also has to be thrown out. The
                                Satguru imparts the mantra to the aspirant as a discipline. He has thus given the
                                tool in the form of the mantra&mdash;to sweep up and clean up all rubbish in the form
                                of doubts, worries and dreams accumulated in our bodies and minds over an infinite
                                number of births. How far that tool should be preserved in the heart and when should
                                it be left alone has been clearly explained above. Now we will see that this Supra-causal
                                body is like the father of all the other bodies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Indian mythology, King Janaka was a videhi, one without a body [which means living
                                in the world, but not being of the world]. He had a daughter named Janaki [which
                                also means "knowingness"]. In this story, King Janaka is the same as the Supra-causal
                                body. There is a state of consciousness which is "bodilessness" in spite of the
                                fact that the body still exists, and that is the state of knowledge in the Supra-causal
                                body. In comparison with the last three bodies, though it is called the "Supra-causal
                                body", it is still a state of "bodilessness" only because it has no conditions.
                                The Supra-causal body is in the form of knowledge. This does not mean there is an
                                absence of knowledge in the former three bodies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Knowledge is the same, whether it is in a disturbed condition or in equanimity.
                                Knowledge is as clean and pure in the state of equanimity as it is in a disturbed
                                case, or even when immersed in the slush of objective knowledge. In all the states,
                                knowledge is one and of the same kind. But the knowledge in the three bodies other
                                than the Supra-causal body is taken as adulterated knowledge or conditional objective
                                knowledge. The state in the Supra-causal body is balanced or equanimous [with regard
                                to the gunas] and it can be experienced as pure knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whether knowledge is in a equanimous or unbalanced state, knowledge is always pure
                                knowledge. However, it is different with regard to the conditioning, or because
                                of its identity with conditioning, a human being who is inexperienced finds difference
                                and separateness even in pure knowledge itself. Sweetness in a laddoo, jalebi or
                                basundi [Indian sweets] comes only from sugar, but because it is in the form of
                                that object, we say that "the laddoo, jilebi or basundi is sweet." If we do not
                                mix sugar with any other ingredient, we will still have to say that, "sugar is sweet."
                                If a man has to be given an idea of what sugar is like, and if he is given just
                                laddoos to eat and has been told that the sweetness in a laddoo is sugar, he will
                                never get the knowledge of the true nature of sugar. However, if he is shown pure
                                sugar, without mixing it with any other ingredient, then of course he will know
                                exactly what sugar is like.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That is why knowledge cannot be experienced in it's primal state, because in all
                                other states it is always conditioned, what is more it will be explicit only as
                                objective knowledge. But in the Supra-causal body, knowledge which is unapparent
                                or impure in the other three bodies rises to shine in it's pure nature. That is
                                exactly the reason why the aspirant has to be taken to the Supra-causal body. Once
                                the pure knowledge is known, which is knowledge of the Self, then even if it is
                                mixed up with any other type of objective knowledge or is in any other state, it
                                will still be correctly known, and never again will there appear to be a separate
                                identity called the "world".
                            </p>

                                Even when each state comes and goes, the witness of each state has not gone anywhere
                                or come from anywhere. The one who has seen dark and fair complexions, childhood,
                                youth and old age of the physical body, has himself kept an account of all dreams
                                and doubts in the subtly body. The same witness has also seen the causal body, where
                                there is complete absence of dreams and doubts. This One who has witnessed these
                                bodies is forever awake.

                                One woman had a peculiar characteristic&mdash;when she gave birth to a child, the
                                child died before it knew it's mother, and it never saw the faces of it's brothers
                                and sisters because they were already all dead. This woman, in this way, gave birth
                                to a number of children and they all died shortly after birth. However, after burying
                                all the children in the ground, this woman remained where she was. Not one child
                                had seen the face of another child, still the woman had seen the faces of all the
                                children. Exactly like this, the four bodies were born of the Supra-causal body
                                in the form of the great illusion [mahamaya]. Yet these bodies never had the chance
                                of seeing the faces of other bodies, or even of their mother.
                            </p>

                                Even when one state does penetrate into the other, still the pure knowledge travelling
                                within all these states is never adulterated. The thread supports all the beads
                                equally, even through one bead does not penetrate into the other. The Supra-causal
                                body is exactly like this and it pervades all the three states of sleeping, dreaming
                                and awakeness. The pure state of "knowingness" in the Supra-causal body is the Self,
                                the lit flame which makes itself bare after making ignorance forget itself. Once
                                the nature of the witnessing knowledge is known, the state of ignorance vanishes
                                completely. Though this is true, it is not true that the appearance of the seen
                                manifest "world" also vanishes. It is only the attitude of the aspirant that changes.
                                By virtue of intense study, he will experience all that is seen and appears as only
                                knowledge.

                                When one sees only the gold in a piece of jewellery, the piece is not destroyed.
                                In the same way, even though the Lord of the universe [Janardana] is known, the
                                universe is not destroyed. When the light from a lamp destroys the darkness, the
                                objects which have come to light do not vanish. First there was no light, so nothing
                                was known beyond the fact that there were some forms of objects. The nature of the
                                same objects is clearly known in the light. In the same way, while we are looking
                                at and feeling the world with blind eyes in the darkness of ignorance, the Satguru's
                                advice brings vision to our sight. When the flame of knowledge is lit up in the
                                heart, it spreads light all around and the darkness is destroyed, yet the world
                                stays on as it is while it's true nature is laid bare. Thus, the point of view through
                                which one was looking at the world does of course change after one acquires true
                                knowledge.

                                The sight of a mirage is different in each case that follows&mdash;from the point
                                of view of the sun, that of a man, and that of a deer. The object is the same, but
                                the point of view or the act of seeing is different in each case. When rocks get
                                heated by the sun's rays, the waves of steam that rise upon the rocks appear to
                                someone who is standing at a distance as a stream of water. This appearance is termed
                                as a "mirage". The reason why a mirage is called "mrugjala" [deer's water] in Marathi
                                is because the deer gets deceived at it's sight and runs to get it's thirst quenched,
                                thinking it to be real water, but gets disillusioned. To consider the appearance
                                of water as true is the deer's attitude, but even if it appears as water to a man,
                                he does not run to it to quench his thirst even if he is thirsty. The reason for
                                this is that mirage is not as it appears and the man understands that there is not
                                a drop of water in that place. He is not deceived. This then is the human attitude.
                                Now from the point of view of the sun, there is nothing like a mirage at all! Why
                                even consider it?
                            </p>

                                It is in this manner that the attitude of the aspirant who is ignorant and bound,
                                and the attitude of a seer of Truth [siddha] who is liberated, are at a variance.
                                The one who is bound is driving the cart of practical duties, taking it for granted
                                that the world is true. When the aspirant attains knowledge of the Self, he looks
                                at the world with the attitude that it is just an appearance. But a siddha, the
                                one who has become Self or All, does not see the world at all!

                                So far, everything regarding the physical gross body up to the Supra-causal body
                                has been discussed. The part after the Supra-causal body is the affirmation of this
                                Principle. Even if the aspirant attains Self-knowledge by entering the Supra-causal
                                body, he cannot yet be called a "siddha". He still has to be looked upon as only
                                a sadhaka, or aspirant. The field where the siddhas rest is the field of thoughtless
                                Reality. Let it rest! Why should we discuss that at this stage?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just now, it is the step of the Supra-causal body which is temporarily under our
                                feet. We will discuss it here in more detail. We have said that the Supra-causal
                                body is the state of annihilated ignorance. But ignorance, or the state of forgetfulness,
                                is a state which comes into consideration only in relation to the gross and subtle
                                bodies. Actually it has no real existence, and yet this ignorant state has to be
                                annihilated by acquiring knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is ridiculous to say "that which is not" has to be annihilated! For example,
                                Ram has a ring, but Govind does not have a ring. Does the absence of a ring actually
                                denote the state of existence of a certain thing called a "ring"? No, it does not.
                                Exactly in the same way, the state of forgetfulness&mdash;which is really non-existent
                               &mdash;arises only in relationship with the gross and subtle bodies, and it is an imagined
                                state. It surely does not exist. Samartha Ramdas has proved in his monumental book
                                <i>Dasbodh, </i>that "this state of ignorance" in the form of forgetfulness is the
                                state in which "that which is not" becomes non-existent. Does the state of Self-knowledge
                                really exist? One who has seen the absence of all dreams and doubts, and knows the
                                absence of everything&mdash;as in the state of forgetfulness&mdash;he knows that he
                                too does not exist. The God of Knowledge [Jnanadeva] witnesses the dissolution of
                                the modification of knowledge. He is the President in the Supra-causal body. This
                                witnessing knowledge is also actually a parasite, an unwanted growth, which imposes
                                itself on the pure nature of the Self. It is ignorance in the causal body and should
                                be renounced. As soon as this witnessing knowledge leaves the body by forgetting
                                the state of forgetfulness, then true knowledge of the Self starts looking at itself.
                                Observation of one's own Self cannot be called "witnessing". When one forgets one's
                                own Self and sees something else which is different from one's Self, only then the
                                "seer" can be called a "witness". But when one starts seeing oneself as the unique
                                Reality, one abides in this true knowledge. That knowledge is of the nature of the
                                Absolute.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here also in that "aloneness", one likes humming to oneself, "Aham Brahmasmi" ["I
                                am Brahman"]. With that sound, which rises from within, even this knowledge gets
                                bound and caught in the Supra-causal body. This "hum" is the "grand illusion", the
                                mahamaya, and is of the nature of the three gunas. If one wants to get rid of this
                                beating, the humming sound also has to stop, so that the rumbling mahamaya is permanently
                                abandoned. "I am Brahman" is a type of "I"-ness imposed on the nature of Self, and
                                is really speaking of the absence of ego or a separate self. However, this subtle
                                type of "I"-ness is like a particle of salt in milk, and therefore has to be eradicated
                                as well. To take the false as true is a pretty and wicked idea, but to take the
                                true as true is the absence of such an idea. By virtue of this statement, the gross
                                body is "I", the subtle body is "I", and the causal body is also "I". So long as
                                man continues to uphold his ego as these three bodies, it certainly is a type of
                                wicked pride. Yet, the "knowingness" which sustains the "I" as "I am Brahman" can
                                be called "no-pride" or "egolessness", because this "I"-ness is upholding the Truth.
                                Where is the falsehood in it? Actually, there is nothing untrue or false, but if
                                the true one goes on announcing that "I am true! I am true!", then there arises
                                a doubt about that which he calls the Truth. For example, if a brahmin goes on telling
                                everybody he meets "I am a brahmin! I am a brahmin!", then the hearer will think
                                to himself, "If this man is a brahmin, then what is the reason for him to repeat
                                this to everybody? Actually, he must be of some lower caste."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the same way, by repeating this incantation "I am Brahman! I am Brahman!", it
                                has to be stated that this "knowingness"&mdash;or knowledge in the Supra-causal body
                               &mdash;seems as if it has not yet become free from doubt about it's own true nature.
                                From this point of view, even the memory of "I am Brahman" which reminds one of
                                the Self, has to be erased and "knowingness" should be allowed to stabilise in a
                                state which is neither memory nor forgetfulness. Then alone the aspirant becomes
                                of the nature of pure knowledge and bliss. Even when he takes his usual daily gross
                                experience into consideration, he is in a natural state which is without any remembrance
                                or forgetfulness. Does anyone have the following kind of experience&mdash;"I have
                                forgotten myself" or "I was remembering myself"? By making such efforts, has anyone
                                succeeded in proving their existence? We need not forget nor remember ourselves.
                                It is unnecessary. We are in a natural state which is beyond the state of remembrance
                                or forgetfulness. That is really our true nature. Remembrance or forgetfulness is
                                always of some other thing which is not our own Self. From this Truth, one should
                                make a firm mental decision that whatever is remembered or forgotten is not "I".
                                This should be your firm conviction. Then whatever you can remember and whatever
                                you can forget is definitely not you. While there is no memory of Self or forgetfulness
                                of Self, just being one's Self is to be recognised as Self-illumination. Thus, the
                                gross body is not you, the subtle body is not you and the causal body is not you.
                                You are the Self whose nature is of the knowledge, "I am in the Supra-causal body."
                                You must constantly be the same.

                            <p>
                                By the theory of elimination, according to the instruction given above, once the
                                conviction of one's true nature as pure knowledge is inculcated in the aspirant,
                                then the <i>Vedas</i> have collectively considered the four bodies by the method
                                of deduction. Until now, it has been explained that you are not the three bodies,
                                but the <i>Vedas</i>, again turning back, have enunciated that all this visible
                                appearance is you&mdash;the world sprouts from your "knowingness". The theorem is
                                like this&mdash;a thing produced is like the thing from which it is produced. Suppose
                                water is turned into ice, it still is only water. One may superficially see that
                                water has a flowing tendency while ice is solid and that water has no shape while
                                ice has a shape. Yet they are still one and the same.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Accordingly, the world and its Lord are one and the same. This is the enunciation
                                in the <i>Vedas</i>&mdash;earth, water, heat, light, air, sky and Self, though from
                                a gross point of view appear different due to the difference in quality, are one
                                and the same. As ice becomes water after melting, so also the earth dissolves in
                                water, water gets dried up by heat and light, heat is contained in the air and the
                                air spreads in the sky and just disappears; and because the sky is the womb or all
                                these five elements, they all disappear in the Self. If these principles were absolutely
                                different from each other, they would never be able to dissolve into each other
                                as one without any remnant of difference. So these five elements and this gross
                                and subtle world are the Self only, despite appearing as different characters and
                                species. When a artist paints a tree, a stone, cows, buffaloes, a river, the sky,
                                gods and demons and human beings&mdash;it is all painted with one single thing called
                                "paint". So also, this spectre in the infinite number of forms is nothing but pure
                                knowledge. This has been the bold and convincing deduction. One thing has to be
                                mentioned here&mdash;whether by method of deduction or elimination, or by adopting
                                different contradictory methods, the method itself is of secondary importance, while
                                the main purpose is to impart the knowledge of the Self. When an example in arithmetic
                                is solved by different boys in different ways and the answer is the same, then it
                                becomes compulsory to accept the answer as right. The importance is given to the
                                answer, and the method of arriving at the answer is only subsidiary. That is how
                                the <i>Vedas</i> have accepted and expanded such a method in order to explain to
                                the aspirant the nature of his true Self.

                                There is a kind of snag in proving the identity of water and ice, of the world and
                                God, or gold and jewellery. Through a method of deduction, even if the gold and
                                the ornaments are the same until the goldsmith has tried his skill on the gold,
                                the ornament could not be manufactured without the goldsmith. So too, water could
                                only turn into ice by virtue of intense cold. Thus, though the world and God are
                                the same, still the rationale presents itself like this&mdash;that there was a transformation
                                in God, that He solidified as earth, or melted and became water and then dried up
                                and became heat, etc... In this way, first, the Lord became the five elements and
                                then the world was formed out of these five elements. This is a fault of the method
                                of deduction and an objection can be raised in this way. However, Samartha Ramdas
                                has eradicated even this objection by the sentence, "Oh man, what are you asking
                                of a thing that does not exist at all? The world has not come at all into existence
                                while the absolute Reality alone is."

                                To forget one's Self is the birth of maya, "that which is not", "that which does
                                not exist". How can one describe this nonentity? Does the son of a barren woman
                                have a fair or dark complexion? What is his height? What is his breadth? What is
                                his caste? How can we answer all these questions? Absolute Reality alone is.

                                To keep the child quiet from crying, he is told, "The scarecrow has come." He is
                                quietened by the creation of a scarecrow which is not there. He is kept quiet. After
                                the child becomes quiet he asks his father, "Daddy, what does the scarecrow look
                                like? How long is it's beard and moustache? Does it have a big nose, big eyes and
                                big teeth?" When the child shoots these questions at his father, what answer can
                                the father give? But unless he responds, the child is not going to keep quiet. At
                                such a time, the father has to stretch the scarecrow's nose as far as Rameshwaran
                                [town in Tamil Nadu], his feet up to the Netherlands and his head has to reach the
                                sky. Thus saying whatever he likes, he just draws a frightening picture of this
                                imaginary scarecrow and says, "He is like this, so don't cry again." This sort of
                                description alone will match the description of maya, the unreal world appearance.

                                The non-existent maya exists and she has created this world. The <i>Vedas </i>try
                                to explain to the aspirant how this world was created and what is the nature of
                                maya. According to his capacity to understand, the aspirant can then discover the
                                Source of this maya and this world. "This way it just happened." The reasoning for
                                deduction of a thing contradicts another theory. Yet instead of accusing the <i>Vedas</i>
                                of cheating because they describe one way to A, and another way to B, it must be
                                said that the <i>Vedas</i> have explained the knowledge of the Self to all. They
                                eradicated the illusion, which was the result of the aspirant using their particular
                                spectacles in the form of their personal intellects, and thus were cheating themselves
                                as to the real nature of this world.

                                A mother gives porridge to one child, but gives a roti [bread] made of different
                                grains to another child as he is suffering from indigestion. Can you call this mother
                                partial? This mother knows which food would be beneficial to which child. The same
                                thing can be said of the <i>Vedas</i> regarding the methods they have used&mdash;different
                                methods for different types of aspirants. They are different according to their
                                different intellects, and they all are suffering from the disease of this objective
                                world [samsara], which means that the idea of a "world" has been created. To treat
                                the disease of this idea, the <i>Vedas</i> explain the path to Self-knowledge in
                                different ways according to the learner's understanding capacity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even if fever is one symptom, a clever doctor will give different medicines according
                                to the physical condition of the patient. The ideal before his eyes is just one
                               &mdash;the restoration of good health. There would be difference in medicines administered,
                                but not in the ideology. If one medicine suits one patient, it may not suit another
                                one having a different physical condition. Thus instructions given to one may not
                                appeal to another. The knowledge or advice given to an aspirant who has a certain
                                background may be useless for the one who has either a higher or a lower background.
                                So there is no fault regarding the methods of exposition which the <i>Vedas</i>
                                have accepted. The faults are present in the mental background of the aspirant at
                                the time when the exposition is made. Whatever the <i>Vedas</i> have told anyone,
                                their Final goal is to make all the children understand what is Self-knowledge,
                                and therefore, the aspirant should reject the fault finding attitude and fulfil
                                himself by achieving his own life's goal of acquiring the knowledge of the Self.
