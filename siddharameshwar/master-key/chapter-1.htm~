                                        Siddharameshwar Maharaj wished that people all over the world be happy. His teaching
                                        is available to those who are fully dedicated to realising Final Reality [Brahman]
                                        so that they may enjoy Eternal happiness

                                        The following exposition describes only one of the ways to attain Final Reality&mdash;the
                                        knowledge that you are apart from the four bodies. Once this knowledge penetrates
                                        the heart, the ego of knowledge dissolves in Reality.
                                    </p>

                                At the beginning of this exposition, reverential adoration has to be offered to
                                Sri Ganesh first, then to Sri Saraswati and finally to Sri Satguru. What is the
                                reason for offering salutations in this order? If someone were to ask, "If the sequence
                                of this adoration is changed will there be confusion?" The answer has to be, "Yes,
                                there will be confusion." This is because Sri Ganesh is the deity for meditation
                                and contemplation, and Sri Saraswati is the deity for the exposition of the teaching
                                through words. With the help of these two deities, a third deity in the form of
                                "Light of the Self" will rise in the heart of an aspirant. This deity is none other
                                than the Satguru, which necessarily has to be adored after Sri Ganesh and Sri Saraswati.
                                The study of this textual exposition reveals the subject before the eyes. When the
                                understanding of the subject becomes firm, only then does the Grace of the Satguru,
                                the Self, descend. Neither the exposition of this text, nor the contemplation of
                                its content, will by themselves lead the aspirant to the goal. Hence, one should
                                reverentially adore both Sri Ganesh and Sri Saraswati simultaneously.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is an ancient method of expounding the teaching of Vedanta that is commonly
                                followed in this tradition [Sampradaya] when presenting the subject matter of this
                                text to the aspirant. According to this method, first the manifest form of the Satguru
                                is seen by the eyes. Then the knowledge about the teachings of the Vedanta, and
                                value and significance of these precious teachings is extolled through the words
                                of the Guru. Then a mantra [subtle name of God] is given and the aspirant is instructed
                                to practice meditation on the repetition of the mantra for a short period of time
                                to imprint its significance within. This provides a means for the aspirant to make
                                the mind more subtle so that the teachings that follow can be more easily grasped
                                and realised. This is the seekers' initiation to the teaching an invitation to become
                                an aspirant on the path to realisation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In accordance with the method of the saints that have been outlined above, the Satguru
                                first explains about the subject that is to follow, then indicates its characteristics,
                                and finally follows by imparting a detailed knowledge of the subject. In most schools
                                of education, when teaching small children about any subject, the teachers first
                                verbally informs the child about the subject matter that will be taught. This is
                                called the "kindergarten method of education". Similarly, initially the Satguru
                                verbally gives you a concept or idea of Reality, such as "You are Reality" or "Only
                                Reality exists", or some other similar form of mantra, that is to be contemplated
                                upon. Through repetition or churning, this idea will be indelibly imprinted on the
                                mind. This is the tradition of the Satguru, the direct learning method, and through
                                this preliminary method the aspirant achieves results sooner. So be it!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Afterwards, the Guru expounds the Truth [the subject matter] to an ordinarily intelligent
                                aspirant, and he intellectually understands what the Satguru conveys through the
                                teaching. However, the main difficulty is in experientially realising the Truth
                                about what has been intellectually understood. Through the exposition of the subject
                                by the Satguru, one understands what the Self is. However, the ghost of doubts pops
                                up in the mind of the aspirant in the form of the question, "How can I be the Self?",
                                and the aspirant's mental attitude does not become free of doubt. There is an intellectual
                                understanding, but no realisation! The remedy for this is to study with determination,
                                and learn the teaching. Unless there is sustained and repeated study, it will not
                                be fully understood and realised.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, in the instructional handwriting book, the letters presented are very
                                beautiful. We understand this, but initially we cannot write the letters in the
                                same way. If however the same letters are written repeatedly, then by virtue of
                                that practice or study, the letters are beautifully formed as soon as the pen touches
                                the paper. Here someone might ask, "How much study or practice is required to learn
                                the subject well?" The answer is, "The study, and the practice, or effort, must
                                continue relentlessly according to each one's capacity until it is understood or
                                realised."

                                A general rule can be enunciated here – "An ordinarily intelligent man can understand
                                it if it is explained to him two or three times. If he repeats it ten or twenty
                                times it becomes a habit. If he repeats it a hundred times it becomes an addiction.
                                Once he becomes familiar with it a thousand times, it becomes inherent nature of
                                the one who practises it."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wisps of jute are so delicate and fine that they are scattered in all the ten directions
                                when blown by the wind. However, when the same wisps are entwined together they
                                form a rope, so strong that it can bind even a strong and violent elephant to a
                                small peg. So great is the power of study of this type of practice or repetition!
                            </p>

                                It is indeed true that ultimate Reality [Parabrahman] is all-pervading and ever-free.
                                Yet, the mind in the form of air has become so strong in us, due to the misdirected
                                practice and study through birth after birth that it has imprisoned the ever-free
                                Reality in the thought of identification with the body. This is the tremendous result
                                of repeated practice – "Whatever is unachievable becomes achievable only by virtue
                                of study, repetition and practice." Recognising the importance of this study, the
                                aspirant should adore Ganesh and Saraswati. This means that he should fulfil himself
                                by continuous meditation and learn through the hearing of the exposition of Truth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, before he begins this study, it will be desirable for the aspirant to know
                                about other things relevant to the subject of study. Why has the illusion "I am
                                the body" arisen in a human being? What was the condition of the human being when
                                an "I" was born? How did he develop the idea of "me" and "mine"? Was the condition
                                in the world free from fear? If not, by whom and how can he be helped to get rid
                                of that fear? All this must be deliberated upon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At first, the human being was lying all twisted up in a small space inside his mother's
                                womb. When he was born, he came out into this boundless world, and slightly opened
                                his eyes and looked around. On seeing the immense space and tremendous light, his
                                eyes dipped and he was aghast. "Where have I come alone? Who is going to give me
                                support? What is going to be my fate?" This type of fear arose in his mind. Immediately
                                after birth, with the first shock, he started to cry. After a little while, he was
                                given a drop of honey to lick. With this he felt relieved, thinking all was well
                                and that he had someone's support: thus he pacified himself. But that first shock
                                of fear was so ingrained in his psyche that he got startled at the slightest sound,
                                and yet again he becomes quiet when he gets honey or his mother's breast. In this
                                way, taking external support at every step, this human being keeps on sustaining
                                his life depending on the support of his parents.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As he grows older, his teachers along with his parents start giving him knowledge
                                about the world. After that the school teachers prepare him in the physical sciences
                                such as geography, geometry, geology, which are valueless like dust. Now this being
                                enters the stage of "youth" and again looks out for further props for his life.
                                Then, as it is predetermined in this world, that support for life comes from money,
                                wife, family, etc., this human being gathers wealth and takes on a wife. He takes
                                it for certain that he can be sustained on this support alone and squanders away
                                time. With fame, learning, power an authority, wealth and wife, he gets added prosperity
                                and becomes more and more entangled.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The principal possessions and his entire life are his wife, wealth, status, youth,
                                beauty and authority. Thus, he takes special pride in these things and under that
                                intoxication, the human being misses knowing his real nature. Pride about money,
                                pride about authority, pride about beauty – all such types of pride get absorbed
                                in the man and he forgets his real nature. When his possessions start dwindling
                                one by one according to the law of nature, the memory of the primary shock he had
                                received shakes him to the very roots and he gets frustrated.

                                He panics, "What shall I do now? I am losing support from all sides. What will happen
                                to me?" But this ignorant man does not understand that all these possessions had
                                only one solid support: his "I am"-ness. With that support alone money had its
                                value, his wife appeared charming, the honour received seemed worthwhile, his learning
                                brought him wisdom, his form acquired beauty and his authority wielded power. Oh
                                man, you yourself are the support of all the above described wealth! Can there be
                                a greater paradox than to feel that wealth gave you support? Added to this wealth,
                                power, wife, youth and beauty of form, and honour, if he further received ill-gotten
                                fortune, how strange would his actions become?

                                A poet once described the pranks of the mind as: "Primarily a drunk monkey that
                                gets bitten by a scorpion." Even such a poet would put his pen down seeing the ludicrous
                                absurdities of this human being and would bid goodbye to his poetic talents.

                                The sort of man who considers his body as God and is absorbed in its worship day
                                and night should be considered as a shoemaker who carries hide on his back. An apt
                                proverb is that a shoemaker's God should be worshipped only with shoes. This tells
                                us the way in which this "God" [body] of the said man has to be adored. The devotion
                                of an atheist is to feed his body, and his liberation is the death of the body.
                                For such a man whose ultimate goal in life is feeding his body and his liberation
                                is death, there is no rising above the gross body level. This is not surprising
                                in his case! If due to some misfortune he were to lose all his wealth, he would
                                still borrow money to indulge in his habits of eating, drinking and enjoying. And
                                if his creditors were to hound him, he would declare insolvency and thus get rid
                                of the whole issue. And when death strikes him ultimately, he just lies dead. He
                                passes away just as he came. Could there be anything more tragically wretched than
                                this sort of life?

                                The woman who showers praise on her husband for getting her a lovely nose ring,
                                why should she think of the Lord who provided her with a nose to put the nose ring
                                in?! In the same way, these animalistic human beings who only look to the body as
                                the "be all and end all", how can they see God, their own Self ? The One whose power
                                gives the sun its existence as the sun, the moon its existence as the moon, the
                                gods their existence as gods – who is the support of all and present in the hearts
                                of all beings – this One has become invisible to man! So be it!

                                The man whose eyes are trained outwards sees only that which is external. The eyes
                                will bring him information of only the external objects. Gross objects will be visualised
                                by the gross eye and the subtle will be sensed by the senses, which are also gross,
                                but knowledge cannot be seen either by the gross external eye or the subtle eye
                                of the intellect. Like the physical eye, the other sense organs are all pointing
                                outwards and continue to exist on the strength of external objects.

                                knowledge, the "I am", persuades all the senses and seems to grant them Lordship.
                                It is because of this externalisation, that the fact that he is present prior to
                                the senses does not attract anyone's attention.

                                the saints follow when they turn towards the opposite direction and behold mind,
                                completely giving up seeing what is external.

                                skilful in this sort of awakening. The saints, however, have closed their eyes to
                                the external things. The subject of Self, to which the other beings are asleep,
                                keeps the saints wide awake.

                                turn back, oh man, or you will get caught in a whirlpool. As this illusion [world
                                appearance] has fully come during high tide, you will certainly get carried away
                                by it."

                                The modern advances that come to this world with newer and newer additions, and
                                those that are yet to come, make up a cyclone of illusions. Be certain that you
                                will be held captive by it. Who knows to where this man who is caught by this cyclone
                                is carried away? When the saints see this person whose attention is taken up by
                                these modern advances, running here and there, and struggling with them, they try
                                their utmost to bring about an awakening of Self-knowledge in him. Indeed, that
                                will be an auspicious day when the world in the form of Kumbhakarna [a demon character
                                in the <i>Ramayana</i> epic who eventually attains salvation] awakens from his present
                                deep slumber!

                                Samartha Ramdas and Saint Tukaram [two great Maharashtrian saints from the 17th
                                century] met each other while standing on the opposite banks of a river. Ramdas
                                asked Tukaram with a gesture of his hand, "How much awakening have you brought about
                                amongst people?" Tukaram also replied with a gesture. He formed his right hand in
                                to a fist and put the back of it to his lips, indicating that nowhere had he found
                                anybody who cared for awakening to the Self. Tukaram put the same question to Ramdas
                                and Ramdas suggested that there was no awakening wheresoever. Then they went their
                                own way. Even when this was the case, these merciful saints have consistently continued
                                to do their work. "How can I describe the obligations of these saints? They are
                                continuously awakening me from sleep."
                            </p>

                                It is true that from the bodily point of view Saint Tukaram and Samartha Ramdas
                                have left us today, yet <i>Abhangagatha</i> and <i>Dasbodh </i>remain with us and
                                contain all that they wanted to tell us. Whatever wealth they wanted to hand over
                                to us, they have left the legacy in their will in the form of these books. Whoever
                                makes a claim that he is their legatee will get the whole of that wealth.

                                But the
                                man who wants this wealth must give up the pride he has accumulated in his mundane,
                                worldly, demoniac wealth. Not only this, whatever acts he has considered as achieving
                                merit, and therefore dear to his heart, must also be renounced. He must be prepared
                                to take a step on the path that turns inward. This is the only condition for becoming
                                a beneficiary to this will.

                                Man is fully immersed in the pride of his body, his
                                caste, his family, his country, his nation, and whatever good or bad is in his nature.
                                All these types of pride have possessed him. Until such time as he becomes completely
                                free from pride, how can he claim to benefit from the legacy of this treasure that
                                saints have left behind for him? But one whose heart sincerely repents can become
                                the beneficiary of this wealth that the saints have left.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  The man who sincerely
                                repents, yet worries whether he can rid himself of all these types of pride which
                                he has acquired birth after birth, and which have thus become his second nature,
                                need not worry nor be frustrated. For if a slave is awakened to the knowledge that
                                he is a slave, he instantly starts looking for a way to freedom. A slave who finds
                                joy in his slavery and makes every effort to continue in that condition cannot even
                                think that a highway to freedom exists. Only when he repents will the consciousness
                                of slavery dawn on him.
                                </p>

                                 Similarly, a lucky man may get the feeling that the ambition
                                of going ahead of the other is actually taking him on a downward path. From that
                                day on he gets a glimpse of the reverse direction shown by the saints. He may be
                                slow, but automatically he starts making the effort to step onto a new path.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All those types of pride, bad or good, may not leave a man all at once, but if he
                                starts with a determination to become completely bereft of pride and leaves them
                                one by one, the infinite merciful Lord will not fail to give him a helping hand.
                                If a man takes pride in his vicious acts, this should be broken by increasing pride
                                in his good acts. Thus, through practice all bad qualities will be eradicated. Good
                                qualities should be nourished and imbibed, however one should not be attached to
                                them at all and not even allow them to leave any impression.
                                  </p>
                                <p>
                                 Here a doubt might
                                arise, that though vices deserve to be rejected, why should good qualities also
                                be rejected? After all, good qualities are always good. But dear aspirants, though
                                the possession of good qualities in comparison with vices seems to be better, in
                                the pursuance of attaining the wealth of Self-knowledge, these good qualities are
                                a hundred times worse and also deserve to be thrown away. Just see that a man with
                                several bad qualities will try to be good only because he possesses a sense of shame
                                in his mind. This shame has come from the society in which he lives. But a man that
                                possesses good qualities is always receiving praise in the world, and thus when
                                he is full of pride about his good qualities, it becomes very difficult for him
                                to move away from that pride.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whereas the pride regarding bad qualities can be left fairly easy, it is not the
                                case with pride about good qualities. Nobody admits that he has committed a sin,
                                but the pride that enters a man when he has given meals to thousands, has visited
                                the four holy places, has opened up holy lodges for people or has worshipped the
                                deity ten million times, this pride has become so firm in him that it becomes almost
                                impossible to give up. By repentance, a sinner soon finds a Satguru. However, the
                                one who has done meritorious deeds gets so deeply buried in flattery showered on
                                him by the world that even his way to the Satguru gets buried and lost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When one realises this, one must conclude that pride about bad qualities is tolerable
                                but the pride about good qualities is best avoided completely. Both types of pride
                                are thorns on the way to knowing the Self. When one thorn is pulled out by another,
                                the second thorn is placed in your shirt pocket. This is the pride of good qualities.
                                Will this thorn not eventually prick you? If a thief is shackled in iron handcuffs
                                and a king in golden handcuffs, does it mean that the king is not bound at all?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But even as the man thanks someone who unlocks the iron handcuffs, the man with
                                golden handcuffs will pounce on the throat of him who tries to free him. He will
                                try his best to keep the golden handcuffs permanently on his wrists. Due to what
                                force is this so? Who is this friendly enemy of man who makes him feel happy in
                                bondage? It is the pride of good, meritorious deeds that has caught man by the neck
                                and is the real arch enemy of man. This is the enemy that blocks the way to absolute
                                Truth [Paramartha] more persistently, and therefore it is necessary to renounce
                                it. This may require tremendous labour because without renouncing it, we can never
                                claim our legacy to the wealth of true knowledge [jnana].

                                It is believed that man's wealth, such as money, beautiful wife, status, etc., is
                                a result of meritorious deeds done in previous births. But on the way to finding
                                ultimate Truth, these very things act as boulders obstructing the way. Therefore
                                it may be said that these are the result of sin. When a person is infused with pride
                                about these things, he becomes possessed. Therefore he becomes incapacitated of
                                treading the path of absolute Truth.

                                Contrary to this there might be a man who has not a penny, who is quite ugly, has
                                no wife, no status and is so poverty stricken that in order to fill his belly he
                                eats whatever the food he get sfrom whomsoever he gets it. He lost his caste, family,
                                friends and all dear ones. This type of a fakir, naked on all fronts even if believed
                                to be sinful by the world, might be more worthy of receiving Self-knowledge because
                                he is naturally free of pride. The ears of this naked man turn towards the Satguru
                                sooner than the one whose ears are filled with flattery and have no room for containing
                                the advice of the Satguru. They have no time to turn to the Satguru's advice even
                                for a minute.

                                The whole of humanity has got entangled, right from birth, in bondage. Besides this,
                                man has created several artificial bondages around himself in the form of comforts
                                resulting from newer inventions. If man has to live in present society, he has to
                                respect and conform to the bondages of tradition, social conventions and governmental
                                rules. For example, wearing a neck tie is supposed to be the proper etiquette nowadays.
                                To be up-to-date in such a society makes him believe that he is getting more and
                                more freedom. One who does not drink poisonous tea, or one who does not shave everyday
                                is supposed to be a rustic. Diving into the bondage of such a society and building
                                such silly ideas dear to the heart, this man goes on binding himself further and
                                increases his pride about worthless things. Unless such bonds and pride are thrown
                                away completely, and unless he is called a "mad man" by these "up-to-date" people,
                                there is no hope at all for him to attain a mental state without any pride or become
                                free from bondage at anytime!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only aim is that one should completely shed off all pride and eradicate the
                                identification with the body. If the aspirant finds all this work difficult to do
                                or is unwilling to take it upon himself to formally renounce his wife, his money
                                and his estate, then he can begin with inward renunciation. When that becomes successful,
                                the formal renunciation slowly becomes possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Inward renunciation means renunciation undertaken through the mind. Suppose someone
                                has the habit of hurting others through words: it does not cost anything to leave
                                that habit by repeating only sweet words to others. Some people have the habit of
                                telling lies unnecessarily. They should first stop telling lies at least until such
                                time that an occasion arises where unless they tell lies a great calamity may occur.
                                This too will not require any expenditure. While looking at a neighbour's prosperity
                                one should not envy him. Will taking such a decision bring him any harm? In this
                                way, when one renounces bad qualities, one also gets the strength to renounce external
                                things.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This world is like a dream and hence in this dream-world, whatever is considered
                                as good or bad, true or false, merit or sin, moral or immoral – are of no consequence
                                for the awakening of Self. And therefore renunciation of both auspicious and inauspicious,
                                good and bad, is necessary to attain the knowledge of Self. Even if the above is
                                true, men still find it problematic to eradicate pride. No matter how often someone
                                repeats the precept "renounce, renounce", time and again, it will not make even
                                the slightest dent on pride. Only when one discovers the reason why pride enters
                                and is able to eradicate that reason, then renunciation automatically follows. The
                                main reason why pride about an object enters a man is that he takes the object to
                                be true. But if he gets convinced intellectually about the utter uselessness of
                                the object or understands that it is only an appearance, then the apparent reality
                                of the thing fades away automatically. For him it becomes possible to develop a
                                detachment from that object which is held close to his heart as true.

                                A toy tamarind pod from Gokak [in the state of Karnataka] is not a real tamarind
                                pod, but only one made of wood! Yet until such discriminative knowledge dawns on
                                one, the sight of the wooden tamarind is bound to set one's mouth watering. The
                                reason for this is the man's conviction of the thing being true. But once he definitely
                                knows that the tamarind is made of wood, he may appreciate the artistic or aesthetic
                                features of it, but it will not affect his salivary glands! This very happening
                                is detachment and brings us to the conclusion that detachment from a thing follows
                                after understanding its true nature. Unless the futility of this "world" is impressed
                                irrevocably upon man's mind, the knowledge of the Self is difficult to attain. Unless
                                one understands the false nature of an object, one will never aspire for the Real.
                                There can be no renunciation of the false so long as the intellect believes it to
                                be absolutely true.

                                The day the perverse knowledge of the world is set at naught by virtue of the Satguru's
                                advice, then one gets convinced that all this is only an appearance. After this
                                happens, we will be able to look at the world and appreciate it as if it was a cinema
                                or a source of entertainment, but the detachment achieved will remain unaffected.
                                Detachment without Self-knowledge is akin to that experienced at the cremation grounds.
                                Without Self-knowledge there can be no real renunciation and without renouncing
                                there can be no Self-knowledge. This is the paradox.

                                 Saints have shown various methods
                                of getting out of this vortex, by way of devotion to the Guru, singing devotional
                                songs, worship, singing God's glories, visiting holy places, charity, meritorious
                                deeds, etc... In this way they have enjoined an infinite number of obligations for
                                humanity. Human nature is such that if a man is forcibly robbed of a thing, he suffers
                                immensely. He will make persistent effort to regain it. But if he were to part with
                                the same thing out of his free will, that sacrifice would bring him immense joy.
                                A man who is unwilling to spend a dime under compulsion, would out of his free choice
                                spend thousands in order to feed the people of Pandharpur [a religious site in Maharashtra].
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One whose pride does not allow him to bend to other people's will bow in total submission
                                to a much lesser being, after mixing with saints chanting devotional songs. Thus
                                he completely forgets his pride of his caste or status. That Rao Saheb [Honorary
                                Government Member] who felt ashamed to apply sandalwood paste to his forehead in
                                his house now allows black powder [buka] to be smeared on his face, "Thus blackening
                                the face of pride." The same one who considered singing and dancing as obscene forgets
                                himself and his body and starts whirling in joy with a partner, loudly chanting
                                the name of God along with the rest. Understanding how man sacrifices his pride
                                in this way, the saints have spread the cult of singing devotional songs and ceremonial
                                worship for everyday practice. Thus they have pointed out a progressive step on
                                the way to knowledge of Self. In this way they have impressed upon man how easy
                                it is to renounce and how the aspirant's mental attitude gets cleared from pride.

                                Self-knowledge means knowledge about one's Self. Once we recognise who we are, then
                                quite automatically the decision is made about what is permanent and what is transient.
                                Then very naturally the renunciation of the impermanent and acceptance of the permanent
                                follows.
                                 </p>

                             Because of the transient nature of all things, the fear of disillusionment
                                is inevitable. Man overpowered by this fear of death or disillusion, continually
                                strives to see that things do not get separated from him. He takes every precaution
                                to preserve his money and relationships, tries hard to keep his wife's youth and
                                beauty from deteriorating, struggles to keep his status and authority, but nothing
                                happens according to his wish and desire.
                            </p>

                                Death is all-consuming. No one can escape his destiny, and everyone will eventually
                                get crushed under death's teeth. Even gods, like Brahma, were not free from the
                                fear of death. Even if a poor man is given everything, does he still not remain
                                afraid of death? The only gift he needs is the gift of fearlessness. He needs something
                                that will free him permanently from this fear. Man is like a beggar – having lost
                                his own treasure of Self, he continually chants "I am the body, I am the body."
                                He is forever unhappy and unsatisfied, saying "I want this and I want that," and
                                wanders around begging for something or the other. He can be pacified only with
                                the gift of the Self.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fearful man who chants, "What will happen to me, my wife and children, and my
                                money which I consider mine?" is always disturbed and upset. This sort of man should
                                get the gift of fearlessness and thus be made fearless. Only the Satguru is capable
                                and generous enough to bestow such a gift of fearlessness, which is the noblest
                                of all gifts. Kings and emperors, and even gods, are incapable of granting this
                                gift of fearlessness. Although all earthly wealth is at the feet of an emperor,
                                he is still restless with fear at the very thought of an enemy's attack. Lord Indra
                                too is anxious, day and night, with the thought that his status as Indra might be
                                shaken by the penance and austerities performed by some sage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Think of this deeply – those who have not freed themselves from fear, can they
                                give others a gift of fearlessness? Only those Mahatmas who have uprooted fear from
                                its very depths, by establishing themselves in the centre of the Self and destroying
                                the identification with the body, are capable of granting the gift of fearlessness.
                                All the gods, demons and men are penniless beggars in comparison with these Mahatmas.
                                They can never receive the gift of fearlessness, only unless they take shelter from
                                a Satguru. Even if they are gods, they still entertain pride of godly wealth, and
                                demons still carry the pride of their own vicious wealth on their heads. Human beings
                                get crushed under their own burden. Gods are no better than baggage men who carry
                                other people's burdens on their heads! <span class="yellow note80">[sentence]</span> What of the human beggar? It is only
                                the Satguru who extends his hand to help them unload their burden and blesses them
                                at the same time with the gift of fearlessness.

                                Of all knowledge, Self-knowledge is the most noble, and of all dharmas [paths],
                                Swadharma [one's duty or path to one's own true nature of Self] is the most noble.
                                These very Mahatmas spread this knowledge of the Self amongst men and teach the
                                meaning of Swadharma. In this world, the knowledge of astrology, black magic, public
                                relations, 14 types of sciences and 64 arts are taught, but the saints refuse to
                                recognise all this false knowledge and only spread the art and knowledge of the
                                Self.

                                Many missionaries competing with one another assert their opinions by giving advice.
                                They say, "My religion is the noblest and all others will lead man to ruin." Not
                                only do they give advice, but they also fulfil their sacred duty of conversion by
                                bribing, threatening and even killing people. This is going on even today. This
                                piracy of religion, full of compulsion and tyranny, is not useful for accomplishing
                                the well-being of anyone.

                            If there is any one religion in the world which is the
                                noblest of all, it is Swadharma – aligning with one's own true nature. To live
                                in one's innate nature is Swadharma, even while belonging to a certain caste, religion
                                or nation. To understand Swadharma, one should realise that It is existent in all
                                forms of life, be it an ant or an insect. This alone is Swadharma and all other
                                cults, parading as religions, are pardharma [a path that is alien to the Self and
                                devoted to non-Self]. These religions impose absurd rules and methods that are alien
                                to our real nature of Self. That is the definition of pardharma.

                                Supposing there is a prostitute. She also has a relevant dharma which she follows
                                assiduously, believing that it is her Swadharma. She teaches the same to her daughter
                                in the cradle itself and in the end she also dies following her own religion. Who
                                knows if some lover of women comes forward to include that woman's life story in
                                the book of religious saints? The Lord has already cautioned us in the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>
                                by saying, "It is best to die in Swadharma." Dharma which is alien to Self is full
                                of danger. While trying to achieve this, if death comes, it is to be preferred than
                                following that dharma which is alien to Self. The translation of the Lord's verse
                                of caution should carry the above mentioned import. Eradicating the idea of identification
                                with the body is the sign of knowledge of the Self. Mahatmas experience this sort
                                of death while still living. This sort of death is to be preferred.

                                "I have seen my own death. How shall I describe that process which is unique?" How
                                can the cowards living in pardharma, and who die a corps's death, understand this
                                process of death while still living? The unfortunate one only thinks of death in
                                terms of a cremation ground – bamboo, jute rope, dung cakes, wood and fire –
                                and the rites of his religion. Those dharmas, built on the strong basis of body-identification,
                                contain the temptation and fear of heaven and hell, merit and sin, bondage and liberation.

                                Every human being has the right to follow the path of Swadharma – leading to his
                                own Self – where there is no temptation of heavenly enjoyments, no fear of pain
                                in purgatory, and where both bondage and liberation have no meaning. There is a
                                cruel maxim: "Whatever comes has to go." These pseudo-religions are shining and
                                spreading because of their "newness", and in some cases, with government patronisation.
                                They will definitely sink to the bottom, and there will be nothing but glory and
                                victory to Swadharma alone!

                                In the <i>Bhagavad Gita, </i>the Lord advises Arjuna to do one thing: "Leave aside
                                all religions and come seek refuge within Me!" Come to Me by rejecting all religions
                                which create hindrances. Seek refuge in Paramatman, the true Self, which has the
                                nature of true knowledge. You will then have fulfilled yourself when you attain
                                Me and there will be nothing more for you to do. All karma gets exhausted in Self-knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the pretext of advising Arjuna, the Lord has given this advice to all human beings
                                and they should fulfil themselves by accepting the same. There is nothing in the
                                whole universe as sacred as the Self-knowledge. All other "work" or "action" is
                                meaningless. 
                                 </p>
                            <p>
                            In this context, one should not think that all other types of knowledge
                                apart from Self-knowledge are useless and have no value. However, they are of no
                                help in achieving Swadharma. It is not that getting results such as a son, or heaven,
                                by means of performing sacrifices is not possible. By studying scriptures, one does
                                become proficient, and it is possible for one to appease various deities by worshipping
                                them. Even if this is so, and even if all these actions are supposed to be meritorious
                                in this mundane practical world, they still come as hindrances so long as the Self
                                is not pleased and does not shower His Grace. 
                                 </p>

                                The qualities valued as best in the
                                practical world count as disqualifications, and all remedies only turn into obstacles.
                                The sages know this well and do not care a whit even if they are able to conquer
                                all the three worlds of existence [physical, subtle and causal]. They consider Indra's
                                status, ridden as it is with jealousy, as useless as a crow's droppings.

                             All the
                                saints harbour only one desire within their hearts – to achieve oneness with Reality.
                                Otherwise, desirelessness is their stance. These men of good fortune became one
                                with Reality when their consciousness separated from the body. In ordinary cases,
                                the body is taken only as a corpse while, in the case of the Mahatmas, they become
                                worthy of obeisance and they receive adoration from people. Not only this, several
                                temples are built on their shrines. Thus, they become immortal by becoming the object
                                of worship and adoration from the whole world.

                                Ram, Krishna, Siddhartha, Hanuman, Malhari and Jagadamba – all these were Mahatmas
                                in the form of Gurus. While they were alive they did the work of spreading true
                                knowledge and became gods when they left the body. All the temples on earth belong
                                to these very gods who grant the wishes of devotees according to their vows and
                                desires. They lift the aspirant to their own level and make them achieve fulfilment.

                                Many people think that the God he worships meets him, through visions, and gets
                                the work done, but God is not limited to one point or place as the devotee imagines.
                                He resides in the devotee's heart as in every heart and inspires to get one's work
                                done. Nobody should entertain the wrong idea that even after the Mahatma leaves
                                his body, he assumes the same body, comes out of his tomb [samadhi] and then gets
                                his devotee's work done!

                                When you wish to send ten rupees to someone in Pune, you give a ten rupee note to
                                the Post Office at Sholapur for them to transfer the money to that particular person.
                                On the second or third day you get the receipt that the amount was delivered to
                                the recipient. Have you ever made enquiries to find out whether the same ten rupee
                                note, with the same number, was given to the recipient? This type of question never
                                arises in your mind. Your attention is centred not on the number of the note, but
                                on the value of the note, and when the amount has reached the person you do not
                                have any complaints or queries. In the same way, these saints and Mahatmas, who
                                have turned into gods, get the devotees work accomplished through the living Mahatmas
                                that are available and who are of the same calibre. This is the way they get their
                                devotees' vows fulfilled.

                                What magical skill did these persons possess who were honoured during their lifetime
                                and became immortal, retaining their fame even after their bodily death? What special
                                learning did they have that they should be receiving adoration from people even
                                after death?

                                In this world, there are many arts and sciences. Many discoverers, many adventurous
                                heroes who are praised during their lifetime. These heroes are felicitated and covered
                                with garlands and flowers. People even express their admiration for them by deyoking
                                the horses of their carriages and by carrying them on their shoulders! But at the
                                same time, a hero who has been an object of people's adoration also becomes subject
                                to their censure. Soon, people who are pampered as heroes for a few days are condemned
                                in an assembly. Even resolutions condemning them are carried out! From this it is
                                clear that the greatness of these heroes is artificial and not everlasting, because
                                their greatness is based on their transient learning. Their greatness is not based
                                on the sacred, everlasting peace, but on some practical motive or some physical
                                sciences, like politics. Who was once judged as "great" is found to be of no importance,
                                and in some other corner of the world another "hero" starts shining on the horizon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The greatness which is achieved through any learning other than the knowledge of
                                the Self, takes an opposite direction, due to which these great ones have to suffer
                                sweet and sour experiences of honour and insult. It is no wonder that no one takes
                                the trouble of thinking about the great men after they are dead. Out of all knowledge,
                                Self-knowledge is the only learning which grants everlasting peace. What is the
                                use of such learning which does not grant peace of mind?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nowadays, many types of courses of learning are available in the world. Why is there
                                such a proliferation of courses? The reason is because no one has yet found peace
                                of mind. The struggle has not yet stopped, not even for a little while, and the
                                mind remains ever restless. Why? Because all these sciences and arts have got their
                                entire centre in ignorance and are only useful for increasing the agitation and
                                restlessness of the human mind. The one who values the sciences and arts has lost
                                the happiness that comes from peace of mind. He is unable to examine himself. The
                                man who does not know who he is, he is never free from restlessness. It is futile
                                to know many addresses if one does not even know his own address! One who has not
                                searched his own house, why should he search another man's house for a thing he
                                lost in his own house?
