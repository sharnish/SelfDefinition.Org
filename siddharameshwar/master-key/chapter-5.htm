                                Now try to notice the crust of consciousness without an object – pure knowledge
                                without a mixture of any object at all. That vacuum or void which is lying between
                                the eye and the moon did not at all come to your attention, but still it is pervading
                                in its own nature. That is the pure form of knowledge. That void or empty space,
                                though not noticed before, if purposefully made an object of attention, can separately
                                become noticed as space. Whatever can be noticed is illusion, and whatever cannot
                                be seen is Reality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While looking at the moon, the void did not come to your attention, because it is
                                consciousness without any object. If this space or void is separated and is made
                                an object of sight, then this pure knowledge is transformed into zero – if space
                                is seen separately, then the modification of the mind becomes only a void. If there
                                is any difference between the sky and pure knowledge, it is this: to separately
                                look at one's own nature is sky, and when the "looking" is abandoned, it is pure
                                knowledge. Once pure knowledge is recognised properly in this way, then even if
                                it is mixed with any other object, it can be selected and recognised. Once pure
                                water is known, even if it is mixed with anything else, its part can be recognised
                                with that mixture of water.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Water is a fluid, but if it gets condensed and becomes ice, and even if it gives
                                up its fluidity and assumes density, it can still be recognised as water even in
                                that dense form. It is not difficult to recognise the wetness in the mud as water.
                                Just like this, once pure knowledge is known to be existence-knowledge-bliss [satchitananda],
                                that which is immobile in the moving world, then it can also be recognised.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pure water has no colour, no form, no taste and no smell. Once this is properly
                                understood, then even if it is condensed and assumes a dense form, or even enters
                                a hot chilli and tastes hot, or enters a sugarcane and tastes sweet, or becomes
                                fragrant and coloured as rose water or water paint, it is quite recognisable as
                                pure water without a mistake by simply subtracting the form, the taste, the smell
                                and the colour. Thus, by the same method of elimination, even when this pure knowledge
                                is conditioned, by subtraction of that conditioning and by dividing the form into
                                its elements, it will be recognised absolutely correctly as to how pure knowledge
                                alone is filled up to the brim everywhere and in every form. But before one attains
                                this pure knowledge through the method of elimination, if someone accepts the method
                                of elimination and starts prattling about how God alone pervades in all beings,
                                in all the forms, there is none else than Rama, world and the Lord of the world
                                are but One, etc., then his bla bla can never be useful. In contrast with the above,
                                if one just talks such empty words such as "I am Brahman", "The senses do their
                                job", "I am not the doer", "There is no sin or virtue on my doorstep", then instead
                                of gaining the Self, he will only deceive his Self. In this way, all Self-discovery
                                loses its joy for this world as well as for the other world. Kabir says, "He went
                                away as he came." These people die in the same state of consciousness in which they
                                were born. They receive no benefit other than this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These worldly scholars hold the noises of words as true Self-knowledge, but has
                                the merciless Truth ever dawned on an ignorant man? "The senses do their work, yet
                                I am not the senses. The qualities of the mind remain with the mind, the qualities
                                of the body remain with the body, and what have I to do with them? I am different
                                from these." What is untrue about this statement? Who is it that understands the
                                Truth? Who has the experience of the Truth? Only the man who knows who he is. Of
                                what use is it to others? Each one enjoys his own pleasures and bliss. Tukaram accordingly
                                says, "Each one for himself." You can teach a parrot to say the words "Reality is
                                Truth and the world is only an appearance", and it will repeat this without understanding
                                the underlying meaning. Where there is no understanding, there cannot be bliss of
                                Self-knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let that be as it is. However, the aspirant should not be after the one who is a
                                expert in words, who is a hypocrite. With persistent study using the method of elimination,
                                he must first come to know what pure knowledge is. Knowledge is of different types
                                – general knowledge, particular knowledge, objective knowledge, dream knowledge,
                                doubting knowledge, and thoughtless knowledge. Unlike thoughtless knowledge, the
                                others types of knowledge are contradictory to pure knowledge. When the pure consciousness
                                leaves the eyes and takes the external objects within itself, then that pure consciousness
                                takes the shape of those objects and one gets objective knowledge. If the object
                                is gross then one gets objective knowledge, and if it is only a subtle idea, then
                                one gets distinctive [savikalpa] knowledge. Thus, when pure knowledge takes the
                                shape of any object, thought or idea, it can be categorised as particular knowledge.
                                Particular knowledge is artificial and only remains for a very short time, so it
                                inevitably has to be of unsteady nature. However, the rule is that particular knowledge
                                has to turn back to general knowledge, the knowledge "I am".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, we walk with common general speed, but when we increase the speed and
                                run, then that running speed becomes a particular speed. Yet, for how long can we
                                continue to run? After sometime the running has to end and soon one has to assume
                                the natural speed. Just like this, we are naturally very loving and blissful within,
                                therefore the love for oneself is the general and common type of love. But when
                                love is for the son or a friend or a house, it is an unnatural uninvited state of
                                love, and thus this love which comes also goes! This love that "comes" is of a particular
                                kind, and is transient and destructible. The happiness one gains from objects is
                                also of the category of a particular kind, and therefore it is short-lived and only
                                sustains itself for a short time. A small thing brings in an experience of a "particular",
                                but the One that pervades everthing cannot be experienced. The reason is that the
                                "all-pervading" is big and infinite, and actually we are the same "pervading" Reality.
                                The "particular" is illusion and the general or common is Reality. You are That,
                                and therefore you can not experience love for your own Self, nor can you enjoy the
                                happiness or bliss of your Self.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now we have to observe what is called "general knowledge", which is without any
                                object or idea. Between the outside gross object and the eye of the inside mind
                                is some distance. This void or vacuum, though we see it, is as if not seen, and
                                therefore we gain no knowledge of this vacuum. This intervening knowledge, being
                                knowledge itself, cannot become the object of its own knowledge! Knowledge cannot
                                be the object of its own knowledge. How can jaggery [a coarse dark brown sugar produced
                                by evaporating the sap of palm trees] taste its own sweetness? In the same way,
                                knowledge cannot experience or know itself as an object of its own knowledge. This
                                knowledge has spread itself naturally between the eye and the object, and also between
                                the intellect and thought. One should again and again notice how this general pure
                                knowledge naturally pervades us before it takes up an object. But this noticing
                                or seeing of pure knowledge is not the same as seeing an object or thought. It can
                                only be seen when one gives up the idea of "seeing" and the thought, "I am the seer."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The instrument of seeing is the eye and the instrument of knowing a thought is the
                                intellect. Keeping aside both these instruments, pure knowledge alone can be seen.
                                These instruments of the eye and intellect are too blunt. To try to know pure knowledge
                                by means of an eye or intellect is to forget the pure knowledge "I am" and allow
                                the eye and intellect to step in. Knowing that knowledge cannot know itself, you
                                become pure knowledge itself. This is the way of seeing it. One gets separated from
                                it when one tries to meet it. But without trying to meet it, you are always in union
                                with it. This puzzle is very difficult. Wise men and yogis make a mistake here by
                                misinterpreting the seen for the seer. They say, "Supreme Self has four hands, he
                                is like the light of ten million suns, he is lustrous, he has a dark complexion,
                                he is like a point, he is like this and he is like that..." In other words, they
                                say whatever they like. But by whose knowledge was it stated that "He is like this
                                and he is like that"? That one is completely forgotten while they say great things
                                of Self-realisation. The seer is forgotten and the seen is taken to be Reality!
                                One does not know what to say of them. The brave set out to find Reality, but the
                                obstacles in the form of what is seen come in the way. This is the case for the
                                majority of seekers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a crowd at a pilgrimage, I lost myself and could not find myself even when I
                                tried to search within. Then I went to the police station and gave them the information
                                report that I was lost. At that time, a constable came and started slapping me hard
                                on the cheek until it was red, and then he asked me, "Who is this fellow?" Only
                                then did I become conscious of myself and I was very happy that I was found. This
                                is the very condition of the one who is Reality, yet is in search of the Reality.
                                Where, when and how can he find it? The one who knows everybody is not known by
                                anybody. This is the exact position. Yet the one who tries to know him does not
                                know his nature as pure consciousness and starts wandering about in forests and
                                jungles. How amazing this is! The one who remains after the consciousness capacity
                                of knowing has been transcended, how can he be known? Unless one becomes steady
                                within oneself, one cannot attain any knowledge of Reality, and the desire to know
                                will continue.

                                One foolish fellow wanted to know what sleep is. Whenever he would start to dose
                                off, he would immediately remember, "Ah, now I will catch sleep." With this thought
                                he would clap his hands and suddenly he became completely awake. By repeatedly doing
                                this, the poor fellow became so tired that he entirely gave up the effort of trying
                                to catch sleep. To catch Reality the procedure is the same. When one gives up trying
                                to know it, one becomes the very nature of Reality itself. When the gross and subtle
                                bodies get negated, the instruments of mind and intellect get broken up. The aspirants
                                then enters the state of causal body, which is the state of forgetfulness. This
                                itself is the ignorance of the human being. To eradicate this ignorance it is necessary
                                to acquire the knowledge of Reality. Therefore the aspirant, with the help of the
                                subtle intellect, and that part of consciousness which is pure knowledge, tries
                                to get the knowledge of Reality. Shankaracharya has called such a man a "great fool".
                                It is like a woman in menses who tries to clean the ground with cow dung. However,
                                wherever she goes, the floor will become impure instead of pure. So in this manner,
                                if one tries to know the Reality with the subtle intellect, the subtle body's scope
                                will go on increasing. When the subtle body gets destroyed and one enters the causal
                                body, the person who tries to know Reality with the intellect does not get stabilised
                                in the causal body and returns to the subtle body with a bang from the causal body.
                                Once again, he gets caught under the sway of dreams, ideas and doubts.

                                If it can be said that pure knowledge can be gained even if it is polluted by the
                                mind and intellect, then the purity of Reality should remain unsullied, even if
                                he eats in the company of a cobbler sitting next to him. Where speech and mind cannot
                                enter, if the aspirants dreams of using words or mind, he will never progress and
                                instead he will return to a lower plane. The aspirant cannot remain as an aspirant,
                                but has to become a perfected liberated being, and for this purpose one has to cross
                                the posts of all these four bodies. By constant study, one has to enter this platform
                                of the four bodies, clean and purify them, and only then can one invoke the Supreme
                                Truth. Once the aspirant gets established in Reality, it is certain that he becomes
                                a perfected liberated being. Until stabilisation is complete, the exposition regarding
                                the four bodies and the syllabus of its study must continue. Aspirants must have
                                also understood its underlying meaning. Even if a wooden stool with four legs [in
                                the form of the bodies] is built, it is still very crude. In order to make it shine,
                                more effort is required to polish it properly. By polishing a thing, it starts to
                                shine and reflect its own light. The procedure of making a thing is different from
                                the procedure of scrubbing and making it absolutely smooth. Unless it is manufactured
                                in that way, it is not said to be completely ready, nor does it fetch any price.
                                Therefore before becoming a fully liberated being, we have to be aspirants for some
                                time, persistently polishing the pure knowledge in the Supra-causal body. We must
                                make it completely clean.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We may only intellectually know that pure knowledge in the form of absolute Self
                                pervades every form, but in order to study and accept it as Truth, one should try
                                to make everyone happy. With this remedy alone, the Self pervades everything and
                                the whole world is seen to be pure knowledge. When this thesis of the <i>Vedas</i>
                                is proved and experienced, then Self-knowledge gets firmly established. The quality
                                [saguna] of worship of the Supreme Self is only this. Bliss of being is in so many
                                forms, right from an insect, an ant, a dog and a pig. Self alone pervades them all.
                                The Supreme Self, who is formless, qualityless and unmanifest, manifests itself
                                with qualities in the form of the universe. He is of course present in all that
                                is immovable, but he is experienced clearly in the movable beings. Therefore, instead
                                of worshipping the lifeless gross things such as stone and metal idols, it is better
                                to worship the moving, talking, walking God, where the quality of knowledge is clearly
                                experienced. This is saguna worship. Where are the qualities in a stone idol? Out
                                of the three qualities – rajas, sattva and tamas – which quality is to be found
                                in the idols of stone or metal? But in those who are moving, there is at least one
                                or more qualities found. Therefore, all the beings are forms of God.
                            </p>

                                If one prays sincerely to the saints or to a good man who are full of knowledge
                                [sattvaguna], he becomes pleased and grants out wishes. But, if we censure his action
                                [tamoguna], he slaps our face and gives us an experience! Therefore, "Please worship
                                the God who is walking and talking. Worshipping a stone idol is of no use." Kabir
                                has given this warning in clear words. He has advised to worship a walking, talking
                                God alone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As soon as the word "worship" is uttered, sandalwood paste, rice, flowers, haldi
                                kumkum [tumeric powder] come to mind, but to really worship means to please and
                                make happy every human being. Shankara gets pleased with bel leaves, Maruti with
                                simdur powder, Vishnu requires tulsi leaves and Ambabai requires haldi kumkum. If
                                a particular deity gets things other than what are required for his worship, it
                                will only mean mischief and not worship. Though the Supreme Self is One everywhere,
                                the way the devotees worship him differs according to the form of the deity. A donkey
                                has God within it, yet if you fold your hands before it in obeisance, it would be
                                a joke or mischief played on the Supreme Self. Does the donkey get pleased if you
                                fold your hands before him? If the donkey is given green grass to eat and clear
                                water to drink, it would be true worship to God who has taken the form of a donkey.
                                But to God who has taken a human form, feeding him with food to please him is the
                                worship of Supreme Self. And in order to worship this deity, donkey's food should
                                not be offered to him. By giving whatever the form of God wants, the devotees heart
                                is pleased and blessed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A snake and a scorpion are also forms of God, but one should worship them from a
                                distance. It means that they should be left alone to live their own lives. Instead
                                of this, if you start embracing them with devotion, that serpent God will bite you
                                and prove that embracing him is not worshipping him. Here someone may raise a doubt
                                by asking, "How could allowing the snake and scorpion to escape alive be a form
                                of worship? Those beings are wicked and they must be killed." I would ask them in
                                return, "Unless a snake or scorpion is touched or hurt, do they ever bite unnecessarily?"
                                But a man is ever ready to kill them, even if he is at a considerable distance.
                                Is not the nature of man more wicked and cruel than the nature of a snake or scorpion?
                                Yes, because you have a desire to kill them. Let the feeling, "A snake and scorpion
                                are of my nature", become firm in you and then see the miracle that happens! The
                                Self of the snake or scorpion is not a stone. When your Selfhood becomes firm in
                                the snake or scorpion, the Self of the snake or scorpion also becomes one with your
                                Selfhood and there will no longer be a desire in the snake to bite you. As you see
                                a snake as a snake, he also sees an embodied man as an enemy.

                                You will see the same kind of facial expression in the mirror as you have on your
                                face. If you see a bad expression in the reflection, is it the fault of the mirror?
                                If you make a smiling face and look into the mirror, you need not order the reflection
                                in the mirror to make a smiling face. Why does the thief rob our house? Because
                                we also have a continuous desire to rob people in many ways to fill our own house.
                                As we develop the feeling of complete renunciation, then our feeling will reflect
                                in whatever comes before us, and even if you refuse to ask for anything, people
                                are prepared to give up heaps and heaps of whatever they have for you. But whosoever
                                begs for it does not get it.

                                From this discussion, a reader may get confused and say, "Maharaj, your way of thinking
                                does seem right, but as soon as I see a snake, to leave him alone seems impossible,
                                or when someone puts his hand in my pocket to steal money, to take him as God and
                                do nothing is something I can never do." "Agreed", I would say. "Agreed a hundred
                                times!" Oh aspirant, this cannot be possible because of the habits of many, many
                                births. It cannot be achieved all at once. Even if this is true, a beginning can
                                be made from say, the house bugs instead of scorpions or snakes. From a petty action
                                like not killing the house bugs, keeping in mind the Oneness of all, the Oneness
                                of Self in everything and every being, you will eventually attain the feeling of
                                Oneness in all beings, even with those which are more troublesome than the bugs.
                                This experience gradually increases one's confidence. One should not have the feeling,
                                "Bugs are not to be killed, so they should be left alone", but rather have the thought,
                                "They are of my own nature and are my form. Their happiness is my happiness." A
                                mother experiences the feeling of joy by pleasing the child and allowing it to suck
                                at her breast. One should experience the same feeling of satisfaction by allowing
                                the bugs to suck blood out of one's body. This is the beginning, or the first lesson
                                concerning the feeling of Oneness for all beings. Gradually and persistently studying
                                this, the earth will be without an enemy and fearlessness will come your way. You
                                shall be free from all fear.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When an aspirant has no doubt of any kind left in him and he achieves knowledge
                                of the Self, he becomes free. Though true, as yet he cannot experience the glory
                                of real liberation. Richness is one thing, but the joy of the status after becoming
                                rich is another thing. In the same way, unless a feeling of Oneness of all comes
                                to the Self-realised being, his knowledge does not develop or spread out, like a
                                stingy rich man's wealth, and he cannot attain the bliss of liberation while alive.
                                Even if one achieves the knowledge of Self, unless one experiences a feeling of
                                Oneness with all, fearlessness does not come his way. Fearlessness means "full bliss".
                                In quality, fear is a concomitant of duality. Fear is a very great impediment which
                                blocks the bliss arising out of liberation. So after attaining Self-knowledge, the
                                aspirant should worship the Supreme Self in the way explained above. Thus, dry knowledge
                                gets moistened with devotion. A jalebi [Indian sweet] which has been fried in ghee
                                becomes juicy and sweet when put in sugar syrup. In the same way, after attaining
                                Self-knowledge, the Self-realised being achieves fullness of life through devotion.

                                In the game called "Surfati" a player slides first from the lower to the higher
                                house, bringing back with him all that he gets from the other houses. Only then
                                is the game over. By gaining the knowledge all the way from the gross to the Supra-causal
                                body, one has to bring this gift of knowledge back to the lower gross body in the
                                same way. The factual experience that "The world is nothing but knowledge", is itself
                                perfect knowledge becoming thoughtless Reality. It is because of the feeling that
                                there is someone else in the world who is not "I", that we go around night and day
                                with the feeling of anxiety that we should protect our wife, our wealth and our
                                belongings from the clutches of someone else. In this way, we turn into a "gasti"
                                or watchman due to the feeling of possessiveness and ownership! However, when one
                                realises a feeling of "Oneness with everyone" and the feeling that "I am present
                                everywhere, I am pervading everything", on that day the "gasti" becomes an "Agasti",
                                the sage who drank the ocean in one sip. Then this ocean of the five elements may
                                not be enough for even one sip! This is the way in which the devotee who knows his
                                Self becomes fearless while in the body, and enjoys the full celebration of what
                                is called "liberation".

                                Now, at this point, we have given the exposition about Self-knowledge and the devotion
                                after Self-knowledge. We have reached a stage where an aspirant has become a Self-knowing
                                being!! The end of all knowledge of the Supra-causal body bears fruit in seeing
                                the whole world as one's Self. This being true, Samartha Ramdas still has called
                                this knowledge of the Supra-causal body as being "unsteady Brahman [Reality]" when
                                compared with that of the Supreme Self [Paramatman]. Supreme Self is steady and
                                is different from the manifest Reality [saguna Brahman] and unmanifest Reality [nirguna
                                Brahman] associated with the four bodies, and therefore it is "no-knowledge". So
                                finally, the <i>Vedas</i> have said "neti-neti" ["not this, not this"], meaning
                                it is neither knowledge nor ignorance. Unmoving Supreme Self is the only Truth and
                                only essence. It is without substance and is the root of all that is transient.
                                Samartha Ramdas has expounded upon this conclusion very nicely in <i>Dasbodh</i>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, why is this knowledge unsteady? It is because Final Reality has been given so
                                many names and attributes of masculine, feminine and neuter gender. It is called
                                Satchitananda, Ishwara, Ahamkara, Shesha, Narayana, the Primordial Being, and Shiva,
                                etc. These are some of the masculine names. It is called Shakti, Prakriti, Shruti,
                                Shambavi, Chitkakla, Narayani, etc., and these are some of the feminine names. It
                                is called Nija Rupan [one's own nature], Mahakarana [supra-causal body], Jnana,
                                Brahman, Anandayatnam [Empire of Bliss], etc., and these names are of the neuter
                                gender. These neuter gender names have come to be known as Self-knowledge. One who
                                is not one of these is the steady, immovable essence, the true Reality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though the great quality of the knowledge in the Supra-causal body is much greater
                                in comparison with the knowledge in the gross body, it sill remains "knowledge".
                                One can eliminate certain knowledge through deduction, but as long as there is still
                                a "knower", it means that the aspirant has not yet achieved the Final Reality stage.
                                Final Reality is that stage of knowledge from where no one can return.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Knowledge has been labelled as "knowledge", but Reality has really no name. In the
                                pure knowledge "I am", there is a modification or movement in the form of the world.
                                As the mind changes, that knowledge also changes. Modification is a state or a stage,
                                whereas Reality is beyond all modifications. Thus, there is as much a difference
                                between the pure knowledge "I am" and the Final Reality as there is between darkness
                                and light. Samartha Ramdas says, "Where there is a contact between the steady and
                                unsteady, the intellect is confused." According to this statement, the last misunderstanding
                                or delusion lies here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before the knowledge "I am" dawns, forgetfulness is mistaken for knowledge. In the
                                same way, when true knowledge is underdeveloped, it is mistaken for perfect knowledge
                                ["I am"], which is the last stage of "absence of modification" or Final Reality.
                                And when the aspirant embraces that ["I am"], his progress is arrested here. Samartha
                                Ramdas has compared this type of an undeveloped Self-realised being to a man who
                                is awakened in a dream and thinks he is awake. Yet he is snoring! "You think that
                                this is wakefulness, but your illusion has not yet gone!", is the warning given
                                by Samartha Ramdas to this type of being. That Supra-causal body, in which the gross
                                and subtle bodies are like a dream, is itself like a dream in the pure knowledge
                                "I am". There is bondage in ignorance and liberation in knowledge, but when both
                                ignorance and knowledge are not there, how could the idea of bondage or liberation
                                exist?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <i>Vedas</i> and scriptures talk up to the point of the Supra-causal body. Until
                                then, it is the primary premise or the theory. In the field of knowledge beyond
                                the Supra-causal body is the proven final conclusion [siddhanta], and the cancelling
                                of all that has been laid down is right here. When all phenomena is destroyed or
                                annihilated, whatever remains is your real nature. It is impossible to describe
                                it in words. Where the knowledge of words is proven to be ignorance, where consciousness
                                becomes non-consciousness, and where all remedies recommended by the scriptures
                                are only hindrances, you will see for yourself how you reach that highest point.
                                The Satguru brought you to the threshold and pushed you inside, but the Satguru
                                cannot show you the beauty or the panorama within. You have to seize the treasure,
                                the trophy, yourself. Now, after all this has been said, there remains nothing that
                                can be conveyed through words. Words were used for whatever had to be told. That
                                which cannot be conveyed by words has now been entrusted to you. We can only inspire
                                you to be an aspirant, but you have to become a siddha [liberated being] by yourself.
                                We have reached the end of the exposition. Words are redundant. One thing is clearly
                                enunciated here, and that is "All praises to the Satguru" ["Satguru Bhajana"].
