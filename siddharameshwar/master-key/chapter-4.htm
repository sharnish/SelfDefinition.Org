                                Knowledge
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Up to this point, an explanation of what the four bodies are has been given. Now
                                we will see how the "knowledge" actually dawns on all these four bodies. To attain
                                the knowledge of objects through the gross body with the physical eyes, it is necessary
                                and expected that all the four bodies are there to help. For example, when you look
                                at a mango, or have the knowledge that this is a "mango", see what happens if you
                                see just what the physical eyes alone sees. Does the physical eye also see that
                                object as a "mango"? No, it does not happen like this, therefore behind this physical
                                eye is a subtle eye of intellect whose help has to be sought to know the mango.
                                Even this is not sufficient. If these two bodies have no support of the causal body,
                                then the intellect is dead. The gross causal body is ignorance, which is the idea
                                "I am". This body acts in all these ways, like space, sky, void, distance, and because
                                it acts in all these ways in order that the intellect should work, it needs space
                                in which to act. There is the eye, the intellect, the sky in the form of the casual
                                body [which is ignorance], but if there is no witness in the form of the Supra-causal
                                body to connect all these three together, then there would be no knowledge of anything
                                at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, to attain knowledge of objects, it is obviously necessary that all these four
                                bodies be present. In order to know the changes [vikaras] in the subtle body, there
                                is no necessity of a physical body&mdash;changes like attraction, repulsion, thirst,
                                hunger, stomach pains&mdash;all these can be known, but this knowledge requires
                                the help of the causal and Supra-causal bodies. Now in order that knowledge should
                                dawn on the causal body, the help of the gross and subtle bodies is not required
                                at all. It must have the Supra-causal body's help. For gaining knowledge in the
                                causal body, the subtle body&mdash;which includes the mind, intellect, conscience,
                                pranas and senses &mdash;has absolutely no use. All these only have their sway over
                                the gross and subtle bodies. The field of the causal body is entirely different
                                and no one can ever step into it. Then how can one even enter the Supra-causal body
                                ? The scope of the mind and intellect is only limited to the subtle body, thus they
                                cannot enter the causal and Supra-causal bodies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, the knowledge of the Supra-causal body is absolutely self-sufficient. It expects
                                no help from the other three bodies. This body is self-luminous. Even though the
                                eye sees the objects, no object can see the eye. To see the sun, none feels the
                                need for a lamp. Like this, nobody is capable of seeing the King of knowledge, which
                                is the Eye of the eye. It proves its own existence by its own light or illumination.
                                Even though the eye cannot see itself, anyone who has eyes never doubts whether
                                he has eyes or not. This type of certitude abides in him. Similarly, knowledge gains
                                more knowledge while one witnesses something or someone other than oneself. If we
                                have to see our eye somehow, we have to stand before a mirror and then we can see
                                the eye by witnessing the reflection of the eye. But that knowledge of the eye is
                                only knowledge of the reflection. This knowledge is proving its own existence by
                                witnessing everything other than itself. For the proof of this, no other evidence
                                is required.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This knowledge is all-pervading, and yet it becomes invisible from the point of
                                view of an ignorant being, who takes the gross body as true and everlasting. He
                                is like a poppy seed in the ocean, reducing the Highest to the smallest thing. The
                                ways of the world are indeed perverse! It has become our habit that when we are
                                looking at a small thing, we forget the bigger thing. We ignore a self-proving and
                                self-sufficient thing and we praise an artificial thing. Whatever words of praise
                                we give to a beautiful electric light while looking at it, we never give to the
                                sun. When we look at the pictures painted on the wall we forget the wall itself,
                                and when we look at the wall, we forget the house itself. When we discover objects
                                in the light, we forget the light, and while we are reading letters written on a
                                piece of paper, we are not conscious of the paper at all!

                                The Process
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                In spite of the fact that the pervader is infinitely bigger, when we pay attention
                                to the pervaded object, we forget the pervader. The gross is pervaded by the subtle,
                                the subtle is pervaded by the causal, and even the causal is pervaded by the Supra-causal
                                body. Though this is the case, the Supra-causal body cannot be seen because one's
                                sight is concentrated on the gross. When the narrow outlook of beings widens and
                                becomes like the pervading One, then they will gain the vision of the Truth, that
                                infinite knowledge which can cover the whole sky and even encase it!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The knowledge that abides in the Supra-causal body, though a destroyer of ignorance
                                [causal body], cannot destroy the gross and subtle bodies. Ordinary superficial
                                knowledge gained through the gross and subtle bodies is not the destroyer of ignorance.
                                Only that extraordinary unique knowledge is the opponent to ignorance. For example,
                                the wood contains fir, but the fir does not destroy the wood. So, ignorance is sustained
                                by ordinary knowledge. It is only after achieving the original knowledge that ignorance
                                vanishes, but the function of the gross and subtle bodies does not stop, since the
                                impulses of the gross and subtle bodies continue to impel the Self-realised being
                                [jnani]. Those objects which are not visible in the darkness can be seen when the
                                darkness is destroyed by the light of a lamp. Though the light destroys darkness,
                                it does not destroy the object. Only when the light and the objects remain can you
                                know the objects. Here it is darkness alone that meets with destruction. In the
                                same way, when one attains Self-knowledge, the ignorance is completely eradicated.
                                Only the gross and subtle bodies go on receiving impulses, but does the causal body
                                stop getting impelled? Let us give this point a little thought.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ignorance has many forms. Ignorance, sky, space, point of contact, distance &mdash;
                                all these various forms belong to ignorance. After gaining Self-knowledge [of "I"],
                                all ignorance is destroyed. But in this type of Self-knowledge all these impulses
                                are in the form of gross or subtle desires, so they will not rise at all unless
                                the sky or space is created first. So, when we look back at the sequence in which
                                body after body gets eradicated at each step while trying to attain Self-knowledge
                                &mdash;first there is Self-knowledge ["I am"], then the causal body in the form
                                of sky, then the subtle body, and after that the gross body&mdash;all these readily
                                appear and take form. Even before the impulses of the gross and subtle come, the
                                ignorance in the causal body is destroyed, yet it perforce establishes a step of
                                space between the subtle and Supra-causal bodies.

                                When knowledge gets released from itself and allows another impulse to come within
                                itself which is not its own, the causal body in the form of pure consciousness [chidakash]
                                simultaneously gets created. Then in sequence, the subtle body appears and then
                                the gross body starts to appear. The four steps which we previously climbed in sequence
                                were: 1. gross, 2. subtle, 3. causal, 4. Supra-causal
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, the same sequence has to be reversed: 1. Supra-causal, 2. causal, 3. subtle,
                                4. gross. Knowledge, instead of abiding peacefully within itself, starts stirring.
                                When it starts sliding back down, the latter two steps cannot be stepped upon unless
                                the causal state, in the form of pure consciousness, is stepped upon first. Then
                                the last two steps of the subtle and the gross bodies dawn, and on these steps alone,
                                the appearance of the world is felt.

                                What Has Happened?
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The knowledge of the world's appearance has not been able to destroy ignorance completely.
                                When light destroys darkness, it also gives us knowledge of objects which were not
                                previously known due to the darkness. Similarly, the world appears only because
                                the causal body sustains it in the form of space. At this stage, there will be no
                                knowledge of the gross and subtle bodies as long as the appearance of the world
                                is felt, whether by a wise one or an ignorant one. It must be understood that ignorance
                                is always lurking in some form or other. The difference being that ignorance will
                                not appear in that particular form [of objective knowledge] within the Self-realised
                                being.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unless knowledge dies, ignorance cannot die. Knowledge and ignorance are twins born
                                to this illusion [maya]. Like Siamese twins, they both take birth at the same time
                                and also die at the same time. If one is there, the other also lives on. If one
                                dies, the other also is no more. Since this is the Truth, we will now see how knowledge
                                itself will die. Before the knowledge in the Supra-causal body dies, the bodies
                                that are underneath it must first die in sequence. We will observe this now. When
                                we are looking at a dying man, do we do anything else but keep looking at him? We
                                do not die with him! In the same way, we will calmly see within ourselves how these
                                four bodies die. One principle about death is that when growth stops, dissolution
                                begins. The meaning of this is that whenever a thing stops growing, it starts disintegrating
                                on the path to death until it is fully destroyed. It is not necessary to do any
                                extra work for death. Destruction is inherent in growth. In birth there is death,
                                while in death there is birth. This is the tradition of birth and death. A thing
                                which is born dies its own death. Even though there may be some other factor attributed
                                to death, like a car accident or disease, the root cause of death is nothing other
                                than birth. These four bodies have appeared within pure nature, so they have to
                                die. How do they die? We shall see that now.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The death of the physical gross body, according to the principle "Where there is
                                growth, there is destruction", can never be avoided. If not today, at least after
                                a hundred years it must die. The gross body grows until the age of twenty-five and
                                after that the body starts getting disintegrated and slowly starts walking the highway
                                of death and one day, it becomes a victim of death. As the gross body is only the
                                physical form of the subtle body, it can be said it has no separate independent
                                existence. A tree in the gross form is nothing but the result of its seed, which
                                is the subtle body. The subtle body is the seed of birth and death. This seed does
                                not get destroyed as easily as a tree. Its growth itself is enormous, so that if
                                it is not sought out and destroyed by man's effort, it will keep on growing eternally.
                                Its growth is the cause of the infinite number of gross bodies, and it puts a being
                                through eighty-four million births. When the physical body stops growing, this subtle
                                body does not stop growing and it is here that one feels the need for a Satguru
                                in order to understand how to stop the growth of the subtle body.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To stop the growth of the subtle body of dreams and desires, all desires must be
                                given up. Desires, dreams and worries are the product of the mind. The task of breaking
                                them can be done only through one's own mind. Whatever is created by mind cannot
                                be destroyed by the hand, and whatever is created by hand cannot be destroyed by
                                the mind. When we try to break these dreams and desires by force, their crowd only
                                seems to grow. The mind is flippant when you try to curb it and only gets more agitated.
                                Therefore to stop the growth of this mind, Satguru gives you the remedy by telling
                                you, "If you try to keep quiet, gradually the dreams and desires dissolve." When
                                a small infant is sleeping, you observe its eyes for some time. You will easily
                                learn to stay quiet from watching him. When going to sleep, you will realise how
                                easily the infants slips into sleep, forgetting himself. While you are looking at
                                it, you also slip into the stage of forgetfulness which is without any dreams, desires,
                                worries or doubts. A thorn can be removed from a finger by the trick of using another
                                thorn. The mind can only be broken by the mind. Birth and death, rising and setting
                                are two opposites sides of the same state of consciousness. When one comes the other
                                goes, and when one goes the other comes. Death dies its own death, like Bhasamasura
                                who put his own hand on the own head and destroyed himself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, when the mind is broken, the stage in the form of the causal body or forgetfulness
                                gets completely exposed and the aspirants attains the knowledge of that forgetfulness.
                                Here a doubt might arise again, even if the mind gets broken up after attaining
                                the state of forgetfulness. The mind does not die completely, so what is the remedy
                                for this? The remedy is to go on persistently practising repetition of the mantra
                                given by the Guru. Once the effort of practising to stop the growth of the mind
                                starts, the mind slowly goes along the path of death and is completely annihilated.
                                But the study and the practice has to be equally persistent. Once a tree starts
                                drying up, even if one tries to keep it ever green, after some days a time will
                                come when it gets uprooted, broken up and eventually falls down dead. Even if it
                                is plastered on the top, painted and is repaired again and again, a time comes when
                                it will crumble into pieces. In the same way, if the mind is constantly stopped
                                from growing, it will one day naturally get tired and break up. But the aspirant
                                should not get tired of practising. Thus, the next body lies exposed after death
                                of the subtle body. The curtain or covering of the subtle body gets destroyed and
                                automatically the causal body gets exposed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now let us see how this causal body also comes to die off. The causal body is the
                                producer or father of the subtle body. Whenever any state comes uninvited, it is
                                experienced for a short while, but once the flush of it recedes, it is not even
                                remembered. This state, while coming, is forceful and growing, but once the flood
                                ebbs away it is not even remembered. While getting submerged after a short while,
                                it starts breaking up and at last becomes as if it were not there at all, finally
                                getting absolutely destroyed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When a human being is getting roasted in the hot sun, and comes under the cool shade
                                of a tree, at that very moment the flood of cool peace comes to that being with
                                such force that he utters "Ha! Ha! Ha!" with joy and shows that flood of peace overflowing
                                from inside and outside of him. However, after some time, that "Ha! Ha! Ha!" passes
                                automatically and he lies quietly unaware of his surroundings. Thus, when the hustle
                                and struggle of the subtle body comparatively becomes less, the forgetfulness in
                                the form of peaceful void of the causal body is indeed instantly forgotten. When
                                this negative state is negated, it results only in negation. To kill it, it does
                                not require a sword of a positive state of "I am". Samartha Ramdas has made this
                                clear by saying, "The negative is negated by its own negation." Thus, when the state
                                of forgetfulness is dissolved, the highest state of consciousness and knowledge
                                [Turiyavastha} immediately becomes exposed. This state of knowledge comes to a being
                                who is still related to ignorance. But even this Supra-causal state, though it grows
                                to be powerful, starts dissolving later on. When one attains knowledge, it is necessary
                                that the knowledge itself dissolves. One which comes has to go. As ignorance comes,
                                knowledge comes. Thus, when the Supra-causal body dies, the ultimate Reality [Parabrahman],
                                who is immanent in all four bodies, gets exposed, and this being is never born and
                                never ever dies. After each and every body dies, the one who sees the death of all
                                these bodies, He remains&mdash;That is your real nature.

                                The Four Castes
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Lord Krishna has said in the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>, "I have created four types of
                                castes [varnas]." This can be a subject of experience for any human being in his
                                own Self. "My creation is divided into four parts&mdash;Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya
                                and Shudra&mdash;and these parts are divided according to their quality and karma."
                                These four bodies or castes are divided on the same basis. The Supra-causal body
                                is of the Brahmana caste, the causal body is of the Kshatriya caste, the subtle
                                body is of the Vaishya caste, and the gross body is of the Shudra caste. In the
                                same way, the Paramatman contains these four separate parts within itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The gross body is heavy and an instrument of service and labour, therefore its caste
                                is Shudra. Sitting on a mattress at a place in the gross body, taking a balance
                                in hand and managing the business of the whole world, this intellect comparing things
                                as good and bad, big and small, employing the gross body as a servant, gets things
                                done as he likes because he is the master. For this reason, this trader received
                                the epithet Vaishya.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now look at at the brave action of the causal body! This causal body establishes
                                his kingdom by swallowing up the whole wealth in the form of the world. This world
                                was accumulated on the strength of the capital desires, dreams and doubts. The causal
                                body swallows up the servants in the form of the gross and subtle bodies!! This
                                causality which is one of total destruction is the attitude of Kshatriya, and therefore
                                the causal body is that state of Kshatriya.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now what still remains is the Supra-causal body. In this body there is complete
                                neglect for each of the three other bodies&mdash;"I have nothing to do with the
                                gross body, which puts in hard labour and dies. Neither have I anything to do with
                                the Vaishya in the form of of the intellect, which trades in ideas and dreams and
                                spreads a big panorama of the world. I also have nothing to do with the Kshatriya
                                in the form of the causal body, who sits quietly as if nothing has happened after
                                killing both the subtle and gross bodies. They may all do anything&mdash;may the
                                gross body groan under hard labour, may the subtle body do business with the world,
                                and may the causal body wage a war against these two&mdash;but what have I to do
                                with all of this?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just think of Ram and let the world fight. Knowing this very well, the Supra-causal
                                body goes on announcing the Vedic words, "Aham Brahmasmi" and sits quietly on his
                                own ground. That Supra-causal body has reached the high stage of Brahmanhood [Brahmana]
                                and is very orthodox about the touch of another caste. It cannot tolerate the touch
                                of any other body. The other bodies hold the Supra-causal body in high esteem and
                                smear their heads with the dust of his feet. From the point of perfect knowledge
                                [vijnana], even if this Supra-causal body becomes polluted, it is still the most
                                sacred and highest in all the three worlds.

                                Swarga, Mrityu and Patala Worlds
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The gross body is the Swarga world, the subtle body is the Mrityu world, the causal
                                body is the Patala world, and the Supra-causal body is the Brahmana world. All these
                                bodies are divided according to their qualities and these worlds are known by these
                                qualities. The gross body is the Swarga world [heavenly world] and it is on top
                                of all the worlds. It is in this world that all sorts of external enjoyments are
                                experienced. The wonderful gardens and beautiful forests are created for this world
                                only. The presiding deity is Brahma Deva [the creator], whose main quality is activity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The world below the Swarga world is the Mrityu world. This is a big factory of birth
                                and death, where the qualities of appearing and disappearing are continuously being
                                processed. This continuous process of birth and death is nothing else but the rising
                                and setting of mental modifications. The rise of one mental modification is birth,
                                and when it sets it is death. In this way, we are born so many times and die so
                                many times during the same day. Everyone is conscious of their innumerable births
                                and rebirths. Every idea produces a visible appearance and when that sets, the appearance
                                also sets. In this way, it is the end of an era [kalpanta] when an idea stops. This
                                is experienced continuously in the subtle body. The writers of the scriptures have
                                accepted the principle of creation and appearance. They have stated that as soon
                                as an idea rises, the world rises, and when the idea sets, the worlds sets. Unless
                                this subtle body in the form of the Mrityu world is permanently destroyed and buried,
                                hundreds of eras are sure to rise and set. Therefore, one should die such a death
                                that eliminates the further necessity of being born at all, and live in one's own
                                true nature in such a way that there is no fear of any further dying experience.
                                Let this be so. Whatever has to happen will happen, but until then, it is certain
                                that this Mrityu world keeps its mouth wide open for entry! The abode of the subtle
                                body is the inner sense, which is known as the antahkarana or the "seat of consciousness".
                                The presiding deity is known as Vishnu, who nourishes the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now the world below this is the Patala world, which is the causal body in the form
                                of forgetfulness. In the Patala world there is pitch darkness of ignorance and therefore
                                Mahesh the destroyer, who has the quality of darkness, is the presiding deity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Above all these three worlds is the Supra-causal body, which is the highest and
                                is therefore higher than the three worlds. Here, the presiding deity that rules
                                is pure and true knowledge, which is the God of all gods. All the worlds are produced
                                from this very God, which is called "Trailokyanatha" [the Lord of of the three worlds].
                                Brahmana&mdash;the basic knowledge "I am"&mdash;is the Guru of all the other castes
                                and is therefore most highly placed amongst them. This gives him the status of a
                                master. He does not allow even the shadow of ignorance to fall on him, and what
                                is more, he even refuses to get polluted by the mind and intellect. So, give up
                                even the idea that he will ever embrace the corpse of the gross body. This orthodox,
                                clean Brahmana in the form of pure universal consciousness does not allow a single
                                entrant into his Supra-causal body&mdash;Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra cannot enter
                                his house. The gross and subtle bodies can never enter the Supra-causal body. But
                                the other castes cannot do anything without the help of Brahmana. All their good
                                and bad actions or works are sustained by the strength and support of Brahmana.
                                At this time, Brahmana leaves his dwelling and accomplishes the work of these three
                                other castes, and as soon as the work has been completed, he cleans himself up right
                                in front of their doorstep, and only then re-enters his own dwelling.

                                This Brahmana is rich with knowledge and that is why he is called "Vedo Narayana".
                                He knows all three tenses&mdash;the beginning, middle and end&mdash;and he has the
                                characteristic of sandhya, the junction point of any two ideas. He is worshipped
                                by everyone and therefore he is also called "Bhudeva"&mdash;"Lord of the earth".
                                Everyone from every caste and creed worship this God [the Reality], whether they
                                are aware of it or not. The worshipper may be a hindu, a muslim, a christian, a
                                jain, a parsi or a buddhist, or he may be from Iran, Turkey, etc., yet he worships
                                this God, whoever he may be. He cannot help it. When this God is hungry, all types
                                of food and drink are offered to him as an oblation. There are mattresses with cushions
                                ready for him to sleep upon. If God feels like travelling, there are cars, aeroplanes
                                and carriages ready for him. To supply him with fragrant garlands, many trees and
                                creepers blossom forth with bunches of flowers. All the servants and attendants
                                are ready to obey him with folded hands. Wife, children, palaces are all for his
                                entertainment and they are all his dwellings. God, as Self, dwells in the innermost
                                heart of one and all beings and all kinds of services are rendered to him. In spite
                                of this, beings consider their body as God and offer all their services to it. Ignorant
                                people have accepted the wrong idea and have misunderstood the whole thing. So,
                                what is there to be amazed about?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All those who are doing any action, are doing it for nothing else but the Reality.
                                The Mahadeva is constantly enjoying the shower of all the objects of the senses,
                                through the five instruments of action and knowledge&mdash;sound, sight, touch,
                                taste and smell. That devotee is indeed glorious who has understood the secret of
                                this Mahadeva. All natural acts of such a devotee are dedicated to God-Reality.
                                The bees, birds, insects, and even the ants are performing worship to Reality, but
                                they do not understand this because they have no intellect, so they cannot be blamed.
                                But how unfortunate it is that even an intelligent human being should not understand
                                that all his daily and occasional actions are for the sake of this God alone! Really
                                how unfortunately it is!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This God-Reality is the same as a "king of knowledge" who, while swallowing a mouthful
                                of food, tastes and enjoys it. It is he who discriminates between fragrance and
                                stench, who understands which sound is pleasant or harsh to the ear, who observes
                                the difference between a beautiful, a fierce or an ugly form, and who understands
                                the hard of soft touch of a thing. He is always present, reigning Supreme in every
                                being's Heart. How utterly misguided is this idea that we worship any other God
                                than Reality!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just think which God they worship when christians worship their Christ, hindus worship
                                their Vishnu, parsis worship their Zoraster, or buddhist worship their Buddha? Are
                                they not worshipping merely the corpse of the above gods? But what is the feeling
                                of the devotee who is worshipping? Ask anyone from any religion to describe their
                                God. They will never say, "My God is all conscious, all light, solid, omniscient,
                                omnipresent, omnipotent, he activates all, owns all and is without birth or death."
                                Will anyone say that his God is a stone, a rock, mud, metal, heavy, dull, vacant
                                without consciousness, weak, blind or deaf?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From this it is clear that whether it is Christ, Vishnu, Zoraster or Buddha, whichever
                                God it may be, his nature is full of consciousness and his qualities are Godly.
                                If anyone really possesses all these qualities then this indicates that he is the
                                Absolute [Paramatman]. Universal Reality [Vasudeva] is of the form of knowledge
                                which is present in everybody's heart. He alone dwells in all things. The hearts
                                of Mohammed and Christ are pervaded by him. It is through this Reality and nothing
                                else that the quality of Vishnu as the protector is sustained. Any devotee whosoever
                                he may be who worships any God, that worship is the worship of this innermost one
                                Self. The obedience made to all the other gods go to this God-Reality alone. This
                                is the absolute Truth. The forms of all the above mentioned gods are only temples
                                of this one Reality. All the names belong to his temples. He is present in the innermost
                                regions of all the forms. He sits in all the forms of beings and accepts worship
                                from all of them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whichever actions are being done by your gross body, whatever dreams, desires or
                                doubts have crossed your mind, all these happen for the sake of Reality, in order
                                to please him. If you recognise this much, then your work is done. Everyone is doing
                                something through their body and mind. If you say, "I do not want to do it anymore",
                                still you cannot stop yourself from doing it. But whatever you do, the doer and
                                the enjoyer of all your deeds is only Reality. This fact alone must be recognised
                                in every movement.
                            </p>

                                All the auspicious and inauspicious acts thus become dedicated to Self-Reality and
                                the aspirant remains absolutely free. This is what is called "jnana yajna", or sacrifice
                                through knowledge. "When you come and go, speak with your mouth or swallow a mouthful,
                                when you give and take, stand or sit, do any action at home or outside, or enjoy
                                sex in bed, reject all shame and think only of God." It is explained in this verse
                                how one knowledge alone is playing at each point. To contemplate this means to contemplate
                                Reality. The body consciousness has to be turned into Self-consciousness. The decision
                                taken that Self is doing all alone is the state of liberation. This is the advice
                                given by Samartha Ramdas. Even Tukaram asked for this gift from God, so that "I
                                may never forget you." Likewise, we too must never forget the Self. Then surely
                                salvation is at your feet! As this rope in the form of mind is twisted in the direction
                                of body consciousness, it must be guided by the intellect and directed towards the
                                Self, in which it gets absorbed. When this rope is twisted in the opposite direction
                                of Self-consciousness, it unwinds completely, leaving the strings which form it
                                to blow away in the wind. In the end, there will be no remaining rope worth its
                                name at all! As a screw is screwed in, only when it is turned in the opposite direction
                                will it come out. In this manner, if the mind is guided by the intellect in the
                                opposite direction towards the Self, it gets absorbed in Self. Similarly, a mind
                                directed towards Rama gets absorbed in Rama. Afterwards, there is nothing left in
                                the form of mind, inside or outside, because it becomes one with Self, one with
                                Rama. An aspirant will see this for himself.

                                To understand better how the one pure knowledge is playing, go out of the house
                                and at once look at the moon. With what speed the pure consciousness rushes out
                                to the moon out of the window and how it pervades the whole sky in a fraction of
                                a second. Experience this! Has the mind this much speed? How could it be? The mind
                                has received this much speed only through the help of knowledge. Wherever the mind
                                goes, consciousness is already present there. What wonder then that the movement
                                of the mind gets stuck in this consciousness? You only have to open your eyelids
                                and instantly the pure knowledge of consciousness pervades the whole sky, the spectre
                                of stars and the moon disc! Instead of saying that it pervades, it is better to
                                say it has already pervaded the whole, but comes to be experienced as new. When
                                consciousness travels from the eye to the moon and knows it to be the moon, that
                                is objective knowledge. In this example, the moon is the object and consciousness
                                takes its shape the moment the moon is known. If there is a cloud in front of the
                                moon, then consciousness takes the shape of the cloud and views it as an object.
                                Thus, it pervades the cloud and knows the cloud as an object.
