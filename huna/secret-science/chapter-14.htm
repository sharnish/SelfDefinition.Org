								Complexes, Fixations
							</h4>
							<p>
								What the doctors and psychologists have failed to see clearly is the rather startling
								fact that the subconscious or low self is not the only one afflicted with fixations
								of ideas &ndash; the complex.
							</p>
							<p>
								Freud, Jung, Adler &ndash; all of them fixed their attention on the subconscious,
								not realizing that the conscious self had similar and equally dangerous fixes.
							</p>
							<p>
								The astounding truth is that almost all persons have conscious beliefs or opinions
								which are fully as fixed as are those of the low self. For instance, take some outstanding
								examples which will be instantly familiar to all of us. There is the person who
								is set in some political belief. He has passed beyond all appeals to common sense
								and logic in his rabid belief that his political party is right and all others are
								wrong. He will not listen to any argument against his convictions. Any effort to
								point to parts of his belief that are wrong will be met with anger and loud resentment.
							</p>
							<p>
								A similar example can be found in any of the millions who have accepted a religion,
								and who close their minds entirely against any possible change of their opinion.
								New facts, new findings, or new circumstances make not the slightest impression
								on these individuals. They have developed a complexed set of beliefs or opinions
								which are shared by both low and middle self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here is another secret from the lore of the kahunas: if you wish to know whether
								a person has a complexed belief which is shared by his low self, watch to see whether
								the emotions react to any suggestion that the beliefs might be less than correct.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you say to a Republican, "I think the Republicans are making a mistake about
								last week's legislation," and if you are met with an emotional reaction instead
								of a quiet consideration of the reasons you may go on to give for your opinion,
								there is a complex behind the political beliefs of the man.
							</p>
							<p>
								Criticize a man's religion and watch in the same way for the nature of the reaction.
								The low self is the only one responsible for emotional reactions. The middle self
								reacts only with logic and reasoning unless it is entangled with the low self in
								holding complexed views, in which case reason fails to begin to function as emotions
								flare.
							</p>
							<p>
								A man's political complexes, fortunately, seldom react on his health. His religious
								fixations frequently cause endless illness and misfortune.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas knew what the psychoanalyst has overlooked to a painful extent. It is
								the fact that when a man has "sinned" and his low and middle self agrees that he
								has sinned, the low self may have a fixed idea that punishment must be given for
								sin. If this is the case, the low self may set about punishing the man through illness
								or accidents.
							</p>
							<p>
								The point can be illustrated by the case reported by a psychoanalyst, of a young
								man who had been brought up by an aunt who had given him a very strict religious
								training. As he finished high school he felt the urge to take up the ministry, but
								gave up the idea to take a job in a furniture factory. In the factory the paint
								and varnish fumes sickened him. He was sent to the wood working department, and
								the sawdust gave him asthma. He got another job and then another. In every case
								he was made ill by something connected with the job.
							</p>
							<p>
								He chanced to fall into the hands of a doctor who recognized the symptoms as the
								indications of a deep-seated complex. His original complex had been formed when
								he had given up the idea of devoting his life to religious service in the ministry.
								The low self had shared with the middle self a deep sense of guilt for refusing
								to give his life to the service of God. Because it was painful to think of the refusal,
								the young man had shut away the memory of it. But that memory had remained in the
								low self as a part of the fixation of guilt.
							</p>
							<p>
								As he had been taught that all sins and guilts are punished by God, his low self
								had expected and feared punishment. However, as the middle self refused to think
								about the sin of refusing to go into the ministry, the low self did what is known
								as "translating" or changing the externals of the complex. It hid its anxiety to
								have the man become a minister behind a dislike that amounted to illness for every
								other occupation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The doctor, after the usual questioning and observation period, dug out the cause
								of the trouble, but instead of being able to point out the source of the fixation
								and so rationalize and drain it off, he met a new obstacle. When the young man was
								forced to recall his refusal to enter the ministry, he was still convinced that
								he had been guilty before God of a great sin of omission.
							</p>
							<p>
								The doctor tried to argue with him and met a blank wall. The patient would not listen
								to reason. He became angry and insisted on denouncing himself. In the end he was
								advised to enter the ministry to regain his health. He did as advised and his illnesses
								vanished.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this case the complex was not removed. It could not be removed in the ordinary
								way because it was held by low and middle selves alike. Reason could not get a hearing.
								The only remedy was to let him act in such a way that he would obey the dictates
								of the dual fixation.
							</p>
							<p>
								In his report, the doctor showed his failure to recognize the complex as a part
								of the conscious mind of the patient. He wrote: "... although the fixation was at
								last brought to light and submitted to the usual process of rationalization, it
								became evident that it had not been removed. Upon making a visit to the furniture
								factory where the first symptoms developed, the smell of paint and of wood sandings
								sickened him in turn. Recovery came only after the fixation was accepted as immutable
								and a school for ministers was entered."
							</p>
							<p>
								The urgency of the need for better understanding of the single and dual complex
								and the ways to combat them may be realized when one considers the dire fact that
								one out of every family of six will eventually need treatment on this score. Unfortunately
								the present methods of treatment are far inferior to those formerly used by the
								kahunas. The most effective method is "deep analysis," but this takes months of
								time and mints of money. If a cursory review of the case and a small amount of treatment
								by suggestion does not bring a cure, the patient has an alarming chance of joining
								the throngs which crowd the hospitals for the insane.
							</p>
							<p>
								A complex of simple nature or a dual one shared by both selves, if not allowed to
								have its way, creates a "house divided against itself" which certainly will fall
								&ndash; into insanity, or chronic invalidism.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Edward S. Cowles, <sup>[1]</sup> famous for his "soul clinics," said a few years
								ago that he was certain that the mental conflicts caused by fixations were the direct
								cause of the steady lowering of "nerve energy" which, if continued, ended in disaster.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cowles">en.wikipedia.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />Edward_Cowles</a>
								]
							</p>
							<p>
								He explained that if the usual supply of nerve energy or vital force falls slightly
								below normal, the individual begins to feel a lack of spirit and cheerfulness. This
								turns to a feeling of depression. Further depletion results in melancholia, and
								there come the progressive symptoms as depletion continues: deeper states of depression,
								hysteria, fear, nervous breakdown, mania, and psychosis. The dismal fringe of insanity
								is touched. If one continues to sink lower, exhaustion brings helpless insanity
								in which reason is lost and memory vanishes. In this condition the patient lies
								inert and must be artificially fed.
							</p>
							<p>
								It might be added that during the gradual depletion, there is always the danger
								that a poltergeist type of low self which has been separated from its middle self,
								may drive out the selves of the ailing body and obsess it. In these cases there
								is a return of physical energy but, with the original low self deposed, memories
								are gone, and with the original middle self gone, all reason is lacking.
							</p>
							<p>
								With violent death so frequent in the two World Wars, it is inevitable that there
								are more of these ghostly low self spirits of the poltergeist class abroad awaiting
								a chance to seize a body and obsess it. We continually read articles calling attention
								to the alarming increase of insanity. At the present rate of increase, some estimate,
								we shall in a few years have so many insane that there will not be enough sane people
								to feed and care for them.
							</p>
							<p>
								In self defense we need to learn what methods were successfully used by the kahunas
								to combat the complex in its single and dual form, and to treat the unfortunate
								victims of obsession. For the moment let us take up the first part of the problem:

								<span class="block">Case 25:</span> Kahunas Treat Illness Caused by Dual and Single
								Complexes
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								Because modern psychology is so young and so little advanced, it offered little
								help when I tried to understand the significance of the things the kahunas did in
								treating patients to remove complexes. Their success proved to me that they had
								a very superior method, but from a close study of what they did, I was unable to
								learn what action of mind they used or what force was employed, both of these things
								being invisible and silent in operation. Only from the externals of treatment and
								ritual could I draw conclusions. Much later I was able to see what actually took
								place.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Cases: [A and B]</h5>
							<p>
								(A) There was a driver of "rent" cars in Hawaii in 1926, a handsome, healthy and
								charming Hawaiian. He had been brought up by a very religious father and had married
								a very religious wife. He attended church faithfully.
							</p>
							<p>
								A few years after his marriage he fell violently in love with another woman, even
								though he remained devoted to his wife. He was much afflicted by his conscience,
								and greatly oppressed by a sense of guilt for having sinned. His wife discovered
								his infidelity but, after a stormy scene, forgave him on his promise that he would
								not repeat his offense.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, before a year had passed, he had again fallen by the wayside. This time
								he was not found out, but his sense of guilt was greater than before.
							</p>
							<p>
								At this time he happened to catch cold. The cold took on the symptoms of influenza,
								and despite excellent medical care and nursing, he failed to recover. On the contrary,
								he gradually became weaker and weaker. He lost interest in his surroundings, refused
								food, and turned his face resolutely to the wall.
							</p>
							<p>
								His wife, after hearing the verdict of the doctor that he could not live more than
								another day or two, called in one of the few remaining kahunas who were at work
								in Honolulu at that late date.
							</p>
							<p>
								The old kahuna listened carefully to the wife's account of what the white doctor
								had said. He asked a few questions, and then began his treatment. He bared the body
								of the sick man and began to rub him slowly.
							</p>
							<p>
								&nbsp;From time to time he paused and rubbed his own hands slowly together, then
								applied them to the sick man's back, chest or head, always telling in a low voice
								how he was pouring strength into the patient to make him strong.
							</p>
							<p>
								After a time he began questioning the man, asking what he might have done that had
								hurt someone &ndash; had been a sin. At first he was met by a stubborn refusal to
								answer, but finally the sin was blurted out. After making his confession the patient
								asked to be let alone to die in peace.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahuna, however, reasoned gently. He called in the wife who had been sent to
								prepare a hot tea of native ti leaves, and told her very simply that her husband
								had sinned against her and was dying because he could not face her. The wife was
								enraged for a moment, but facing the danger of death to her husband, agreed to forgive
								once more. She kissed him and wept over him, then went back to her kitchen.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahuna, following a very ancient ritual, produced from the bundle which he had
								brought with him, four small white stones. He placed one of these at each corner
								of the bed, commanding them to act as a wall to keep away any spirit who might come
								to try to interfere with the treatment. Next he took sea water and a brush of green
								leaves, sprinkling the room while he ordered all unwelcome spirits to leave the
								place.
							</p>
							<p>
								The wife brought the decoction of ti leaves boiled in salted water, and it was diluted
								with cold water in a calabash bowl. Taking a brush of the green sword-like ti leaves,
								the kahuna approached the patient, telling him that because his wife, who had been
								sinned against, had forgiven him, his sins could now be washed away with the water
								in the bowl. Describing carefully the way the sins were being dissolved in the water
								and being washed away, he sprinkled the patient's body, then brushed vigorously
								with the leaves, getting some water back into the bowl. He declared that all the
								sins had now been washed away and had entered the water remaining in the bowl. He
								asked the wife to raise the patient's head so he could see with his own eyes that
								the water carrying the sins was poured on the ground outside the door and so was
								disposed of forever.
							</p>
							<p>
								The patient was carefully dried and rubbed, being told that his strength was rapidly
								returning and that he would soon be very hungry, would eat, and then sleep. Upon
								awakening he was promised that he would be well on the way to recovery. The man's
								strength did return, he did eat, and he fell asleep. When he awakened hours later,
								he sat up and called for more food. His wife brought thick soup and he was sitting
								up happily talking with her when the white doctor called. He was one long in the
								Islands and experienced. After a careful examination of his patient he turned to
								the wife and asked, "You had the other kind of doctor?" She nodded, and he went
								out shaking his head wonderingly.
							</p>
							<p>
								(B) A white woman, young and lately married to an officer of the Marines, was my
								neighbor during part of my years in Honolulu. Before her marriage she was a very
								staid Methodist, looking upon dancing as a sin and considering drinking a very grave
								sin indeed. Her husband introduced her into a circle where dancing and drinking
								were the order of the day. She was laughingly pressed to join the fun, and gradually
								threw off her reluctance and began to learn to dance, even taking a cocktail. She
								had learned to dance a little when, during a dance at the home of a friend, she
								tripped over a rug and twisted her ankle. The twist was slight and she continued
								dancing. But the next day the ankle remained slightly sprained. It did not get well
								as she had expected that it would, and in a week or so became worse. She went to
								a doctor, who examined the ankle and made X-ray pictures, finding nothing to explain
								the failure to recover. In a short time she could hardly walk. Then there developed
								a strange, deep running sore below the ankle joint. The doctor called in a consultant.
								It seemed very puzzling. All treatment failed. It was then that the young woman
								came to me to ask my opinion as to whether the kahunas &ndash; of whom she had heard
								me speak &ndash; might be able to help her. I advised her to try one, and she did.
							</p>
							<p>
								This kahuna was a younger man and more worldly wise if less expert than older healers
								might have been. He at once suspected a complex &ndash; or, as they say, "something
								eating inside." He asked what sins she had been committing, and she at once confessed
								dancing and drinking, telling him of her former church affiliations.
							</p>
							<p>
								With great patience he set to work to explain to her the kahuna point of view regarding
								sin of all kinds. The kahunas had a very simple way to tell what was a sin and what
								was not. One asked oneself whether any act was such that it injured another or hurt
								another's feelings. If it hurt no one in any way, that act was not a sin. He pointed
								out to her the logic of the kahuna belief that God was too high and all-powerful
								for any human being to hurt by any act. Little by little he convinced her that dancing
								and the taking of a cocktail were not really sins. This done, he performed a ritual
								of forgiveness of sin, sprinkling her bare arms and face with salt water and declaring
								that all her guilts of every sort had been forgiven and washed away. He then carefully
								massaged the bad ankle, telling her over and over that it was now becoming healed.
								He bound the ankle in a poultice of native herbs and told her to repeat frequently
								to herself, aloud: "I cannot sin against God. I am too small. I have been forgiven
								for all my sins. I have hurt no one. My ankle is getting well very fast."
							</p>
							<p>
								The success of the kahuna's treatment became apparent in a short time. The running
								sore closed and healed with hardly a scar. The ankle recovered its full strength
								and flexibility.
							</p>
							<p>
								Not realizing the fact that the trouble had been caused by a state of mind which
								had been altered by changing her attitude toward dancing and drinking, the young
								woman failed to obey the kahuna's orders to continue her affirmation of "No hurt,
								no sin." Again she danced a little and drank a little. As habits of thought are
								as easily reestablished as, for instance, habits of smoking or using alcohol to
								excess, her two selves gradually slipped back to the old beliefs. She found herself
								worrying for fear the kahuna had been wrong and her religious instructions of childhood
								right.
							</p>
							<p>
								One morning, to her dismay, she found that the sore had reopened. Going back to
								the kahuna, she asked him to heal her anew, but when he had questioned her, he refused.
								He explained that when an old habit of thought, "an eating inside," had been awakened
								after once having been removed, it was almost impossible to remove it a second time.
								In the end the ankle was operated on by doctors, bone cut away, and it is to be
								supposed, enough pain suffered to convince her low self that she had made amends
								for her sins. She gave up dancing and cocktails, and the sore did not return.

							<h5>
								Comment:</h5>
							<p>
								In the two cases given above, the important thing to note and to remember is that
								the middle self can share a complex with the low self.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Case "A" the Hawaiian had sinned by being unfaithful to his wife. No form of
								forgiveness could have convinced him that he had not so sinned. To convince his
								reasoning middle self that he had been forgiven, his wife had actually to forgive.
								He had to see her and hear her speak the words of forgiveness &ndash; these being
								physical stimuli which could and did impress the low self which had accepted or
								brought on illness as a punishment for the sin. While this case does not deal with
								a deep-seated and hidden complex, it illustrates very well the common cause of illness
								based on strong fixed beliefs which have their origin in actual facts, and which
								are shared by both low and middle selves.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas taught that nothing is a sin if it does not hurt someone. This is a
								truth which must be shouted from the housetops endlessly if we are to escape the
								ill effects of the teaching that it is a sin to break dogmatic taboos of various
								religions. There is no way of knowing how many thousands of cases of illness, insanity
								and disaster have been caused by complexed religious beliefs developed in childhood,
								such as the belief of the young woman in Case "B" that dancing and drinking were
								sins.
							</p>
							<p>
								The sex urges are the most prolific sources of complexed ideas of sin with which
								we have to contend, since as children we are taught modesty and are shamed or punished
								for any display of sex interest. Religious instruction implants the idea that sex
								urges are sinful and that, therefore, children are born from and in sin.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas were logical in their approach to sex. If sex acts did not hurt another,
								they were not considered sins. In any case such acts were not sins against Higher
								Beings. Sins were only acts that hurt others.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Emmanuel [?!] Freud, discoverer in the West of the subconscious or low self,
								found that in treating illness by suggestion, the subconscious would not accept
								suggestion in many cases. His search for the reason for this brought to light the
								complex of ideas which can be held by the low self. It was found that the low self,
								which is the one which accepts suggestion, will reject suggestions which are contrary
								to its fixed beliefs in morals or its complexed belief in some imaginary condition.
							</p>
							<p>
								Later on it was discovered that the low self, if thwarted in acting in accordance
								with a complexed belief, would "translate" that complex or change it so that it
								seemed to have little connection with the first and important complex.
							</p>
							<p>
								There was the case of the small boy who developed a complexed dislike for attending
								church. He may have been forced to attend church when ill, weak or otherwise indisposed.
								(He may have been punished for not wishing to attend church and so given a shock
								complex.) The boy loved his parents, and when they explained why he must go to church
								to worship, and begged him to be a good boy and do as he was told, he tried to obey.
								He tried to love church, as he had been instructed, and seemed properly convinced
								that it was his religious duty to attend services. However, the low self, which
								had become complexed with dislike for attending church, showed the animal-like craftiness
								so well known to psychologists and the kahunas of old. It translated its fixed determination
								not to go to church into a major dislike for the smell of incense. Upon smelling
								incense, the boy would invariably be sick and have to be rushed from the church.
								The situation then became one in which the child was willing enough to go to church,
								but could not. The low self had its way.
							</p>
							<p>
								In complexes built upon sex restraints, the low self may translate the externals
								of the complex several times. The result of such action is that even the long psychoanalytical
								study of the patient's dreams and thought associations may fail to bring to light
								the original complex so that it can be talked over and submitted to "rationalization"
								&ndash; being thus "drained off" or brought under the control of the middle self
								as are normal thoughts and ideas.
							</p>
							<p>
								Freud decided that all complexes were based on sex frustrations. Later psychologists
								modified the severity of this decision, but there is still a school of psychologists
								who hold with Freud and present very telling arguments to support his stand.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because the complexed low self will refuse to accept suggestion to remove the symptoms
								of trouble caused by the complex, the healing value of suggestion is greatly lessened.
								In Case "B" the low self of the young woman would have refused healing suggestion
								after the complex had been restored in the second breaking out of the ankle sore.
								Low selves refuse to accept any hypnotic suggestion that is contrary to the subject's
								moral beliefs. A hypnotist cannot force a subject to perform acts which he considers
								immoral.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because the low self creates all of the emotions for us, it is possible in many
								instances to discover the presence of a complex or fixation by watching for an emotional
								reaction when such a complex is stirred into action.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are accustomed to the spectacle of someone "flying into a blind rage" over some
								trivial happening. It may be only a word. These small things that touch off emotional
								explosions are the "triggers," so to speak. Once the trigger has been touched, the
								full force of all former rages connected with the circumstance that created the
								complex in the first place is released.
							</p>
							<p>
								On the other hand, there are good complexes and their triggers. One may have many
								complexes developed in connection with his daily occupations. For example, the alarm
								clock rings, and even against our desires, we stir and begin to follow our habitual
								actions of arising.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the ways in which the low self forces its wishes on the middle self is through
								engulfing the middle self with a great wave of emotion &ndash; in which it usually
								is caught and overpowered. Waves of hate or of desire or of distaste are well known,
								as are those of homesickness and longing. Of all the emotions, love is the most
								interesting to study. It seems to be the one which the middle self can most nearly
								share. Basic physical attraction may be added to by elements of parental or filial
