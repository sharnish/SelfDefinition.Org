								Huna is Applied Psychology
							</h4>
							<p>
								Before beginning the explanation of how fire-walking and other magic is performed
								through the use of three invisible elements which are still almost unknown in modern
								psychology, a few things need to be told about the religious beliefs of the kahunas.
							</p>
							<p>
								The "Secret," or body of information handed down from one magician to another, was
								what may be called applied psychology for the most part. The element of religion
								was very small, especially if we accept the technical definitions of religion in
								the best modern sense.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Paul Tillich, <sup>[1]</sup> Professor of Philosophical Theology at Union Theological
								Seminary writes, "Magic is a special kind of interrelation between finite powers;
								religion is the human relation to the infinite power and value. ... Magic is the
								exercise of imminent power, religion is the subjection to the transcendent power."
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich">en.wikipedia.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />Paul_Tillich</a>
								]
							</p>
							<p>
								All religions are mixed with magic. Prayer is magic. Everything we do to gain benefits
								for ourselves in this life or the next is a part of magic. Magic is getting something
								from supernormal sources. Religion is worship of a Supreme Being and an acceptance
								of whatever It gives us, whether pleasant or unpleasant.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the kahunas got from the common source of such tales &ndash; the Nile Valley
								and neighboring lands &ndash; the stories of Adam and Eve, the Creation, the Flood
								and so on, and brought those tales with them to Polynesia, they did not share the
								concept of a personal and patriarchal God.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas taught that the human mind is not capable of understanding a form of
								consciousness unlike and superior to its own; therefore, all human efforts to imagine
								the characteristics of a final, ultimate and supreme God were a waste of time. They
								believed that there must be some Ultimate Creative Source, but they did not pray
								to It.
							</p>
							<p>
								Take a flower, for example. It can have but a vague idea (if any) of the cow in
								the pasture. The cow can have a very vague idea of the nature and motives of the
								herder. The herder, therefore, when he has decided that there must be a Supreme
								Being who created the universe, can picture It only as another man. Although he
								cannot picture this Great Man except in the vaguest terms, he fears Him, prays to
								Him in hope of receiving favors, tries to bribe Him with sacrifices or sacrificial
								austerities, tries to obey such commands as he imagines this Supreme Man has laid
								down, and, last, worships him.
							</p>
							<p>
								In a like manner, the invisible world of spirits and spiritual beings is to us much
								as our world is to a fish in the sea. The fish is hardly aware of a world above
								his watery realm. But as we ascend in the scale of intelligence,<span lang="en-gb">
								</span>we of the realm of earth and air can know and understand the fish in his
								depths, even while remaining unable to share those depths as a place in which to
								live.

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="levels-of-consciousness">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4 class="top-h4">
								Levels of Consciousness
							</h4>
							<p>
								The kahunas, while supposing that there were levels above levels of consciousness
								above man, as there are levels below him, paid scant heed to any level other than
								the one directly above our own. On this level existed the thing we would call the
								superconscious part of mind. They called it by various names, one of which, the
								favorite, was Aumakua. This translates, "Older, parental, utterly trustworthy spirit."
							</p>
							<p>
								As it takes two to be a "parent," the Aumakua was considered to be a spirit composed
								of a male and female pair. All prayers and rites were addressed to this dual spirit,
								but because it was considered as much a part of ourselves as the conscious or subconscious
								is to the modern way of thinking, the Parental Spirit was worshiped not at all -
								it was LOVED. No sacrifices were made to it. No bribes were offered. It laid no
								commands on the lower selves. The relation was one of mutual love and trust &ndash;
								the parent and child relation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Very logically, the kahunas taught that if any prayers to still Higher Beings were
								necessary, the Parental Spirit would know when they were needed and how to make
								them, doing for us such things as we are unable to do for ourselves because we have
								minds of a lower level of ability.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because of this common sense attitude the kahunas remained simple and free from
								man-made dogmas to a surprising degree. They were direct and to the point. They
								could afford to be, for they possessed a system that actually WORKED. A workable
								system leaves little room for vagueness and dogmatic speculation.
							</p>
							<p>
								This practical system by which magic was performed left no unfilled needs of a philosophical
								nature for the kahunas. They had, therefore, no saviors, no salvation, no heaven
								or hell, and no revealed religion with books in which were written, "Thus said God
								..." In very fact, they had no books. Their language was never written until modern
								times.
							</p>
							<p>
								While few of us may ever wish to fire-walk, this ancient rite is of great importance
								because it is a clear demonstration of the fact that there is a magical power that
								may be called into action if we know the methods to use.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most of us pray for blessings of various kinds. The lore of the "Secret" brings
								definite and immediate results much superior to those we get. We cannot pray for
								fire-immunity and get it. Need more be said of the value to us of a study of the
								ancient lore?

							<h4 class="top-h4">
								Basic Nature of Magic
							</h4>
							<p>
								Dr. Brigham, it will be recalled, had analyzed the basic nature of magic before
								understanding it. He had told me to watch for (1) a form of consciousness which
								used (2) some form of force, and (3) manipulated that force through some invisible
								kind of physical matter.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Aumakua or superconscious part of mind is the consciousness involved in giving
								fire-immunity. The force it uses in this work is called mana by the kahunas, and
								is known to us as vital force. It is electrical in its nature and shows strong magnetic
								qualities. The invisible substance through which the vital force acts is called
								aka, or "shadowy body stuff."
							</p>
							<p>
								As we already know that there is such a thing as vital force, let me begin my presentation
								of Huna (the "Secret") by pointing out some of the things already known about the
								uses and nature of this force, and then go on to things better known and explained
								by the kahunas.
							</p>
							<p>
								It will be seen that the kahuna explanations also cover much that has been unexplained
								in the field of Psychical Research.
							</p>
							<p>
								The three elements, consciousness, force and invisible matter, give us three measuring
								sticks with which to measure all magic. Notice how they apply more and more to magic
								as we come to see it unfold.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 7: (Mixed)</span> The Three Invisibles Behind Magic
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								In order to present a detailed and clear picture of the materials under discussion,
								I will cite some well known types of psychic phenomena, beginning with table tipping.
							</p>
							<p>
								When we place our hands on a table and tip it, that is like a dog wagging its tail.
								When we place our hands on a table and some invisible being tips it, or when the
								table lifts or levitates from the floor with all hands on its top, that is the tail
								wagging the dog. However, when the table or other objects move of their own accord
								with no hands near them, the homely simile fails and we are face to face with one
								or the other of two forms of consciousness which may be involved in magic.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first form of these two forms of consciousness is the ordinary "ghost." If it
								makes noises and bangs things around in a senseless or childish way, it is what
								the Germans called a <i>poltergeist</i> or "noisy ghost." But if the moving is done
								as if by a reasoning and adult ghost, it is normal <i>psychic phenomena.</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								The second form of consciousness is that of a super-conscious type of being. Its
								work is characterized by the changing of an object into an invisible form before
								moving it &ndash; perhaps moving it many miles. This type of movement will be discussed
								later on. At present we are dealing mainly with the FORCE used to cause the movement.

								The Cases [A through C]:

							<p>
								The bulk of the cases which I shall cite in my report, unless it is specifically
								stated that they come from other sources, will have been drawn from the <em>Encyclopaedia
									of Psychic Science,</em> a monumental and authoritative book by Dr. Nandor Fodor
								<sup>[2]</sup> who, with his staff, collected and digested all available reports
								and accounts relating to psychic phenomena during the hundred years prior to 1933.

								to side, occasionally going so far as to tilt up at one end or at one side; and

								<p>
									"The instances in which heavy bodies, such as tables, chairs, sofas, etc., have
									been moved, when the medium was not touching them are very numerous. I will briefly
									mention a few of the most striking. My own chair has been twisted partly around,
									whilst my feet were off the floor. A chair was seen by all present to move slowly
									up to the table from a far corner, when all were watching it; on another occasion
									an armchair moved to where we were sitting, and then moved slowly back again (a
									distance of about three feet) at my request. On three successive evenings, a small
									table moved slowly across the room, under conditions which I had specially prearranged,
									so as to answer any objection which might be raised to the evidence."

							<p>
								(C) Cesar Lombroso, <sup>[6]</sup> the famous Italian psychiatrist and criminal

								<p>
									"I went into the cellar, at first in complete darkness, and heard a noise of broken
									glasses and bottles rolled at my feet. The bottles were ranged in six compartments,
									one above another. In the middle was a rough table on which I had six lighted candles
									placed, supposing that the spirit phenomena would cease in the bright<span lang="en-gb">
									</span>light. But, on the contrary, I saw three empty bottles, standing on the ground,
									roll as though pushed by a finger, and break near the table. To obviate any trick,
									I felt and carefully examined by the light of a candle all the full bottles which
									were on the racks, and assured myself that there was no cord or string that could
									explain their movements. After a few minutes, first two, then four, then two other
									bottles on the second and third racks detached themselves and fell to the ground,
									not suddenly but as though carried by someone; and after their descent, rather than
									fall, six of them broke on the wet floor, already soaked with wine; only two remained
									whole. Then at the moment of leaving the cellar, just as I was going out, I heard
									another bottle break."

								Comment:
							</h5>
							<p>
								Comment on the above cases, as well as on all cases which will later be cited, will
								fall into three parts. First we shall have to consider what is known in the modern
								world relative to such cases. Second, we shall have to consider what the lore of
								the kahunas may add to the information. And third, we shall have to weigh all evidence
								as best we can (in this period prior to exhaustive experimental work) and make our
								guesses &ndash; do our speculating.
							</p>
							<p>
								While no effort will be made to divide comment into these three parts, the reader
								will do well to remember that there are these three very important methods of approach
								to the fascinating problems which confront us.
							</p>
							<p>
								As there is nothing to be learned and nothing to be gained from those who still
								elect to deny all the phenomena around which this investigation revolves, no time
								will be wasted in argument unless there is some valid objection which must be noted
								for its possible significance.
							</p>
							<p>
								Modern explanations of table tipping and the movement of objects by unseen agencies
								have not improved on the classical one that the spirits of the deceased, or similar
								disembodied spirits, are responsible for all the phenomena.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas heartily agree that spirits are responsible, but give added information
								as to the nature and classification of such spirits.
							</p>
							<p>
								Efforts have been made to explain these mysterious occurrences without falling back
								on the spirit hypothesis. These efforts will bear consideration for the reason that
								they represent the alternative that we may accept if we discard the idea of spirits.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Nandor Fodor, in his <em>Encyclopaedia of Psychic Science,</em> writes: "Exteriorisation
								of motricity was postulated in the case of Eusapia Paladino (noted medium) by Morselli,
								Flournoy, Geley and Carrington."
							</p>
							<p>
								This "motricity" is thought to be a combination of electricity and vital force or
								nervous energy. It is postulated that this force, whatever it is, can leave the
								body and enter the object which shows movement. (This covers the first unit of our
								kahuna measuring stick, that of the force or power involved. The second unit is
								the intelligence involved to put the force to use in moving the objects, and the
								third is the invisible substance used as a hand to let the force act upon the moving
								objects.)
							</p>
							<p>
								The intelligence which causes the movement of the various objects is supposed to
								have the ability to cause this motricity or force to come out of the body of a living
								person and cause the movement. The intelligence is also credited with the ability
								to draw invisible (sometimes slightly visible and slightly tangible) substance from
								the living body of a mediumistic person (or sitters at a seance) and make from it
								a hand or other limb through which to use the force. This substance is called "ectoplasm."
							</p>
							<p>
								A different explanation is to be found in the postulation that the intelligence
								is the subconscious part of mind of the living medium, and that it, under certain
								mysterious conditions, can cause the motricity to leave the body together with ectoplasmic
								substance, and then cause objects to move. The subconscious is said to be causing
								this activity for the reason that, were the conscious mind at work, the medium would
								certainly be aware of the activity and in control of it.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the bulky literature which has grown up around psychic phenomena and spiritualism
								during the century just past, scattered postulations are to be found covering the
								possible part magnetism may have in the action of motricity on objects. This is
								a most exciting and promising line of thought and, because of the unexplored territory
								which it still surrounds, it is recommended to the reader as a fine place to begin
								working with a view to helping to forward the general investigation of magic.
							</p>
							<p>
								We suppose that gravity is akin to magnetism, and that magnetism is to be found
								where there is a current of an electrical nature. There might be something of a
								push-and-pull nature involved in the movement of tables and other objects.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas recognized the magnetic and the opposite, repulsive, nature of vital
								force or motricity but, unfortunately, they left no detailed exposition of the subject.
								They knew the force as a thing which had to do with all thought processes and bodily
								activity. It was the essence of life itself. The kahuna symbol for this force was
								water. Water flows, so does the vital force. Water fills things. So does the vital
								force. Water may leak away &ndash; so may vital force.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Brigham spent a considerable time studying the ancient kahuna practice of holding
								heavy wooden sticks in the hands and, by an effort of mind, causing bodily electricity
								to enter a stick and charge it heavily.
							</p>
							<p>
								These sticks were formerly used in battle, the kahunas standing in the rear lines,
								charging large sticks, and then throwing them at one of the enemy. Upon contact
								with the sticks, even the strongest warriors were often made unconscious.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Brigham had tested the power of such sticks, and had found them capable of giving
								what seemed to be an electric shock of a peculiar kind. The shock numbed the limb
								which was touched and made the head swim. It was recalled that the American Indians
								had a similar knowledge and practice. (They were also fire-handlers and some are
								today.) An early account in the government archives tells how a medicine man exhibited
								his magic power by touching a strong brave on the chest with a forefinger, knocking
								him to the ground in an unconscious condition.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the chance of an element of hypnotic suggestion being mixed in such performances
								must not be overlooked, it would seem that there is a very definite shocking power
								to be found in excess accumulations of vital force. The part played by the mind
								and will in causing such an accumulation, either in a throwing stick or a forefinger,
								as above mentioned, seems very important.

							<h4>
								W.R. Stewart
							</h4>
							<p>
								W. R. Stewart, <sup>[7]</sup> during his preliminary training under the Berber kahuna,
								was told that vital force could be stored in wood, stone, water and the human body,
								also in the invisible body of a "ghost." This force could be expended suddenly and
								thus move very heavy objects.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[7. From <em>Huna Bulletin</em> on this site: "One reader was W. R. Stewart, retired
								newspaper correspondent, living In England. He had been engaged in his youth in
								an effort to learn native magic from an isolated Berber tribe in the Atlas Mountains
								in North Africa. ... The words used in naming the elements in the Berber version
								of the system ... upon comparison to similar Hawaiian words proved to be identical
								except for slight changes which may be ascribed to differences in dialect." <a href="/huna/huna-bulletin/part-1.htm">
									/huna/huna-bulletin/part-1.htm</a>&nbsp;]
							</p>
							<p>
								A demonstration of the magnetic nature of the force and of an intelligence or spirit
								of a sub-human or off-human level was made by Lucchi for Stewart's benefit at night
								and on a hillside where a large stone was covered by wooden doors resembling cellar
								doors. These doors were pulled up, and they descended steps cut into the soil. The
								rock projected from the end of the cellar-like cave at the bottom. By torchlight
								a hen was killed and its blood allowed to fall on the face of the stone. An invocation
								was spoken addressed to the spirit supposed to reside in the stone at times. The
								hen was then dropped on the ground before the stone, but it soon rose in the air
								and pressed against the stone. A moment later Stewart, who had approached closer
								and held his torch down to have a better look, felt a powerful magnetic pull which
								almost jerked him forward against the rock. He was caught and pulled back with some
								effort by Lucchi, who immediately insisted that they leave.
							</p>
							<p>
								Stewart never learned what intelligence had been invoked or for what such invocations
								were used in the course of daily magical practice. His guess was that the spirit
								which had made its presence known in the rock was a "nature spirit" and that it
								had something to do with the soil or the pasturage or weather &ndash; all very important
								to the Berbers and their herds. It was his private opinion that this spirit and
								its powers were inimical to man and probably dangerous to any but a skilled kahuna.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lucchi had made the statement that all dealings with such spirits must follow a
								carefully observed ritual, and that any change in the ritual might cause trouble.
								Stewart had changed the usual course of the rite by stepping close to the rock at
								the wrong time. He was told that he should have stood back until all the life force
								in the hen had been absorbed by the spirit &ndash; the latter needing it to use
								in complying with the requests made in the invocation, after which the body of the
								fowl would have dropped. Stewart was reminded of the many tales of jinn or nature
								demons current in Arab folklore.

								If some types of movement of objects by unseen forces could be proved to be largely
								dependent on the magnetic pull or push of electrovital force, we should have made
								a discovery of the first magnitude. The conclusion might be two-fold, (1) that the
								force could push or pull objects here and there without guidance from any spirit,
								living subconscious mind or other intelligence; (2) that the force could act without
								visible or invisible substance to serve as a hand, or even without invisible ectoplasmic
								substance to use &ndash; but, with some etheric matter, perhaps, through which to
								move in wave form. (The theory of the ethers is still controversial.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today Science gives us ether to fill void space and interpenetrate full space, and
								tomorrow takes it away from us.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Magnets pull iron objects to them, and in turn are pulled toward the objects. If
								a magnet were placed on a shingle in a tub of water, and a nail placed on a second
								shingle quite near, the magnetic pull would cause both shingles to drift closer
								together. In other words, one shingle would not remain stationary while the other
								was pulled.
							</p>
							<p>
								Animal magnetism or vital force is amazing in that it displays a pull on the nail,
								but no balancing pull on the magnet, so to speak. Mr. Arthur Spray, a cobbler near
								London, well known to a friend of mine, is a powerful hypnotist. In his book, The
								<em>Mysterious Cobbler,</em> <sup>[8]</sup> he tells of a most intriguing &ndash;
								and entirely inexplicable &ndash; phenomenon which he has frequently met in his
								practice as a hypnotic healer.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">

							</p>
							<p>
								He demonstrated this phenomenon before a group of newspaper correspondents on one
								notable occasion. Taking a young man who was a good subject, he had him lie at full
								length on the floor, then placed him in a deep hypnotic sleep in which his body
								became rigid. Then, standing at the feet of the prone subject, he ordered him to
								open his eyes. When the eyes opened and looked up at him, he began beckoning with
								his right hand. Slowly the head and shoulders of the subject rose of their own accord
								into the air, the heels remaining on the floor. Inch by inch the rigid body lifted
								at the head until it stood suspended at a right angle a good four feet from the
								carpet. It was held there for a few seconds, then the beckoning of the hand was
								reversed and the body slowly descended to the floor.
							</p>
							<p>
								During this experiment, Spray felt no pull on his body or hand. While the young
								man weighed over one hundred and forty pounds, Spray did not feel the need of lifting
								an ounce to cause him to rise.
							</p>
							<p>
								This experiment has been duplicated by other hypnotists, so we may accept the evidence
								of a one-sided pulling nature in human magnetism. (Which seems to result from an
								accumulation of electrovital force charges &ndash; these charges being built up
								through some physical action set in motion by the willed command.)

								Baron Eugene Ferson [Fersen]
							</h4>
							<p>
								Baron Eugene Ferson [Fersen] <sup>[9]</sup> demonstrated this one-sided magnetic
								pull in Honolulu several years ago before large class groups. He believed that by
								making a mental command he could draw from the atmosphere an electrical force. There
								was no doubt that he did draw force from some source, and his pupils readily learned
								the knack of the process.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[9. Fascinating bio: <a href="https://www.scienceofbeing.com/eugene-fersen">https://www.<wbr />scienceofbeing.com/<wbr />eugene-fersen</a>&nbsp;]
							</p>
							<p>
								Under his instruction, one pupil would make the mental command to himself to accumulate
								a surcharge of force. When satisfied that such a surcharge had been attracted (probably
								generated in the body from oxidization of foods) the charged pupil would place his
								hands on the shoulders of an uncharged pupil, then draw them slowly away. If the
								surcharge was sufficient, the uncharged pupil would be pulled strongly after the
								hands as they were removed. However, there was no sense of pull on the hands of
								the surcharged pupil.
							</p>
							<p>
								I once saw Baron Ferson demonstrate the peculiarity of this form of magnetism by
								placing his hand on a light folding chair which stood in a row of similar chairs
								against a wall. He willed the magnetism to leave his body and enter the chair. He
								then called a sensitive young woman from the next room and asked her to walk along
								the row of chairs. She did so, and as she came opposite the magnetized chair she
								was almost violently pulled down upon it. The young lady weighed at least ten times
								as much as the chair, and one might naturally expect the chair to rise and press
								itself against her body. But the action was just the opposite. The rule seems to
								be that the object &ndash; regardless of its size or weight &ndash; which has the
								heavier charge of vito-magnetic force pulls to it the less charged object, feeling
								no corresponding pull on itself as a reaction.
							</p>
							<p>
								This magnetic force acts over a space of several feet and through such obstacles
								as cement walls. Baron Ferson, after charging himself, took his place on one side
								of a ten-inch cement wall while his class stood in an arched opening where both
								sides of the wall could be seen. On the opposite side of the wall the sensitive
								young lady (found to be the most sensitive of the class to the magnetic pull) was
								placed, her back three feet from the wall, and with a man stationed on either side
								to hold her by the arms to keep her from being pulled too violently against the
								wall by the magnetic force exerted by Baron Ferson. Ferson raised his arms and stretched
								them toward the girl on the other side of the wall. Instantly she was so powerfully
								pulled that the men had to exert all their strength to keep her from touching the
								wall. Ferson, on the other hand, stood with heels together, very erect, and neither
								felt a pull nor showed even a slight sway in the girl's direction.
							</p>
							<p>
								The part that suggestion might play in such a demonstration was discussed by members
								of the class, and to test the magnetic pull without the possible implication of
								suggestion, the pulling effect was tried by two of w on a small bull terrier. Dogs
								are not known to be suggestible. We went through the prescribed exercise of accumulating
								extra force, then placed our charged hands on the rump of the dog which was made
								to stand before us, head pointed away. Both the owner of the dog and myself were
								successful in exerting such a pull on the dog that it was drawn backwards several
								inches, despite its clawing at the rug to resist. We, in our turns, felt no pull
								at all on our hands or bodies.

								The more one considers the strange action of mind in conjunction with what seems
								undoubtedly to be vital force, the more easily one can believe in the various phases
								of magic. For all our proud scientific advancement, we must admit that we are still
								darkly ignorant when it comes to the secrets of mind, vital forces, and invisible
								substances.
							</p>
							<p>
								Down the long centuries there have been current legendary accounts of human flight
								through the air. The witches were supposed to travel magically to their meetings.
								The Greek gods flew through the air at will. The adepts of India and Tibet have
								been said to overcome gravity and float off through the air to distant places in
								the twinkling of an eye. Or, they simply fade out in one land and reappear in another.
								Polynesian folklore is replete with tales of such travels.
							</p>
							<p>
								In modern Psychical Research there are numerous instances in which men have been
								lifted bodily into the air. The famous medium, D. D. Home, <sup>[11]</sup> floated
								horizontally out of the window of one room and back into the house through the open
								window of an adjoining room &ndash; this on the third floor of the building.

								If mind has a certain control over matter, it is probably that the control is exerted
								in some way by means of directing the action of vital force, and through it, the
								action of magnetism or even gravity. A number of experiments have been carried on
								in which breathing and will were used in combination to affect gravity.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Hereward Carrington, <sup>[12]</sup> dean of all psychical researchers, in his
								book, <em>The Story of Psychic Science</em> <sup>[13]</sup> tells of his experiments
								with the lifting game, in which four people stand ready to lift a fifth with the
								fingers. All five inhale deeply several times, then hold the breath and make the
								lift. The person lifted feels lighter than usual. When this game was played on platform
								scales, the normal combined weight of the five people and a chair was 712 pounds.
								At the moment of the lifting the scales registered a loss of weight from 50 to 60
								pounds respectively in several tests.

								Baron Schrenck N&ouml;tzing <sup>[14]</sup> recorded a case in which a young man

								The other side of this picture is more obscure, but numerous reports have it that
								individuals have been able, through the use of will and breathing control, to increase
								their weight greatly.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Hawaii (as in Tibet, according to a fairly recent book) there was used a combination
								of will-breathing to gain magical aid in running long distances. There were specially
								trained messengers who sometimes held races of sorts. In carrying messages for the
								high chiefs, their speed and endurance surpassed by far that of men not able to
								use this form of magic.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another angle of this problem of vital force and its strange motor and magnetic
								phases awaits exploration. This is the healing power. From time immemorial there
								has been the practice of the laying on of hands to cure the ailing. It was always
								apparent that some people had more of this healing power than others. Kings were
								supposed to have it as their natural right.
							</p>
							<p>
								In religion, prayer accompanies the laying on of hands. In kahuna practice amongst
								the Berbers, W. R. Stewart describes cases of immediate relief from pain when his
								teacher laid her hands on the sick. She told him that her magical force was so strong
								that it left her body and went into the sick one through the simple process of touching
								with the hands. In more serious cases she said she would make a ritual prayer and
								take time to ready the patient with psychological and ritual cleansings.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Hawaii the transfer of vital force from the kahuna to his patient, or to the
								spirits of the dead for special ends, was common.
							</p>
							<p>
								Baron Ferson told in his Honolulu classes of a peculiar effect which he had noted
								frequently when placing his hands on another for healing or other reasons. There
								seemed to be a return flow of negative force. This negative return flow carried
								substances with it, such as alcohol and nicotine. Ferson told of having accumulated
								an excess charge of the force (he called it "The Universal Life Force") then placing
								his hands on the shoulders of an intoxicated man, with the amazing result that he
								himself became intoxicated to a degree, while the drunk man became almost entirely
								sober within a few moments.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mediums at spiritualistic seances have reported such a strong transfer of nicotine
								from heavy smokers in the circle (hands joined to cause the flow) that they suffered
								all the symptoms of nicotine poisoning. With heavy smokers removed from the circle,
								the symptoms failed to appear at later sittings.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have watched natural healers lay hands on the sick, making at the same time suggestions
								that they are drawing out the poisons and illnesses with strokes of their hands,
								and were shaking these off their hands (making gestures as of shaking water from
								finger tips). Nearly all such healers are convinced that they actually do draw invisible
								substances from the sick. Most of them, after finishing their treatment, wash their
								hands and arms in water, suggesting that they are cleansing themselves of any of
								the harmful invisible substances drawn from the patient.
							</p>
							<p>
								From my personal observations and studies of this method of healing, I have become
								convinced that almost any healthy person can help the sick by laying hands on them
								and making a willed command that his force enter the patients and strengthen them.
								The use of the will, if accompanied by the spoken word, forms a suggestion which
								may be highly effective.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mesmer, <sup>[15]</sup> who discovered mesmerism over a century ago, was not aware
								of the potency of suggestion in connection with a transfer of what he called "animal
								magnetism." However, he had practiced accumulating a surcharge of vital force (while
								holding a magnet from which he thought he was getting the force) until he was highly
								proficient &ndash; if we are to believe the accounts of what he was able to do with
								the charges of force. He demonstrated healing powers so well that he became famous.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[15. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Mesmer">en.wikipedia.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />Franz_Mesmer</a>
								]
							</p>
							<p>
								At first he laid his hands on his patients directly. Later, when there were too
								many patients for individual treatment, he made the willed effort to transfer his
								force to tubs of water from which iron rods extended. The tubs of water once charged,
								the patients then approached and grasped the rods. The descriptions of the effect
								on the patients leave no doubt but that mesmerism was a working force. Patients
								reacted differently. Some did not react and Mesmer would touch these, usually getting
								the reaction. There was much healing, and much hysteria such as may be caused by
								light hypnotic suggestion.
							</p>
							<p>
								The sudden transfer of vital force from throwing sticks must be kept in mind in
								following this line of thought, also the sudden stunning discharge demonstrated
								when the American Indian medicine man touched a brave with a forefinger and caused
								him to lose consciousness at the touch.
							</p>
							<p>
								Hypnotists, after the advent of mesmerism, found that hypnotism could be practiced
								by suggestion, or even by having the patient gaze at a bright point of light. They
								claimed that no magnetism was needed and none transferred to the patient or subject.
								This seems to be a mistaken idea. The fact that a hypnotic reaction is expected
								of the patient is in itself a suggestion. The fact that the hypnotist is near can
								account for a transfer of a sufficient amount of the vital force to make the suggestion
								take effect.
							</p>
							<p>
								Later on we shall look into the kahuna explanation of how the vital force can travel
								between people without actual physical contact (or between the living and the spirits
								of the dead). At the moment it is necessary only to call attention to the fact that
								there is such an exchange, and that what we learned from Phineas Quimby <sup>[16, 17]</sup>
								to call "absent treatment" is an apparent reality, thanks to the ability to send
								over a distance both the vital force and the healing suggestion.
