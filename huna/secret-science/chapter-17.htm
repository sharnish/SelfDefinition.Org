								A Third and Higher Self
							</h4>
							<p>
								The Secret within the larger Secret was the fact that there was a third self connected
								with man and his two lower selves. The nature of this High Self (Aumakua) and the
								means of gaining its aid also belonged to the inner Secret.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this the kahunas were very far ahead in their findings. They knew that they could
								never do more than guess at the fact of, or nature of Beings higher in the scale
								of consciousness than the High Selves.
							</p>
							<p>
								Their guess was a traditional one. They guessed that the Higher Beings would be
								similar to the lower ones which they knew in man. They subscribed to the ancient
								axiom "As above, so below." They may have originated it, for no other psycho-religionists
								seemed to have had definite and detailed knowledge of the three separate and independent
								spirits which compose the man.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas knew man to be a triune being &ndash; one of three spirits &ndash; so
								they guessed that the gods and even the final highest and SUPREME BEING would be
								triune in nature. This idea may have originated with the kahunas or it may not,
								but it spread around the world and appears in Christianity and Brahmanism if not
								in the lore of the Great Spirit of the Amerindians.
							</p>
							<p>
								Wherever the symbol of the triangle appears, it is safe to say that the secret of
								the triune nature of man and possibly of the gods was incorporated in the religion
								of the people. True, the real meaning of the three sides of the triangle representing
								the three selves of man, may have been lost or misunderstood, but the symbol was
								retained and revered. In Egypt the pyramids presented to the world four faces of
								triangular form. In Central America the triangle was known and used in religion.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another ancient and widespread belief which was common to the kahunas and later
								religionists was that there had been a descent into physical matter of some of the
								CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIGHER BEINGS. This accounted for the creation of the earth and
								lower forms of life and gave rise to various versions of the "FALL" which are met
								in several religions. As a logical result of a belief in a "fall," there followed
								the belief that all lower creatures, headed by man, were on their way back up the
								scale, slowly returning to Ultimate God.
							</p>
							<p>
								Religions are filled with the intricacies of the descent and ascent, but because
								of his mental limitations, man of the middle self level can never do more than speculate.
								The ways of the High Self are unfathomable in a large part, and the ways of still
								higher beings are totally unfathomable. The various scriptures which have been supposed
								to have been given mankind by divine revelation, show in the things revealed the
								inventions of the middle self mind. No two of the revealed writings agree. THE ONLY
								THING OF WHICH WE CAN BE FAIRLY CERTAIN IS THAT THERE IS A HIGH SELF which can be
								approached to get aid in the problems of daily living.
							</p>
							<p>
								In nearly all religions may be found some of the beliefs of the kahunas, even if
								warped to uselessness and stretched to fantastic lengths.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas knew that the spirits of man come back at least once to be born again
								in physical bodies. The low self comes back to be born as a middle self in another
								human body. Some spirits may return to be born again several times in a physical
								body, but the idea of endless incarnations of man as a single spirit in innumerable
								bodies is an example of stretching an original idea to absurd lengths. In Christianity
								and in the teaching of the Jews, Mohammedans and American Indians the idea of reincarnation
								is found only in vague reminders. In the latest of the "revealed" religions, that
								based on the new Oahspe Bible, <sup>[1]</sup> no doctrine of reincarnation is to
								be found.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahspe:_A_New_Bible">en.wikipedia.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />Oahspe:_A_New_Bible</a>
								]
							</p>
							<p>
								The same may be said in a way about the doctrine of Karma which has become such
								a millstone around the necks of religionists in India. The original idea seems to
								have been that when we hurt others we laid ourselves open to spirit attack, or we
								formed guilt complexes and because of them were cut off from direct contact with
								our own High Selves &ndash; resulting in various difficulties.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Hindu idea of Karma resulted from stretching the simple original conception,
								even more than the reincarnation idea. With some logic it was taught that the "Law
								of Karma" began to function in the level of consciousness just below God-the-Unmanifest.
							</p>
							<p>
								All beings lower than this Supreme had to be governed by the Law. To complete the
								logic of this absurd guess at conditions in such unthinkable levels of consciousness,
								the "Lords of Karma" were invented to execute the fine justice. They had to have
								endless helpers to watch each sentient being in the lower heavens and on earth to
								record his good and bad deeds. The records had to be written, and the writing demanded
								a book, which was invented in the form of invisible akasha where all records were
								kept and all things recorded to the last tick of time.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Lords of Karma, as could be plainly seen, did not punish the wicked in the same
								incarnation in which the wickedness was performed. The wicked flourished very often
								as the green bay tree. This flaw in the scheme was covered up by inventing the idea
								that punishment was administered in some later incarnation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The same idea of an ideal and absolutely balanced divine form of justice is to be
								found in the Old Testament, but no attempt was made to cover with reincarnation
								the flaw of the flourishing wicked man. Punishment in hell was fully as effective
								and made a fine contrast with the idea of a heaven for the good after death.

							<h5>
								Christianity
							</h5>
							<p>
								In Christianity we find many things which did not come as a direct teaching of Jesus,
								and the origin of which is lost. The idea of the Lords of Karma is replaced by St.
								Peter as the keeper of the gate of Heaven, and by the Book of Life in which, in
								some indefinite manner, the angel recorders keep a record of each life.
							</p>
							<p>
								Christianity is the nearest to the original kahuna lore of any of the great religions.
								In the rituals of the Church of Rome &ndash; the origin of the rituals being unknown
								&ndash; we find the counterparts of the kahuna rituals used in healing.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas required a confession and used water which had been charged with vital
								force as a physical stimulus to accompany the spoken word of suggestion to "forgive"
								a patient or break down a guilt complex after amends for hurts to others had been
								made. In the Roman Church, after confession, holy water is used in the ritual of
								forgiveness with the spoken words of forgiveness, but the part played by both complex
								and suggestion has long since been forgotten. The penance done at the order of the
								priest before the rite of absolution or forgiveness is, however, quite in line with
								the older rite as a good physical stimulus, even if there are sins to be forgiven
								which do not consist of hurt to others.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahuna methods of exorcising obsessing or haunting spirits is still to be seen
								in a way in the rites of exorcism of the Church.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahuna belief in the High Self or Aumakua is well preserved in Christianity.
								Jesus, according to the records as they appear in the New Testament, prayed to his
								Father in Heaven when he wished divine aid in performing miracles. That is what
								the kahunas did, only with a method of praying in which there was more ritualistic
								action because of the various elements involved. In instructing his disciples, Jesus
								is reported as saying that they should also pray to the Divine Father, but stressed
								the fact that the prayer should be made in His name. This would be logical only
								if Jesus looked upon himself as a High Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								In any event, the matter is not one that will make the slightest difference in using
								a form of prayer to the High Self in obtaining aid in healing. Fire-walking is performed
								with the aid of the High Self, and that aid is obtained by men of a surprising variety
								of religions &ndash; none of whom, oddly enough, is Christian.
							</p>
							<p>
								In India there is a hint in the Bhagavad Gita at the fact of the three spirits of
								man, but the High Self of the kahunas is confused with the "spirit of the Supreme,"
								which is of an entirely different level. (Judge translation, page 57: "Those who
								rest in me, knowing me to be the Adhibh&ucirc;ta, the Adhidaivata, and the Adhiyaj&ntilde;a,
								know me at the time of death.") Because it is considered the duty of each person
								to suffer and so live down his bad karma, no prayers are made by the majority of
								Hindus to gain aid from the Higher Beings in the matter of meeting the problems
								of daily life.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Christianity there is a curious and almost unique mechanism to be seen in the
								vicarious atonement for sins. This doctrine is obscure in its origin, but closely
								resembles the kahuna belief that one can be forgiven for sins instead of suffering
								under a hard and fast law of karma to repay to the last iota. Jesus made the final
								and complete atonement for the sins of the world by his death on the cross, according
								to Christian beliefs. These sins of the world seem to include the sins of the newly
								born babes who are "born in sin" &ndash; a strange dogma at best. The Christian
								does not necessarily have to make restitution or amends in kind. In fact, he could
								not in case he had taken the name of God in vain, for his words could not be recalled.
								Logically, he would have to suffer in hell after death to make amends, but, according
								to the Christian plan of salvation, he may repent and get forgiveness from a priest
								or, better yet, by direct prayer appeal to God in the name of the great atoner,
								Jesus.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas, to repeat once more, knowing that the Higher Beings cannot be injured
								by the living man and so cannot be sinned against, recognize no such sin as that
								of using profanity. The one recognized sin is to hurt a fellow human being. For
								such a hurt amends must be made to the one hurt. In no other way can the evil-doer
								convince himself that he has balanced his account and is no longer guilty of that
								standard sin. If not convinced that he is no longer guilty, his guilt fixation held
								by his low self cannot be removed by the ritual cleansing or kala &ndash; forgiveness
								or restoration of the symbolic Light.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this matter of forgiving the sin in Christianity and removing the guilt complex
								in the kahuna system, there is one point of great significance which must not be
								overlooked. It is the fact that the Christian believes that his sins are against
								God as well as against man, and that he must get forgiveness from God, even if not
								from those he has injured. In the kahuna practice, the Higher Being is not asked
								for forgiveness. It seems to have been taken for granted that the sinner had to
								make amends and bring about his own forgiveness by appealing to the one he had injured.
								This is startling in its logic to the average Christian to whom it has never occurred
								that the one and only place to get forgiven is from the individual sinned against.
								Under the kahuna system, the rational is seen of the Jewish and karmic demand for
								exact and full repayment for sins, with no evasion through repentance or vicarious
								atonement. However, the kahuna system is kept down to the size of the sin itself
								and is not expanded to include gods whose existence and nature are things at which
								we can only guess.
							</p>
							<p>
								It will be seen that the Huna system was definite and detailed, logical, and right
								to the point. It was simple and satisfactory because of a fuller knowledge of the
								complex and the low self which harbors the complex.

							<h5>
								Low, Middle and High Self
							</h5>
							<p>
								Another angle of the atonement for sin is to be seen in the part played by sin in
								preventing normal contact between the low self and the High Self of one guilty of
								a sin. Since the kahunas held that one cannot injure the High Self in any way, and
								that the High Self has no part in cutting off the line of contact between itself
								and the low self, it follows that the low self, because of its sense of guilt which
								it shares with the middle self, feels shame and is like a naughty child which avoids
								the presence of its parents because of its sense of guilt and shame.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is thought that the low self has no sense of right and wrong of its own, being
								an animal self still. It gets whatever idea it has in such matters from the middle
								self, whose reasoning power makes it possible for it to know right from wrong. Because
								the low self is taught to accept blindly the decision of the middle self as to the
								right and wrong of any and all actions, it tends to develop fixations of guilt in
								a rather surprising fashion.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once a decision is reached as to the right or wrong of an action by the middle self,
								and that decision is given as a thought form to the low self for safe keeping, the
								fixation process is almost automatic. This is because the low self has been present
								and has sensed the solid physical action which caused the hurt to the one injured.
								This is a physical stimulus of a solid tangible kind and when it has been observed
								by the low self, it has the effect of fixing the guilt sense immediately, rendering
								it a complex of much gravity. To drain off this complex it is necessary to convince
								the middle self that amends have been made before there can be hope of getting the
								low self to let go of its fixed belief.
							</p>
							<p>
								If a Christian or other religionist believes that he can sin against God, and perform
								harmless acts which he believes to be sins, such as the failure to attend mass or
								the use of profanity, the fixation is not so important for the reason that it has
								not been accompanied by such a direct physical stimulus. In such cases a vague and
								general method of making amends is found in fasting and other forms of self denial.
								As such things are excellent physical stimuli, they work well indeed in clearing
								up the lesser guilt fixations caused by the breaking of dogmatic religious commands.
								It is for a very good and practical reason that fasting and prayer have continued
								down the years to be the most used rite of all in seeking forgiveness for sins.
							</p>
							<p>
								The sins of omission are generally the ones treated through fasting and other powerful
								but indirect physical stimuli by the kahunas. To be less than kind, to neglect one's
								duty, or to fail in any way which leaves one feeling ashamed, tends to form a guilt
								complex. Often such guilt complexes are present without our knowing it.
							</p>
							<p>
								The low self is the "conscience," once it has received from the middle self a training
								in what is right and wrong. This training is usually received in childhood at the
								instigation of watchful parents. Spankings do much to fix beliefs in right and wrong
								in the low self before the age of six.
							</p>
							<p>
								When one is smitten by his conscience, it is an emotional reaction, not a logical
								one. Of course it may be both, if the middle self agrees that it is doing wrong.
								This vital fact is well illustrated by the peculiar morality of the savage head
								hunters. They would consider it a great sin to take the head of a friend, but an
								act of great virtue to take the head of an enemy. Conscience is NOT a God-given
								instinctive something. It is simply the natural emotional reaction of a low self
								which has been taught that certain things are right and others wrong.
							</p>
							<p>
								Only the middle self can sin. The animals in the jungle eat each other without sinning.
								The low self is an animal even if associated with a middle self, and it is also
								incapable of sinning.
							</p>
							<p>
								As has been explained earlier, the contact between the High Self and the lower man
								is through the low self and along the connecting cord of invisible shadowy body
								substance derived from the shadowy body of the low self. If the low self is convinced
								that the man has been guilty of a wrong act, it feels shame and refuses to contact
								the High Self in the regular telepathic way across the connecting cord. Thus prayers
								are not delivered to the High Self. Its aid is not requested &ndash; and, under
								the law that man must be allowed to be a free agent in most things &ndash; no aid
								or guidance is given.
							</p>
							<p>
								The result is that the man blunders and gets into trouble. The kahunas spoke of
								this as a BLOCKING OF THE PATH. The "path," the "way," and the "light" are all symbol
								words indicating the connection between the low self and the High Self. The kahuna
								words la and ala translate into these three words. The same use of these words as
								symbols is found in India and in Christianity, but with less direct and definite
								meanings.

							<h5>
								Basic Beliefs
							</h5>
							<p>
								Because it is confusing to try to consider the teachings of many religions at the
								same time and to compare them with the lore of the kahunas, it is better to compare
								the kahuna beliefs with the basic activities found underlying religions.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first thing to examine is the basic human urge to look to a "god" of some kind
								for help, or to try to appease the god if he seems to be angry and visits mankind
								with plagues and disasters.
							</p>
							<p>
								A contact with the god must be made, and a spoken prayer or request for attention
								is made, as "Oh, hear our prayer!" As prayers were either not heard or not given
								attention, the suppliant resorted to various aids to prayer. The American Indians
								in our Southwest made elaborate sand paintings to symbolize the thing desired in
								prayer. Jews and Christians fasted as an adjunct to prayer. There were cleansing
								rites which were supposed to make man sufficiently spotless to be acceptable before
								the god in prayer.
							</p>
							<p>
								This cleansing process grew to be an elaborate ritual in most religions. Dogmas
								developed to teach that a man guilty of sins could not make his prayers heard unless
								he was first "forgiven" and ritually cleansed. Because the prayers of the good men
								got scarcely better answers than those of the wicked, there was a hunt for sins
								of which a good man might be guilty. The sins of omission, and the "original sins"
								were invented.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the process of obtaining forgiveness for all forms of sin, and for the general
								purpose of pleasing the gods and thus gaining their favors, OFFERINGS were made.
								Such offerings were common in the dawn of history. Fruits, flowers, foods, sacrificial
								animals, and even human sacrifices were used. Altars were erected as the place of
								sacrifice, and priests were appointed to officiate in making both offerings and
								prayers.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the gods were appeased and the floods and plagues or individual difficulties
								ceased, there were thank-offerings, but these played a small part in the general
								scheme.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the time of death, and the departure of the (almost universally recognized) soul
								or souls of the man from the body, prayers and sacrifices were made by the living
								for the happiness and comfort of the departed in the "other world." The wicked might
								go to a hell, or the average run of men might go to a place of temporary punishment.
								A deathbed ritual of prayer was commonly performed by a priest in as widely separated
								places as the Western seats of Christianity and the inner fastnesses of Tibet.
							</p>
							<p>
								There nearly always arose a doctrine of a "chosen people" in the course of development
								of religions. The Jews were such a chosen people. The convert to Christianity became
								one of the chosen because he accepted Jesus as the focal point of his religious
								beliefs and depended upon an initiation into the ranks of the chosen through baptism,
								confirmation and various similar rites, the end being to attain "salvation."
							</p>
							<p>
								All the "salvations" were more or less alike in religions. All need of being "saved"
								arose from a dogmatic belief that man in his normal state was lacking in some way
								or ways. He might have been "born in sin," or he might have been from a tribe which
								was not of any one "chosen" people. In India where there was no vicarious atonement
								and resulting salvation through a belief in a "savior," the way of salvation was
								long and difficult. It led through thousands of incarnations while karma was being
								lived down.
							</p>
							<p>
								Nearly all religions eventually developed to the point where there was a dogmatic
								belief that a special building or place was necessary for proper prayer to the gods.
								From the altar and shrine grew the church and the temple.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the primary purpose of religion was to appease the gods or gain answers to
								prayer from them, there was also an idealistic concept frequently present in the
								belief that praise and worship of the gods was necessary. The primitives danced
								to entertain the god. They fed the god with burnt offerings and blood sacrifices
								&ndash; blood long being considered a probable source from which the god might derive
								sustenance (in Christianity the "blood of the Lamb" was necessary to appease God
								and get Him to allow a vicarious atonement for the sins of the world, etc., etc.).
							</p>
							<p>
								Dogmas multiplied and priesthoods flourished as each religion grew older. In the
								eternal search for a means of getting an answer to prayers from a god, most illogical
								and surprising practices developed. Flagellation, castration, abhorrence of all
								normal sex relations, circumcision to prevent masturbation &ndash; the list is very
								long. In India the austerities practiced were and are surprising. The teaching of
								Christianity that one should "sell all and give to the poor, then follow me," has
								never produced a great effect in individual action except as one became a monk or
								nun, but in India the beggar's bowl and yellow robes are taken outside the monastery
								as well as by members of monastic orders.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here and there may be seen religious dogmas combined with rites of purification
								which touch on the realm of high magic. In Ceylon a rite of purification depends
								upon the ability of the individual to pass the stern test of the fire-walk. (I have
								described this rite as seen by the Englishman in Burma and filmed, and whose motion
								pictures I saw. Some of the candidates walked the fire successfully, and others
								failed painfully or fatally.)

							<h5>
								Science
							</h5>
							<p>
								The Science of Psychology and the Science of Psychism are not a part of religion.
								Religion has to do with reverence for gods or with the fear and worship given them.
								As soon as we ask favors of the gods through prayers and additional rites, we enter
								the field of magic, which is not pure religion.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Religion," to quote again from Professor Paul Tillich of Columbia University, "is
								the relation to something ultimate, unconditioned, transcendent. The religious attitude
								is consciousness of dependence, surrender, acceptance.... Magic is the exercise
								of immanent power; religion is the subjection to the transcendent power.... And
								even then, the distinction is permanently endangered from two sides. First, there
								is the necessity that the transcendent manifests itself concretely, and, thereupon,
								these concrete manifestations become for the religious imagination magic powers.
								And secondly, there is the natural desire of man to gain power over the divine,
								thus making it an object of magical practices."
							</p>
							<p>
								Huna may be called a science rather than a religion because it has almost nothing
								of religion (as defined above by a Professor of Philosophical Theology) in it. The
								High Self is not a god. It is the third spirit or part of the man. It is no more
								divine than is the low self or the middle self. It is simply a step advanced in
								... <span class="note">[words missing in original]</span> ... or mental powers and
								creative abilities. It is older and wiser and is parental in its attitude. It falls
								under the science of psychology as certainly as do the low and middle (or subconscious
								and conscious) selves.
							</p>
							<p>
								In presenting this report on Huna, I have elected to call Huna a psycho-religious
								system for the reason that it includes so much that has always been considered a
								part of religion. However, I consider Huna a science in the strictest sense of the
								word. The kahunas knew nothing about gods &ndash; Beings higher, perhaps, than the
								High Self. They had no way of sensing such Beings. They admitted freely that it
								was probable that there were such Beings, but were honest in saying that they were
								convinced that the human mind would never be able to do more than imagine them &ndash;
								invent them in terms of lower humans.
							</p>
							<p>
								In other words, the basic urge of older religions to appease gods or gain favors
								from them (religion plus magic) is replaced in Huna by the purely magical operation
								of prayer to the High Self for the purpose of gaining favors in the way of healing
								or bettering our circumstances through a change in the predictable future.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through the High Self an appeal was made by the kahunas to the spirits able to control
								wind and weather, also to spirits in control of lower forms of life. (Pacts made
								in this manner prevented sharks in Hawaiian waters from attacking human beings -
								or at least that is the claim made by the kahunas of yesterday. In any event, the
								same breed of sharks that attacks men in other places is harmless in Hawaiian waters.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Instead of feeding the gods with blood and burnt offerings, the kahunas understood
								the secret that lay behind the externals of all sacrifice. The High Self, in order
								to produce results in the physical plane must draw from the physical body of the
								earthy man sufficient vital force or mana to use in the work.
							</p>
							<p>
								The custom of building temples or shrines to aid in contacting the gods was not
								practiced by the genuine kahunas, although the spurious kahunas of later times built
								temples of stone and offered sacrifices in vain efforts to get magical results.
							</p>
							<p>
								The true kahunas needed no temples or shrines. They knew how to send the telepathic
								message to the High Self at will, regardless of place or conditions. They used no
								altar symbols, no incense or other mechanisms. (These things were reserved for use
								as physical stimuli to impress the low self when suggestion was being given for
								various purposes.)
							</p>
							<p>
								The various rites used in religions to insure the dying a survival in spirit form
								and a certain amount of happiness as a spirit, were unknown to the kahunas. They
								had no place in their matter-of-fact science for dogmas which would demand a "salvation."
								Their teaching was simply that all people should know that the spirits of men survived
								death and that the memories and complexes of physical life were carried over into
								the spirit life, making it advisable for the individual to rid himself of guilt
								complexes before death. (This may have given rise in ancient times to the non-kahuna
								practices aimed at preparing man for a better life after physical death.)
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas believed that after death there was a continuation of growth and progression,
								the low self reincarnating as a middle self in due time and the middle self eventually
								rising to the level of the High Selves, first learning to watch over lesser forms
								of life, and in the end becoming the "utterly truthworthy parental spirit" or High
								Self of a low and middle self incarnated in the physical., Not a great deal was
								known about this process of growth and progression, so little was taught about it
								except as a part of the speculative doctrines of Huna. The graduation, so to speak,
								of the low self to the level of a middle self is accomplished after death during
								a period of inactivity resembling a long sleep. One is reminded of the worm which
								becomes a pupa, is inactive for a time, and then bursts forth a butterfly.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most important preparation for death must be done by the individual. He must
								reduce his guilt complexes to the minimum and free himself of dogmatic religious
								beliefs which will hinder him after he becomes a spirit. It is not necessary to
								spend more than a few months on the spirit plane before continuing the growth process,
								providing one knows the ropes as did the kahunas. Knowing Huna is knowing the ropes.
							</p>
							<p>
								All we can take with us at the time of death is knowledge, and it should be the
								first duty of each of us to accumulate the correct "take-withable" knowledge by
								a careful study of the psycho-religions and the discarding of beliefs which cannot
								be substantiated.
							</p>
							<p>
								It should be held in mind that no two inspired or revealed religions agree, and
								that teachings obtained from the departed through mediums show a similar disagreement.
								There may be one correct revealed religion and one correct teaching from a spirit
								or a spirit group, or there may be a partial truth in all such sources of information.
							</p>
							<p>
								At present we have before us only one basic and practical criterion by which to
								measure such material, and that is Huna. I say this, because Huna worked. It made
								fire-walking practical. It made mental healing practical, also instant healing through
								the aid of the High Self. It made practical the system of gaining the aid of the
								High Self in changing the circumstances and future of the individual.
