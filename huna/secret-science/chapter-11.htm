								Christian Shrine at Lourdes
							</h4>
							<p>
								At the Christian shrine at Lourdes, doctors have examined those who have come hoping
								to be healed. For over fifty years records have been kept of those who have been
								healed. These records detail the afflictions, give the time consumed in the healing,
								and the condition after healing.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are two kinds of miraculous healing. The first is so rapid that it may be
								called instant healing. In a matter of seconds, or, at most, minutes, the diseased
								or deformed parts or tissues of the body are changed to healthy normal ones.
							</p>
							<p>
								The second kind of healing is like the first except that the process of replacing
								abnormal tissues may take a few days. It seems to depend upon a great speeding up
								of normal healing processes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Those who come to pray for others, rather than for themselves, seem more apt to
								be healed than those who pray for themselves alone.
							</p>
							<p>
								Nearly all the ills common to man have been healed in this way. Cancers have vanished,
								deformed bones have been straightened, sight and hearing have been restored &ndash;
								the list is blessedly long.

								<span class="block">Case 20:</span> A Kahuna Heals A Broken Bone Instantly
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:
							</h5>
							<p>
								Religion explains the miracle by saying that God or a Saint or other Superhuman
								Being performs the miracle of instant healing, but, as in the case of fire-walking
								and seeing the future (and changing it), only the kahunas have offered detailed
								explanations of how such things are accomplished. Our one and only hope of learning
								to get miracles performed by the Higher Beings, as a matter of daily occurrence,
								in any place, lies in close study and understanding of the beliefs and practices
								of the kahunas. It may well be objected that praying Christians and Mental Healers
								sometimes get miraculous cures of both body and purse. This is, happily, true. But
								they do not get them with certitude. There are a million failures to one successful
								demonstration. While the kahunas did not always succeed in gaining the help of a
								High Self each time they asked, their average of success was so high that there
								can be little comparison.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Brigham was fortunate enough to be able to study several cases of instant healing
								performed by kahunas, but the most simple case to come to my attention was the following.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:</h5>
							<p>
								My close and trusted friend, J. A. K. Combs, of Honolulu, who is a fellow student
								of kahuna lore, and who has given me much invaluable aid, had for a grand-mother-in-law
								one of the most powerful women kahunas in the Islands. She loved Combs and told
								him many things about her secret knowledge, her power, and her practices. On the
								occasion in question, Combs attended a beach party at her country home. Many guests
								had arrived when a car drove up to the edge of the beach sand and several Hawaiians
								got out. Among them was a man who was slightly intoxicated. He missed his step from
								car to soft sand and fell. As he fell, there was the characteristic snapping sound
								of breaking bones.
							</p>
							<p>
								Inspection showed a compound fracture of the left leg just above the ankle. The
								bone ends pressed visibly out against the skin. Combs, who had heard the familiar
								sound of breaking bones and had himself suffered such a break, realized the seriousness
								of the injury and proposed that the man be taken at once to Honolulu for treatment,
								but the elderly kahuna arrived on the scene and took over. Kneeling beside the injured
								man she straightened the foot and leg, pressing on the place where the ends of the
								broken bones pushed out the skin, and then began a low chanted prayer for healing.
								In a short time she fell silent. Those who stood about watching tensely could see
								nothing until her hands suddenly moved slightly on the man's leg, and she took them
								away, saying quietly in Hawaiian, "The healing is finished. Stand up. You can walk."
							</p>
							<p>
								The injured man, now entirely sobered, rose wonderingly to his feet, took a step,
								and then another. The healing was complete and perfect. The leg showed no indication
								of the break in any way.
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:</h5>
							<p>
								The kahuna explanation of instant healing is one which involves (1) a High Self
								with a superior form of mentality and with ability to do the work. (2) The high
								voltage of vital force or mana, natural to all High Selves, and used in all miraculous
								works. And (3) the flesh, bone and blood (technically these are all known as bodily
								"tissues") of the injured limb (taking the case above as an example), and the aka
								or shadowy body of the patient, particularly that part of it which duplicated the
								broken section of the leg.
							</p>
							<p>
								The shadowy body of the low self is a mold of every cell of the body, also of its
								general shape, so the kahunas believed. To heal a broken bone, the High Self dissolved
								the injured bone and other tissues into ectoplasm, this usually being invisible,
								but not always. As the shadowy body mold is made of invisible (etheric?) substance,
								it cannot be broken or injured. Thus, with the mold of the normal leg there at hand,
								the ectoplasmic material of the dissolved parts is resolidified in the mold, with
								the result that the healing is instant and the limb is restored to its former condition.
							</p>
							<p>
								This explanation applies equally to all healing in which abnormal conditions of
								deformity or disease prevail. If there is a cancer, it is changed to ectoplasmic
								substance and then made into normal tissue to fill the mold of that part of the
								body as it was before the cancer developed.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the kahuna explanation is simple to state in general terms, it must be noted
								that there are certain conditions which must be made right, if they exist, before
								healing is granted. There must be no complexed doubt or conviction of sin or guilt
								that has not been cleared away. What has been called "faith" is a condition of freedom
								from any hindering complex.
							</p>
							<p>
								The COMPLEX or FIXATION OF IDEAS was referred to by one kahuna as the "thing eating
								inside." It is a belief or conviction held by the low self. It may or may not be
								a correct belief. Once it is fixed or lodged in the memory of the low self, it is
								difficult to find and more difficult to remove.
							</p>
							<p>
								Modern psychology, fortunately, has explored the subconscious and found the complex,
								making it unnecessary to go to great lengths to prove that the kahunas were right
								in believing that such things existed and caused trouble.
							</p>
							<p>
								One thing, however, which modern psychology has not yet learned, but which the kahunas
								knew to their profit, is the fact that all efforts to remove a complex will be far
								more successful if those efforts include a combination of logical appeal to the
								patient's conscious self, mild suggestion, and the use of a physical stimulus to
								accompany the administering of suggestion.
							</p>
							<p>
								The low self is so accustomed to having the middle self think of imaginary things,
								that anything resembling an imagining is paid scant attention. The low self is best
								impressed by REAL AND TANGIBLE THINGS. For instance, the water used in religious
								ceremonies to "wash away sins" is something tangible, and therefore impressive to
								the low self. The kahunas have used water in ceremonial washing of the patient while
								giving the spoken suggestion that all sins are being washed away. They have used
								many other physical stimuli &ndash; for perhaps ten thousand years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Proof that the broken bone, in the case given above, was dissolved into invisible
								etheric substance or ectoplasm, and then made solid again as bone in the unbroken
								mold of the shadowy body &ndash; such proof &ndash; is difficult to give because
								nothing is to be seen by the observer.
							</p>
							<p>
								For this reason it is necessary to call attention to the findings of Spiritualism
								and Psychical Research, for in these we find visible and tangible bodily tissues
								and other substances which have been seen to vanish into nothingness and to reappear
								&ndash; a process called "dematerialization" and "materialization."
							</p>
							<p>
								Little need be said about the verification of these findings. So many cases have
								been verified by trained investigators that it is no longer possible to deny the
								actuality of the phenomena touched upon in this part of the study of kahuna beliefs.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 21:</span> Proof Through Apports
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								Because of the inability of Science to explain the phenomena of Spiritualism, it
								has been customary for the press and schools to ignore them. For this reason the
								average person knows little or nothing of such phenomena.
							</p>
							<p>
								Take the matter of apports. There are volumes of detailed reports covering instances
								in which objects have appeared or disappeared in a way quite contrary to the accepted
								laws of physics. At Stanford University there are a number of cases filled with
								apported objects produced as from the void by spirits attending the seances of the
								famous apport medium, Bailey. And yet, these amazing happenings are kept from the
								public at large.
							</p>
							<p>
								An apport is something which is dissolved into invisible form at one spot, is carried
								to a desired place, and solidified to the original state. Spirits of the dead are
								usually associated with the process.
							</p>
							<p>
								It has been said by way of objection, that the spirit of a dead man could not do
								things a living man cannot do. This objection is logical enough to throw the unsound
								present theories of Psychical Research into a turmoil, but not the theories of the
								kahunas. The kahunas put forth the belief that the spirits of the dead, just as
								do the spirits of the living, in the body, sometimes gain contact with a High Self
								and get it to use the high voltage of vital force to dematerialize, and later rematerialize,
								the substances contained in the shadowy body mold of the apported object. It was
								believed by the kahunas that all things had a shadow body.
							</p>
							<p>
								We know that when the voltage of an electric current or discharge is sufficiently
								high in atom-smashing machines, various elements are transmuted and become other
								elements. Knowing this, we may agree that the mana or electro-vital force in man,
								when stepped up to the highest voltage, can be used to change visible matter to
								the invisible form, and back again to the visible.
							</p>
							<p>
								In making such changes &ndash; so we are told by Science &ndash; there would be
								generated great heat and cold. But, as the High Self is able to control temperature
								changes in fire-walking, it would have no difficulty in exerting a similar control
								in causing the apporting of objects and things.
							</p>
							<p>
								Living creatures have been frequently used as apports, and have ranged from tiny
								insects through birds, fish, beasts and men. Hot objects have been apported, and
								remained hot upon their arrival.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Cases:</h5>
							<p>
								(A) Ernesto Bozzano, one of the most famous Psychical Research leaders, reported
								an apport case which will well illustrate the matters under discussion.
							</p>
							<p>
								"In March, 1904, in a sitting in the house of Cavaliere Peretti, in which the medium
								was an intimate friend of ours, gifted with remarkable physical medium-ship, and
								with whom apports could be obtained at command, I begged the communicating spirit
								to bring me a small block of pyrites which was lying on my writing table over a
								mile away. The spirit replied (through the mouth of the entranced medium) that the
								power was almost exhausted, but that all the same he would make the attempt. Soon
								after the medium sustained the usual spasmodic twitchings which signified the arrival
								of an apport, but without hearing the fall of any object on the table or on the
								floor. We asked for an explanation from the spirit-operator, who informed us that
								although he had managed to disintegrate a portion of the object desired, and had
								brought it into the room, there was not enough power for him to be able to reintegrate
								it. He added, 'Light the light.' We did so, and found, to our great surprise, that
								the table, the clothes and hair of the sitters, as well as the furniture and carpet
								of the room, were covered with the thinnest layer of brilliant impalpable pyrites.
								When I returned home after the sitting I found the little block of pyrites lying
								on my writing table. Missing from it was a large fragment, about one-third of the
								whole piece, which had been scooped out."
							</p>
							<p>
								(B) A medium named Mrs. Guppy, who was a woman of wealth and note in the early days
								of Spiritualism, gave a sitting with her friends for Henry W. Longfellow in Italy.
								At the sitting a block of ice over a foot square was brought as an apport and dropped
								with a crash on the table. At a second sitting, while the famous poet was holding
								both the medium's hands, several oranges were apported. At still another sitting,
								in which the spirit spoke through the medium and asked what things were desired,
								the following items were apported: A banana, two oranges, a bunch of white grapes,
								a bunch of black grapes, a cluster of filberts, three walnuts, half a dozen damsons,
								a slice of candied pineapple, an onion, a peach, some almonds, three figs, two apples,
								four very large grapes, a potato, and several other objects. At still another sitting
								there were apports of pots of scalding hot tea and sizzling pans of frying eggs.
								Mrs. Guppy herself was brought as an apport from her own home to that of a friend.
								The distance was over a mile, and Mrs. Guppy was very stout.
							</p>
							<p>
								(C) In 1926 at the British College of Psychic Science, Mrs. Barkel, a medium, saw
								the "shadow" of a bunch of violets near an electric light globe overhead. That evening,
								in the same room, at a sitting with the apport medium, Heinrich Melzer, a quantity
								of violets dropped from empty air on to the table.
							</p>
							<p>
								(D) One of the most famous and most studied mediums of the past century was Mme.
								d'Esperance. A spirit called "Yolande" frequently appeared, fully materialized as
								a pretty Arab girl, in good light and produced apports so that the sitters could
								observe all that was to be seen in the process. On June 28, 1890, she brought as
								an apport a rare golden lily measuring more than seven feet from roots to top and
								carrying eleven perfect flowers. Toward the end of the sitting she tried to dematerialize
								the plant to take it away, but the force was too weak by then and she failed. She
								asked that it be kept in a dark closet until she could try again. The plant had
								been borrowed, so she said, and had to be returned. At half after nine on July 5th,
								the plant was removed from the dark closet and placed in the center of the circle
								of sitters. Almost instantly it vanished. Another spirit, not Yolande, explained
								that the plant, in its invisible form, had been brought into the room at the first
								sitting fully an hour before it was solidified and became visible.
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:</h5>
							<p>
								In the above cases may be seen the mention of power or force similar to that suggested
								by the kahunas. The spirits undoubtedly had access to Beings able to use this power
								to produce apports, and, as the living cannot produce apports, it is to be concluded
								that the dead must have aid from some superior Being. The shadowy body of the apported
								objects has been seen at times, filmy, but having the form of the apport. In some
								instances the thinly massed cloud of material is seen, suggesting that in its disintegrated
								condition the substance of the apport may be slightly visible, and, of course, greatly
								expanded.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is no injury done plants, insects, animals or people when they are used as
								apports, even when brought from a distance and passed through sealed doors into
								the seance room. By comparison, the use of the same processes to heal a broken bone
								is but a trifling matter.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the kahunas were not able to give a detailed explanation of how the High Selves
								use the high voltage of vital force to control temperature or to dematerialize and
								rematerialize apports, they were very sure that this force was used and that it
								was nearly always provided by the living. They were also sure that the shadowy body
								was always an important part of the process.
							</p>
							<p>
								People who have been used as apports report either a short period of unconsciousness
								or a similar period in which the senses and mental faculties seem sharpened and
								quickened to a remarkable degree. However, they report little physical sensation
								during the course of the changes. This evidence tends to verify the Huna theory
								that we have in our low shadowy body a duplicate set of all the organs and tissues,
								and that these function when we are temporarily out of the body as in apporting
								cases, or after death when we are permanently out of the body.
