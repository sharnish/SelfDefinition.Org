							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								J. W. Dunne, in his popular book, An Experiment with Time, <sup>[1, 2]</sup> describes
								a simple and very easy method which he learned to use to dream into the future.
								The method is based on the fact that most of us dream of future events but do not
								remember the dreams upon awakening.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">

							<p class="fnote">
								[2. Downloads page at <a href="https://archive.org/details/AnExperimentWithTimeEbook">Archive.Org</a>&nbsp;]
							</p>
							<p>
								A pencil and paper is taken to bed with the experimenter and he impresses upon himself
								the determination to write down his dreams whenever he awakens during the night
								and can recall what he was dreaming.
							</p>
							<p>
								(Most people dream from the moment they fall asleep until they awaken, even if they
								seldom remember a dream and so conclude that they seldom dream.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Dunn kept a record of dreams which he had written down in the night, and found
								in some instances that he had dreamed of certain events in his life fifteen years
								before they occurred. One of these events was important enough to have been crystallized
								long in advance. It was a dream of flying over a pasture in one of the crude planes
								of the early experimental years of flight. He also tabulated the results obtained
								by his friends, and concluded that almost anyone can use the method successfully.
							</p>
							<p>
								In passing, it may be noted that he met the problem of the impossibility of seeing
								what had not yet happened, by the simple expedient of deciding that the past, present
								and future of time are all right here with us, but that we cannot see beyond the
								instant of the present when events become momentarily actualized. Like Ouspensky
								in his Tertium Organum, Mr. Dunn falls back on the idea of a "space-time complex,"
								leaps from that to a fourth dimension, and ends with little more than a play on
								words.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:</h5>
							<p>
								I read An Experiment with Time on a Sunday afternoon in Honolulu in 1926. That night
								I took pencil and paper to bed with me, determined to write down all my dreams in
								order that I might watch for those relating, not to the past or present, but to
								the future. It was a restless night and I arose in the morning with several dreams
								and one drawing of a crude kind on my pad of paper. My notes ran like this: (I omit
								all dreams which did not come true.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Strange, big, fattish man. Came to me and asked if I would help him on an invention
								&ndash; something of an optical nature.... Was at my desk. Had before me a piece
								of a smallish machine, about two feet six inches by four inches in size. Black electrical
								cord and white one running from the rear end of the thing. It looked like a black
								enamelled lid. In a side of this lid, or cap, was a square hole about four inches
								by four inches. On the top of the lid was an hour-glass-shaped setscrew of blued
								steel. (I made the rough drawing here, of the lid.) ... I was in a latticed, low
								kitchen. Fat man there. Stranger also there, tall, slim, light, and about forty.
								Small Hawaiian woman there. I took sensitive paper from a box and placed it in a
								small opening in the machine. The thin man touched a switch and a light flashed.
								I took out the paper and developed it in one of three strange little white photo
								trays. The developed image was a scale, and a pointer which indicated a large number.
								I looked at the men. We laughed. I said, "Well, it works."
							</p>
							<p>
								That was on Sunday night. On the following Thursday afternoon the dreams began to
								come true. The fat man I had seen in my dreams came into my camera store. He wanted
								help in splitting a ray of light to get an image of a weight-scale on a ground glass
								screen and a strip of recording photo paper at the same time. The top of the mechanism
								of the scale was described to me. It checked with the "lid" I had seen in my dream.
								I agreed to help him.
							</p>
							<p>
								The next part of my dream was wrong. The lid was never brought to me and I never
								had it before me on my desk. I did not see it until after the mechanism I worked
								out, and which was built in a local machine shop, was completed. I saw it later,
								however, in the latticed kitchen of my dream. The tall, light man of my dream was
								the mechanic on the job, and it was his kitchen. The small Hawaiian woman was also
								there. She was his wife. The machine was used for weighing sugar syrup in sugar
								refineries.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the problem had been solved and the mechanic had made changes in the machine
								at my direction, I went for the last time to the latticed kitchen to test the machine
								with sensitized paper. As it happened, I had acquired the unfamiliar little white
								photo trays in a trade only the day before. They were of Japanese manufacture and
								of a type and material I had never seen.
							</p>
							<p>
								The results of the test were exactly as I dreamed them, except that we all exclaimed
								laughingly, "Well, it works!" for I had told of my dreams by then and had exhibited
								the notes. I also dreamed of several other future events during this period of experimentation,
								but no dream sequence was ever again so filled with people, mechanisms and places
								so strange to me as to be entirely beyond the chance of imagining them beforehand.
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:</h5>
							<p>
								It will be noted that dreams of the future are not given primarily as warnings of
								accidents, deaths or other troubles. The ordinary life with its normal daily events
								are seen for the most part. It is for this reason that the average person finds
								little more than a temporary interest in using the Dunn method, and soon finds that
								a night of unbroken sleep is preferable to seeing into the future in a hit and miss
								fashion.
							</p>
							<p>
								While my own interest was keen for a time, I, like most others, soon tired of the
								experiment. I then made the mistake of grumbling to myself when sleepily struggling
								to write down a dream. The light, when turned on so that I could see to write, hurt
								my eyes, and soon my low self got the idea that the whole matter was undesirable.
								It formed a complexed opinion of the matter, and thereafter seemed to refuse to
								pass on to me any picture of a future event which it obtained.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the light of my experience, I strongly advise the beginner to provide himself
								with a weak night light which will not hurt the eyes when turned on. Above all,
								tell your sleep self what a pleasure it is to awaken and write down dreams. Of course,
								if one has a recording instrument and can press the button and speak the description
								of the dreams into the mouthpiece, that is the ideal equipment. Also, if my experience
								is a criterion, one will learn inside a month to know by some inward sense whether
								a dream belongs to the future and is worth recording or whether it is a common dream
								with little or no significance.
							</p>
							<p>
								The field of the sleep state offers great possibilities for experimentation in other
								ways. There seems to be no better time for suggestion to enter the low self than
								during normal sleep. And this form of suggestion does not need the hypnotic force
								which we associate with hypnotic suggestion. The spoken word is enough. It may be
								spoken by a machine on which a carefully prepared record is placed. The record may
								be started during the night by a clock, made to repeat, or play through and stop.
								An under-the-pillow speaker may be used. In any event the words are to be played
								with low volume, and in a few nights they will cease to awaken one. The low self,
								which remains sensitive to sound during sleep, seems to hear the worded suggestion
								and make thought forms automatically of those words. These thought forms lodge in
								the shadowy body of the low self and remain there unaffected by the usual rationalizing
								process to which they would be subjected during wakening moments.
							</p>
							<p>
								Rationalizing by the middle self is a process of tying to the words and thoughts
								of a suggestion a contradictory string of thought forms saying that the suggestion
								is not workable. For this reason, one using the recorded suggestions during sleep
								will do well to assure himself that the things which he elects to have read as suggestions
								by the machine during his sleep are acceptable, and that the low self will respond
								and make them workable. This attitude of the middle self, which is one of confident
								expectancy, leaves the low self freely open to accept the suggestions made at night
								and to react to them more and more fully as the nightly repetition goes on.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most of us are smothered by our inhibitions and habits. From childhood our failures
								build in us complexed beliefs in our inability. We suffer from fear complexes. We
								are afraid of people, or even of God. The list is long. Much illness results from
								fixations. For this reason the recorded suggestion given through sleep needs careful
								consideration, and, when it comes to learning to cause the low self to deliver our
								telepathic prayers for instant healing to the High Self, the records may play a
								splendid part in the high magic.
							</p>
							<p>
								While mention should be made of the fact that hypnotized subjects have often been
								reported as telling of events before they occurred, it is only as by accident that
								such prevision comes. It cannot be had upon command of the hypnotic operator, which
								again offers proof that the subconscious &ndash; which responds to suggestion &ndash;
								does not have the ability to see the future, but must have the future shown it by
								a being of superior mental powers &ndash; the kahunas say by the Aumakua or High
								Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the student wishing to examine the record of premonitory abilities infrequently
								displayed by hypnotized subjects, the book by [Charles] Richet, <i>Thirty Years of Psychic
									Research</i>, <sup>[3]</sup> is available in most good libraries.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 17:</span> Foreknowledge in Ordinary Dreaming
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								Dreams which foretell the future are of several kinds. One of the most common is
								that in which the dreamer dreams of a symbol, and, when awake, translates the symbol
								and predicts the general nature of the event. For instance, a gentleman of my acquaintance
								would sometimes dream of seeing a fine red bull. This was for him the symbol of
								a lucky happening to come, and it was seldom that a fortuitous event did not follow
								soon after such a dream.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another kind of dream mixes symbols with events from both past and future. Often
								the mixing distorts the events appearing in the dream. I once dreamed of seeing
								a store window filled with leaping monkeys who flourished fountain pens and wrote
								very long marks with them on moving curls of paper. Later in the same week I recognized
								the store window of my dreams when I saw a toy monkey dancing on a revolving table.
								In the opposite window a small machine was on display in which a paper cylinder
								revolved under the point of a fountain pen making miles of line to show the large
								ink capacity.
							</p>
							<p>
								The dream which touches only the future event and shows it clearly and unmixed,
								may also move from one point in time ahead to others. This type of dream is the
								most deserving of study and cultivation. My father, at a certain time in my boyhood,
								had many such dreams. He would recount them at the breakfast table and ask us to
								remember them and help him check later to see how accurate they were &ndash; he
								recognized them by an inner sensing as dreams belonging to the future.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:</h5>
							<p>
								My father dreamed of a valley in which sheep moved through the Wyoming sage. This
								time progressed, and in the same valley he saw a railroad being built. Another leap
								forward, and a town occupied the valley on one side of the railroad. On the opposite
								side a coal mine was opened and working. Behind the town an oil derrick stood. The
								final step ahead in time showed the same valley, but with everything gone except
								the rail line and the foundations of the vanished buildings.
							</p>
							<p>
								This dream of a single night covered a period of about ten years. Father later recognized
								the valley and saw the new rail line pass through it, then a town, Spring Valley,
								Wyo., rise, the coal mine open, the oil well drilled near the town and later plugged.
								Soon the mine proved too dangerous to work because of gas, and the Union Pacific,
								which owned everything, removed all structures, leaving the valley as last seen
								in the dream. (I personally saw the valley in these various stages.)
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:</h5>
							<p>
								At the time my father had this dream, the coal vein at Spring Valley had not been
								discovered. It was only after the rail line had been laid that the discovery was
								made and the mine opened. It may be said with authority that in this dream there
								was no reading of the mind of another person. It was a straight, clear and detailed
								viewing of events of which no living man could have had knowledge at the time.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are forced to conclude (1) that some intelligent being or form of consciousness
								had been able to foresee the future of the valley, and, in doing so, it demonstrated
								a form of mental power much superior to that of the conscious or subconscious selves.
								(This checks with the High Self of the kahuna system.) Or, (2) we have the alternative
								of concluding that the subconscious has the ability to see into the future, but
								this is a fallacy proven by its inability to see the future under hypnotic command.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 18:</span> Seeing the Future Through Crystal Gazing
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								Crystal gazing produces a condition of relaxation in which the low self is able
								to enter a state similar to that of sleep, with the difference that the middle self
								is able to stand by and observe the dream-like images which appear in the crystal.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:</h5>
							<p>
								(A) I have already mentioned the lady who lived at Lovelock, Nevada, and who learned
								the art of "scrying" as it was called in ancient times. Not only was she able to
								find my friends at a distance and see what they were doing, she was also able to
								make a spoken request for vision of future events and, frequently, to get them in
								her crystal.
							</p>
							<p>
								Two sittings were devoted to trying to look into the future to see what lay ahead
								for me. At that time I was traveling from town to town making photographs, and I
								was about to go to places which I had not visited before. In fact, I had not decided
								what those places were to be. During these sittings she saw two detailed and complete
								parts of my future, each covering a period of about a week.
							</p>
							<p>
								Looking into her crystal, she saw a picture begin to take form in color and motion.
								She described it to me as it moved and changed from scene to scene. First there
								was a small town, laid out in neat streets on either side of a railroad line. There
								was a station and she saw me getting off a train with bags and cameras. The picture
								changed and she saw me entering a modern brick hotel. Next she saw me standing on
								a cottage porch talking to a red-haired young woman dressed in white, and holding
								on her arm a baby with red hair. A following scene showed Indians encamped not far
								from the hotel and holding some kind of a meeting. I was taking pictures of the
								camp.
							</p>
							<p>
								This foreseeing proved to be correct in every detail in less than a month. I took
								a train to Mason, Nevada, and, upon arriving, recognized the town and hotel as ones
								which had been described. During my stay I met the woman dressed in white who had
								red hair, and made photographs of her red-headed baby. Two days after my arrival,
								Indians began to pour into the town for the annual conclave of the tribes of the
								Carson Sink region. They camped near the hotel and I made many pictures of the camp
								and of the Indians.
							</p>
							<p>
								(B) A second town, which I visited after leaving Mason, was Yerrington, Nevada.
								It was exactly as it had been seen in the crystal. I left the railroad in a stage
								and traveled a couple of miles to find the town just as described, one built along
								an old main road, with almost no side streets. I watched for a rooming house bearing
								a sign, "Globe Rooming House," with a picture of a globe painted underneath, and
								it soon came into sight. I knew that this was the place where I was to stay, and,
								after getting down and ringing the bell, I watched hopefully to see whether or not
								the woman with "dark hair and slightly crossed eyes" would appear. She did, and,
								as it turned out, she became my good friend, helping me to get business and lending
								me some much appreciated books on occultism.
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:</h5>
							<p>
								The advantage of crystal gazing over ordinary dreaming is apparent. In the former
								one decides what is desired in the way of forevision, and in the latter, one has
								to take what can be intercepted in haphazard manner from dreams.
							</p>
							<p>
								An interesting angle is to be seen in this mechanism through which the future is
								seen. While in other sittings no vision of the future appeared in answer to a request,
								there were other times when prevision came without request. The requests were spoken
								aloud without knowing to whom they were to be addressed, and it is surprising that
								there were any answers at all.<br />
								Seeing into the future is contrary to present scientific beliefs, as are fire-walking
								and instant healing. Science has no explanation to offer and is stalemate on these
								points, but the kahunas show the way ahead for those of open mind who are ready
								to investigate the evidence which has been accumulated.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 19:</span> Premonitory Information Through Spirits of the
								Dead
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								According to the kahunas, all contact with the spirits of the dead &ndash; as with
								the High Self &ndash; is made by the low self. This applies in particular to the
								spirits in their invisible state in which they must be seen or sensed by what we
								may call "psychic" ability, which is nothing more nor less than the ability to relax
								and let the low self see and report anything from ordinary dreams, to "seeings"
								of the past, the present or the future.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is reasonable to believe that when we die and become "spirits" we have only the
								mental powers we had during life. The act of dying does not make the lower selves
								into a Superconscious with the ability to look into the future. However, we have
								the same ability to contact the High Self and ask for vision of the future, and,
								if we are able to make our presence known to the low self of a living person, we
								may be able to pass on, through it, information we have obtained on the other side.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is an alternate method by which one relaxes and lets the spirit of a dead
								person enter the body and speak through its lips. This is not an uncommon method.
								It is used by "mediums," and is highly approved by Spiritualism. It is studied by
								Psychical Research, and condemned by the Church and by reactionary Science.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this state of trance when spirits are speaking through the medium, they are,
								as if by accident, sometimes able to foretell the future correctly. They cannot
								do so at will, which tends to prove that the High Self must give such information
								to the spirits of the dead as well as to the low selves of the living.
							</p>
							<p>
								The records of Psychical Research are replete with instances in which spirits have
								correctly foretold the future, and with instances in which they have tried to do
								so and failed dismally. The failure has been so frequent that it has caused Spiritualism
								to be looked upon with question.
							</p>
							<p>
								At spiritualistic seances as well as with the Ouija Board and similar mechanisms,
								the low self of a dead person, when it has been cut off from its middle self by
								some accident of dying, loves to communicate with the living. Being unable to use
								good reasoning powers (inductive), it tries to answer any question put to it, usually
								guessing (or reading the mind) what the sitters expect to hear by way of an answer.
								In this fashion no end of seeming lies are told by the spirits and Spiritualism
								given a black eye. When we learn to tell the difference between these isolated low
								self visitors and the regulation normal spirit having both a low and middle self,
								we will not be deceived so often.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:</h5>
							<p>
								(A) At breakfast, when I was a lad, my mother told the family that she had awakened
								in the night and had seen her sister, May, who lived in San Francisco. (We lived
								in Wyoming). She had appeared misty and had said that she had died and that it was
								her wish that her two children be taken and reared by my mother. The next day a
								telegram came telling of the sudden death of May. The two children were, as requested
								by the ghostly mother, taken into our family to be reared.
							</p>
							<p>
								(B) A spirit speaking through the well-known Australian medium, Mrs. Foster Turner,
								at a seance in February, in 1914 with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, gave the following
								premonitory information (which later turned out to be correct).
							</p>
							<p>
								"Now, though at present there is not a whisper of a great European war at hand,
								yet I want to warn you that before this year, 1914, has run its course, Europe will
								be deluged in blood. Great Britain, our beloved nation, will be drawn into the most
								awful war the world has ever known. Germany will be the great antagonist, and will
								draw other nations in her train. Austria will totter to its ruin. Kings and kingdoms
								will fall. Millions of precious lives will be slaughtered, but Britain will finally
								triumph and emerge victorious."
							</p>
							<p>
								This sitting was in a hall and the prediction was heard by nearly a thousand people
								composing the audience.
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:</h5>
							<p>
								Knowing that the future can be foreseen, it takes no great stretch of imagination
								to grasp the kahuna idea of a High Self with superior mental powers which enable
								it to see ahead. But, and this is far more difficult, we cannot so easily imagine
								this ability at work when it passes from a general prediction, such as we might
								make by guessing at the outcome of present conditions, to the detailed prediction.
								If the High Self used the type of reason that we middle selves use, it could only
								guess, and as it gives small details, there is either a magnificently superior form
								of reasoning or super-reasoning brought into play, or, as the kahunas believed,
								the future event or condition is actually a real thing, formed though it is of invisible
								shadowy body (aka or mea) substance similar to that of which thought forms are composed.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the High Selves, working in a UNION or ONENESS quite beyond our comprehension,
								take the deeds and thoughts and desires of the world of middle and low self humanity,
								and, averaging all these, produce the pattern of the future, then that pattern is
								visible on the High Self plane of consciousness, and all its details are crystallized
								and set in so far as the main pattern is determined.
							</p>
							<p>
								These conditions bring home to us the fact that the High Self has powers of mentation
								so greatly superior to ours that we can hardly conceive of them, to say nothing
								of the impossibility of understanding how they work. We can know so little. We must
								speculate so much. However, all we really need to know to be able to make practical
								use of our semi-knowledge is the part we must play to gain the aid of the High Self
								to shape our future toward health, success, and more kindly living and service.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas believed that the great events of the future were set and could be foreseen
								far ahead. World or national events might be seen hundreds or even thousands of
								years ahead. The future of the individual, because of the shortness of a human life
								time, could be seen only months or years ahead.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas demonstrated constantly their ability to foresee the future of the individual
								and gain the aid of the High Self to change it for the better. From this we can
								conclude that the future of the world and nations might also be foreseen and changed
								by concerted effort, were we sufficiently enlightened. Today, when we consider the
								possible use of the atom bomb as a weapon, we might, if greed did not rule the world,
								still be able to take such concerted action as to change what appears &ndash; even
								to our blind eyes &ndash; to be inevitable disaster.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unfortunately, the majority of mankind is moved by greed and the animal instincts
								of the low self with its complexed and unreasoning hates and fears, rather than
								by the unemotional logic of the middle self. Few indeed listen to the promptings
								of the High Self where the rule of Love and Service holds sway.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our conscious mind selves may be said to rule the world, but they are dominated
								by the low selves which are still animals, willful, savage and unthinking. As middle
								selves we have been given free will, but until our cumulative world experience is
								sufficient to teach us the lessons we must learn, we will use that gift of free
								will very badly, both as individuals and as nations.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas taught that there was an ideal condition to which the individual might
								aspire. It was a condition in which the aid and guidance of the High Self was requested,
								received, and then acted upon. The one rule of life that must be obeyed was that
								we should do nothing to hurt another. For those more advanced, the rule included
								loving service. Love can unite men and enable them to do great works for the good
								of all. Hate and fear can unite men only for war and destruction.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the kahunas were at their best in Polynesia, they taught the people to live
								without hurting others. Those who willfully hurt others were considered worthy of
								death, and were frequently punished with the death prayer. It was the means of developing
								in Polynesia the most friendly and considerate people in the entire world. All the
								early explorers marveled at this and mentioned it in their writings without exception.
								It was the nearest approach to a Golden Age during the span of time covered by recorded
								history.
