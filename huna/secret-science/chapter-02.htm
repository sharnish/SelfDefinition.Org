								First and foremost, It Works</h4>
							<p>
								There are two features that make the psycho-religious system of the "Secret" (Huna)
								outstanding and set it apart from modern systems of either religion or psychology.
							</p>
							<p>
								First and foremost, IT WORKS. It worked for the kahunas and it should work for us.
							</p>
							<p>
								Second, and but slightly less significant, it works for men no matter what their
								religious beliefs.
							</p>
							<p>
								The finest example of a workable piece of magic which functions perfectly in the
								hands of any and all religionists, or in the hands of heathens and savages, is FIRE-WALKING,
								which has been practiced for centuries and which continues to be practiced today
								in many parts of the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fire-walking has another thing to recommend it. It involves feet, and burning coals
								or other burning hot materials, such as stone, or even pure flame. Now, there is
								nothing mysterious about feet, or hot things. Both are subject to the most painstaking
								examination, and neither is subject to the manipulations of trickery.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to feet and heat, there is a third element which cannot be seen, tested
								or examined. But it is just as real and just as free from danger of trickery. This
								third element is what I call "MAGIC" for want of a better word.
							</p>
							<p>
								This third element is certainly present when feet contact heat, and burns do not
								result in the usual way.
							</p>
							<p>
								War has been waged steadily on superstitions for at least two centuries. The growth
								of the sciences was dependent on the ability of scientists to fight up through superstitions
								and religious dogmatic taboos. Today, however, scientific denial of psychic and
								psychological phenomena has turned out to be a dogmatic taboo of science itself.
								Our schools and our press have done their best for years to discredit all things
								which could not be explained, setting up the cry of "Black superstition!" Because
								of this attitude the average person has been led to believe that all magic, and
								especially such things as fire-walking, are the beginning and end of trickery.
							</p>
							<p>
								If my report is to get a hearing, I must prove that magic is a fact. I shall prove
								that it is. But, for the reader who has already decided that no such proof can be
								given to his personal satisfaction, I say this: Read my report anyway. It offers
								much new and exciting material for thought, and will be found entertaining, if nothing
								else. And when you finish it, see if you can give a better set of answers to its
								puzzling questions than did the kahunas.
							</p>
							<p>
								For convenience sake in my report, I shall place major units of evidential material
								under case headings, with preliminary notes of introduction and with a comment at
								the end.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the first case I draw from Dr. Brigham's investigations and personal observations
								in the field.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 1:</span> Dr. Brigham Fire-Walks on Red Hot Lava
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								The usual explanation for fire-walking is that the feet are so calloused that they
								cannot be burned, or that they have been toughened by alum or other chemicals. Also,
								the coals or hot rocks are said to be covered with a layer of ashes, or not to be
								hot enough to burn. Harry Price, in trying to explain the fire-walking of Kuda Bux
								(a Kashmiri Mohammedan) before the University of London Council for Psychical Investigations
								in 1936, wrote:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									"It is hardly necessary to point out that, in rapid walking, the whole of the foot
									is not put into contact with, or withdrawn from, the ground at one instant, so that
									no portion of the skin was in contact with the hot embers for as long as half a
									second."
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								In the case about to be presented, it will be noted that none of these explanations
								is adequate.
							</p>
							<p>
								I give the account as I recorded it in my notes shortly after getting it at first
								hand from Dr. Brigham. To make it more visual I have tried to reproduce his own
								words and expressions.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:</h5>
							<p>
								"When the flow started," related Dr. Brigham, "I was in South Kona, at Napoopoo.
								I waited a few days to see whether it promised to be a long one. When it continued
								steadily, I sent a message to my three kahuna friends, who had promised to let me
								do some fire-walking under their protection, asking them to meet me at Napoopoo
								so we could go to the flow and try fire-walking.
							</p>
							<p>
								"It was a week before they arrived, as they had to come around from Kau by canoe.
								And even when they came, we couldn't start at once. To them it was our reunion that
								counted and not so simple a matter as a bit of fire-walking. Nothing would do but
								that we get a pig and have a luau (native feast).
							</p>
							<p>
								"It was a great luau. Half of Kona invited itself. When it was over I had to wait
								another day until one of the kahunas sobered up enough to travel.
							</p>
							<p>
								"It was night when we finally got off after having to wait an entire afternoon to
								get rid of those who had heard what was up and wished to go along. I'd have taken
								them all had it not been that I was not too sure I would walk the hot lava when
								the time came. I had seen these three kahunas run barefooted over little overflows
								of lava at Kilauea, and the memory of the heat wasn't any too encouraging.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The going was hard that night as we climbed the gentle slope and worked our way
								across old lava flows towards the upper rain forests. The kahunas had on sandals,
								but the sharp cindery particles on some of the old flows got next their feet. We
								were always having to wait while one or another sat down and removed the adhesive
								cinders.
							</p>
							<p>
								"When we got up among the trees and ferns it was dark as pitch. We fell over roots
								and into holes. We gave it up after a time and bedded down in an old lava tube for
								the rest of the night. In the morning we ate some of our poi and dried fish, then
								set out to find more water. This took us some time as there are no springs or streams
								in those parts and we had to watch for puddles of rain water gathered in hollow
								places in the rocks.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Until noon we climbed upward under a smoky sky and with the smell of sulphur fumes
								growing stronger and stronger. Then came more poi and fish. At about three o'clock
								we arrived at the source of the flow.
							</p>
							<p>
								"It was a grand sight. The side of the mountain had broken open just above the timber
								line and the lava was spouting out of several vents &ndash; shooting with a roar
								as high as two hundred feet, and falling to make a great bubbling pool.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The pool drained off at the lower end into the flow. An hour before sunset we started
								following it down in search of a place where we could try our experiment.
							</p>
							<p>
								"As usual, the flow had followed the ridges instead of the valleys and had built
								itself up enclosing walls of clinker. These walls were up to a thousand yards in
								width and the hot lava ran between them in a channel it had cut to bed rock.
							</p>
							<p>
								"We climbed up these walls several times and crossed them to have a look at the
								flow. The clinkery surface was cool enough by then for us to walk on it, but here
								and there we could look down into cracks and see the red glow below. Now and again
								we had to dodge places where colorless flames were spouting up like gas jets in
								the red light filtering through the smoke.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Coming down to the rain forest without finding a place where the flow blocked up
								and overflowed periodically, we bedded down again for the night. In the morning
								we went on, and in a few hours found what we wanted. The flow crossed a more level
								strip perhaps a half-mile wide. Here the enclosing walls ran in flat terraces, with
								sharp drops from one level to the next. Now and again a floating boulder or mass
								of clinker would plug the flow just where a drop commenced, and then the lava would
								back up and spread out into a large pool. Soon the plug would be forced out and
								the lava would drain away, leaving behind a fine flat surface to walk on when sufficiently
								hardened.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Stopping beside the largest of three overflows, we watched it fill and empty. The
								heat was intense, of course, even up on the clinkery wall. Down below us the lava
								was red and flowing like water, the only difference being that water couldn't get
								that hot and that the lava never made a sound even when going twenty miles an hour
								down a sharp grade. That silence always interests me when I see a flow. Where water
								has to run over rocky bottoms and rough projections, lava burns off everything and
								makes itself a channel as smooth as the inside of a crock.
							</p>
							<p>
								"As we wanted to get back down to the coast that day, the kahunas wasted no time.
								They had brought ti leaves with them and were all ready for action as soon as the
								lava would bear our weight. (The leaves of the ti plant are universally used by
								fire-walkers where available in Polynesia. They are a foot or two long and fairly
								narrow, with cutting edges like saw-grass. They grow in a tuft on the top of a stalk
								resembling in size and shape a broomstick.)
							</p>
							<p>
								"When the rocks we threw on the lava surface showed that it had hardened enough
								to bear our weight, the kahunas arose and clambered down the side of the wall. It
								was far worse than a bake oven when we got to the bottom. The lava was blackening
								on the surface, but all across it ran heat discolorations that came and went as
								they do on cooling iron before a blacksmith plunges it into his tub for tempering.
								I heartily wished that I had not been so curious. The very thought of running over
								that flat inferno to the other side made me tremble &ndash; and remember that I
								had seen all three of the kahunas scamper over hot lava at Kilauea.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The kahunas took off their sandals and tied <i>ti</i> leaves around their feet,
								about three leaves to the foot. I sat down and began tying my ti leaves on outside
								my big hob-nailed boots. I wasn't taking any chances. But that wouldn't do at all
								&ndash; I must take off my boots and my two pairs of socks. The goddess Pele hadn't
								agreed to keep boots from burning and it might be an insult to her if I wore them.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I argued hotly &ndash; and I say 'hotly' because we were all but roasted. I knew
								that Pele wasn't the one who made fire-magic possible, and I did my best to find
								out what or who was. As usual they grinned and said that of course the 'white' kahuna
								knew the trick of getting <i>mana</i> (power of some kind known to kahunas) out
								of air and water to use in kahuna work, and that we were wasting time talking about
								the thing no kahuna ever put into words &ndash; the secret handed down only from
								father to son.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The upshot of the matter was that I sat tight and refused to take off my boots.
								In the back of my mind I figured that if the Hawaiians could walk over hot lava
								with bare calloused feet, I could do it with my heavy leather soles to protect me.
								Remember that this happened at a time when I still had an idea that there was some
								physical explanation for the thing.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The kahunas got to considering my boots a great joke. If I wanted to offer them
								as a sacrifice to the gods, it might be a good idea. They grinned at each other
								and left me to tie on my leaves while they began their chants.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The chants were in an archaic Hawaiian which I could not follow. It was the usual
								'god-talk' handed down word for word for countless generations. All I could make
								of it was that it consisted of simple little mentions of legendary history and was
								peppered with praise of some god or gods.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I almost roasted alive before the kahunas had finished their chanting, although
								it could not have taken more than a few minutes. Suddenly the time was at hand.
								One of the kahunas beat at the shimmering surface of the lava with a bunch of ti
								leaves and then offered me the honor of crossing first. Instantly I remembered my
								manners; I was all for age before beauty.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The matter was settled at once by deciding that the oldest kahuna should go first,
								I second and the others side by side. Without a moment of hesitation the oldest
								man trotted out on that terrifically hot surface. I was watching him with my mouth
								open and he was nearly across &ndash; a distance of about a hundred and fifty feet
								&ndash; when someone gave me a shove that resulted in my having a choice of falling
								on my face on the lava or catching a running stride.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I still do not know what madness seized me, but I ran. The heat was unbelievable.
								I held my breath and my mind seemed to stop functioning. I was young then and could
								do my hundred-yard dash with the best. Did I run! I flew! I would have broken all
								records, but with my first few steps the soles of my boots began to burn. They curled
								and shrank, clamping down on my feet like a vise. The seams gave way and I found
								myself with one sole gone and the other flapping behind me from the leather strap
								at the heel.
							</p>
							<p>
								"That flapping sole was almost the death of me. It tripped me repeatedly and slowed
								me down. Finally, after what seemed minutes, but could not have been more than a
								few seconds, I leaped off to safety.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I looked down at my feet and found my socks burning at the edges of the curled
								leather uppers of my boots. I beat out the smouldering fire in the cotton fabric
								and looked up to find my three kahunas rocking with laughter as they pointed to
								the heel and sole of my left boot which lay smoking and burned to a crisp on the
								lava.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I laughed too. I was never so relieved in my life as I was to find that I was safe
								and that there was not a blister on my feet &ndash; not even where I had beaten
								out the fire in the socks.
							</p>
							<p>
								"There is little more that I can tell of this experience. I had a sensation of intense
								heat on my face and body, but almost no sensation in my feet. When I touched them
								with my hands they were hot on the bottoms, but they did not feel so except to my
								hands. None of the kahunas had a blister, although the ti leaves which they had
								tied on their feet had burned away long since.
							</p>
							<p>
								"My return trip to the coast was a nightmare. Trying to make it in improvised sandals
								whittled from green wood has left me with an impression almost more vivid than my
								fire-walking."
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:
							</h5>
							<p>
								There you have Dr. Brigham's story. You will now doubtless be interested to know
								how this scientist tried to figure out the reason for his being able to do what
								he had done.
							</p>
							<p>
								"It's magic," he assured me. "It's a part of the bulk of magic done by the kahunas
								and by other primitive peoples. It took me years to come to that understanding,
								but it is my final decision after long study and observation."
							</p>
							<p>
								"But," I asked, "didn't you try to explain it some other way?"
							</p>
							<p>
								The doctor smiled at me. "Certainly I did. It has been no easy task for me to come
								to believe magic possible. And even after I was dead-sure it was magic I still had
								a deep-seated doubt concerning my own conclusions. Even after doing the fire-walking
								I came back to the theory that lava might form a porous and insulating surface as
								it cooled. Twice I tested that theory at Kilauea when there were little overflows.
								I waited in one case until a small overflow had cooled quite black, then touched
								it with the tips of my fingers. But although the lava was much cooler than that
								I ran across, I burned my fingers badly &ndash; and I'd only just dabbed at the
								hot surface."
							</p>
							<p>
								"And the other time?" I asked.
							</p>
							<p>
								He shook his head and smiled guiltily. "I should have known better after that first
								set of blisters, but the old ideas were hard to down. I knew I had walked over hot
								lava, but still I couldn't always believe it possible that I could have done so.
								The second time I got excited about my insulating surface theory, I took up some
								hot lava on a stick as one would take up taffy. And I had to burn a finger again
								before I was satisfied.
							</p>
							<p>
								No, there is no mistake. The kahunas use magic in their fire-walking as well as
								in many other things. There is one set of natural laws for the physical world and
								another for the other world. And &ndash; try to believe this if you can: The laws
								of the other side are so much the stronger that they can be used to neutralize and
								reverse the laws of the physical."
							</p>
							<p>
								In this case we have an instance in which the magical control of heat was of such
								a nature that it did not protect the leather in Dr. Brigham's heavy boots, but did
								protect his feet. There was no chemical solution to protect the feet of the fire-walkers
								from heat. There was no layer of ashes on the lava to insulate it. The lava was
								so hot that, even in running steps where contact was momentary between boots and
								lava, the leather burned to a crisp. The heat was far more than enough to burn feet
								under ordinary circumstances.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 2:</span> A Stage Magician Who Used Genuine Magic
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:
							</h5>
							<p>
								Startling as it may seem, there is real magic sometimes used on the stage instead
								of the supposed mechanical trickery which we universally believe to be in use.<br />
								In this case we have a man traveling with a carnival and saying nothing about the
								magic he uses, unless it be to those inclined and able to accept a statement of
								the true facts. This man and his wife performed in Honolulu and later were kind
								enough to try to explain their magic to me and try to tell how they had learned
								it. Just now we are interested only in what they did and not how they did it.
							</p>
							<p>
								The so-called "fire-magic" usually seen on the stage or in circus and carnival is
								a very poor imitation of what I shall next describe. It consists mainly of such
								feats as holding a lighted cigarette on the tongue and inserting it into the mouth,
								with the coal held safely away from contact with the flesh, or of taking gasoline
								into the mouth and lighting its vapors as they are blown out &ndash; this being
								possible because the vapors burn only when well away from the lips and after mixing
								with air.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:
							</h5>
							<p>
								The fire magician of whom I speak gave his performance in a small tent. A railing
								separated him from his audience by a distance of from three to six feet. His apparatus
								consisted of a pine table on which lay the few things he used. The only part of
								his performance in which real magic was not used was the part in which his little
								dog leaped delightedly through a small hoop soaked with oil and set afire. Everything
								was done at close range and the watchers encouraged to test the heat of every article
								before it was brought into contact with flesh. Every move was made slowly and with
								no attempt to "juggle" or conceal.
							</p>
							<p>
								The following things were done by the magician in each of the two performances which
								I witnessed: (1) He boiled water in a cup and drank it down rapidly while it was
								still bubbling and steaming. (2) Finger-thick pieces of soft pine wood were held
								in the blaze of a gas burner until they were turned at one end to glowing charcoal.
								He took up six of these, bit off the live ends, and chewed them. (3) He heated thick
								iron bars to a bright red heat in the middle and then passed his tongue along the
								red surface repeatedly &ndash; resulting in sizzling steam rising from his bare
								tongue. (4) He lighted an ordinary welding torch; drew the flame down to a cutting
								cone of blue-green; used the flame to cut through iron bars repeatedly; gave the
								bars and the torch to members of the audience for examination. Without adjusting
								the torch in any way, and seeming to have no protection or method of temporarily
								extinguishing the flame, he introduced it repeatedly into his mouth. His mouth remained
								open to its fullest extent and the flame could be seen playing from the end of the
								burner, even when it had been thrust in as far as his lips. (5) He heated an iron
								bar to redness and handled it with bare hands in a way which would have burned another
								severely indeed. He took a heavier flat bar and heated it to redness in the center.
								He took the heated part between his teeth and, holding the ends of the bar in his
								hands, bent it up and down twice from the center. Comment:
							</p>
							<p>
								The bending of the bar held between the performer's teeth caused me to examine his
								teeth carefully. They were strong teeth and not false. This point interested me
								greatly, as the red-hot iron remained for a period of nearly ten seconds in close
								contact with the upper and lower front teeth. Although this was one of his stock
								"tricks" done several times in an evening, the enamel was not cracked on the teeth
								nor did they seem injured. Before the second performance a dentist joined me. He
								stated that contact with such heat would kill nerves and destroy teeth under ordinary
								circumstances, as well as cause intolerable pain while the nerves were still alive.
								Ulceration would result and the teeth have to be pulled out. We scraped the biting
								edges of the teeth with a penknife just before the second performance &ndash; this
								to make sure no invisible insulating substance, no matter how thin and transparent,
								could be present.
							</p>
							<p>
								The question of some solution to insulate from heat seemed most improbable as the
								mouth was itself wet. Also the edges of the teeth would hardly take such a coating
								&ndash; one too thin to be detected or scraped off.&nbsp;<sup class="black">*</sup>

								<span class="block">Case 3:</span> A Professor of Biblical History Reports
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:
							</h5>
							<p>
								On February 21, 1935, I attended a lecture at the Los Angeles Public Library. The
								speaker was Dr. John G. Hill, Professor of Biblical History at the University of
								Southern California. His subject was "Fire-Walking." He had spent four seasons in
								the South Seas and illustrated his lecture with moving pictures he had taken.
							</p>
							<p>
								He told of voyaging from Tahiti to a neighboring island, and of traveling fourteen
								miles overland to see a fire-walking performance. A great pit had been dug, filled
								with logs and stones, and a fire had been burning among them for many hours until
								the stones were red-hot. Invocations were recited to "Nahine (woman) of the Skies,"
								then the performers marched around the pit and made seven crossings back and forth.
								Ti leaves were used in the ceremony to carry and to "dust off" the rocks.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Hill exposed much film, taking close-up pictures of the feet and hot rocks,
								and pictures of the group walking in single file over the stones. He showed one
								native who had been forced to walk the hot stones as an "ordeal" to prove his guilt
								or innocence of a certain charge. As he was badly burned, the natives decided that
								he was guilty, despite his denials, and so had not merited the protection of "Nahine
								of the Skies."
							</p>
							<p>
								The ceremony over, Dr. Hill and his white companions tested the heat of the rocks,
								the following results being reported: Length of time possible to hold the hand at
								a distance of three feet from the rocks: eleven seconds. Time required for a bundle
								of wet, green branches to take fire when thrown on the rocks: thirteen minutes.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the testing of the heat was going on, the head magician was inviting his guests
								to cross the rocks under the protection of his magic. One of the white men joined
								the natives who were accepting the invitation. He walked across the rocks. Dr. Hill
								stated that they were almost red-hot even at that time. The man's shoes were not
								burned in any way, nor were his feet, but, oddly enough, the intense heat burned
								his face so badly that it peeled a few days later.
							</p>
							<p>
								After the lecture I joined a group gathered to hear Dr. Hill answer questions. He
								was asked for any possible explanation of the feat. His answer was that he was totally
								at a loss for an explanation. He could only guess that there might be some superior
								form of mental activity used &ndash; some form which could keep heat from burning.
								He was very positive in his refusal to accept his own guess as a fact.
							</p>
							<p>
								The usual questions were raised as to the possibility of some "undetectable solution"
								being used. This, the Doctor explained, was impossible for the simple reason that
								the white man's shoes had not been so treated and would certainly have been ruined
								by the heat under ordinary circumstances.
							</p>
							<p>
								In an endeavor to throw further light on the mystery, Dr. Hill told of another fire-walking
								performance which he had seen but not photographed. There a young white man, described
								as being "quite a mystic," avowed that if the brown men's magic would protect them,
								his God would also protect him. He questioned the friendly magician in charge and
								was laughingly told to go on across the stones without fear. Disregarding the protests
								of other white travelers, the young man took off shoes and socks. He approached
								the fire-walk with set face &ndash; evidently trying to concentrate on his task
								and hold his faith in readiness. He followed the magician on to the rocks and was
								getting on perfectly when a wild dog-fight broke out close beside the pit. For a
								moment he glanced aside. He lifted one foot suddenly, but his face again became
								set and he continued his crossing. The foot lifted was found later to have a large
								blister on its sole. Dr. Hill vouched for this data, but made no comment on its
								possible significance.
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:
							</h5>
							<p>
								For those who may not have seen moving pictures of fire-walking shown in 1934 news
								reels at theatres, I mention the following sources of photographic or written information:
							</p>
							<p>
								The book, <i>The Colony of Fiji</i>, edited by A. A. Wright and published by the
								Government of Fiji, contains several good illustrations of fire-walking. As a commentary
								on the influence of the scientific attitude in so far as any official publication
								is concerned, we find in this book only one lone paragraph to describe the finest
								tourist attraction in Fiji. This paragraph gives a meager statement of the facts
								of fire-walking, but nothing more.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another book more easily procured in libraries is the Seatracks of the Speejacks.
								<sup>[1]</sup> In its log, which is written by Jeanne Gowen, will be found both
								pictures and full descriptions of the fire-magicians and their work.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 4:</span> Fire-Walking as a Religious Rite in Burma
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:
							</h5>
							<p>
								In Hawaii I made my living for the greater part of my stay in the Islands by keeping
								a kodak and art store in Honolulu. Among my many customers there was, in the year
								1929, an Englishman who had been making a trip around the world. He carried with
								him a 16 mm. moving picture camera and was especially anxious to photograph anything
								out of the ordinary.
							</p>
							<p>
								I had known him several days when he came in one morning and asked me if there was
								anything in Hawaii which was very unusual and which he might "film." I certainly
								knew of many very unusual things in Hawaii, but it was impossible to tell him where
								he might go to get a picture of a kahuna at work with his magic.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the course of our conversation he mentioned the fact that he had bribed the priests
								of a certain temple in Burma to let him hide on a temple balcony and photograph
								the mysterious and far-famed fire-walking of the devotees of the fire god, Agni.
							</p>
							<p>
								I begged for the story and the opportunity to see his pictures. He went at once
								to his hotel and brought back the films. Let me give in detail what I saw and what
								was told that day in my little projection-room.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:
							</h5>
							<p>
								"You see," said my friend, with all the glow of one about to present a wonder of
								wonders, "I don't just tell about the things I see, I photograph them. And it's
								a good thing I do. Now take this film I'm about to show you. If I didn't have the
								film I'd even think I hadn't seen it myself! What I saw is impossible! It's contrary
								to nature! Anyone will tell you it couldn't happen. I'll even tell you that-and
								I saw it with my own eyes not three months ago." He paused and waited for me to
								look up from threading the projector. I did my best to show the proper surprise
								and mystification.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Well," he said grandly, "turn it on. See if you can believe what the camera got."
							</p>
							<p>
								I pulled out a couple of chairs and threw in the switch. On the screen at the end
								of the projection-room lifelike shadows began to flicker and move.
							</p>
							<p>
								"That," explained my new friend, "is the parade. It came before the service in the
								temple's courtyard. That bunch going past now are the candidates who had been getting
								ready for years to take the fire initiation of the Agni cult. Odd beggars, those
								brown people. See the funny looks on their faces. They all seemed to be thinking
								hard about something as they marched along. Never seemed to notice the crowd which
								had gone crazy with excitement just to see them. Seems everyone hopes some day to
								get ready to walk through the fire &ndash; great honor. Walk through once and you
								are set for life. You become some sort of priest or holy man. All the priests in
								the temple have had to walk through fire to get their jobs."
							</p>
							<p>
								"How do they do it?" I asked as I watched the long parade move past with all its
								Oriental trappings.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Wouldn't you jolly well like to know! And wouldn't I?"
							</p>
							<p>
								"What do you think?" I urged.
							</p>
							<p>
								"How should I know? I tried to get it out of the priests, but they spoofed me, I
								think. They said theirs was the one and only true religion and that the fire-walking
								proved it. Said no other faith could make it possible for the converts to walk through
								fire. What they wanted me to believe was that their god kept the feet of the pure
								and holy from being burned. Those who weren't quite pure enough got burned." He
								pointed suddenly to the screen. "See that chap? He's the priest I managed to get
								off to one side to talk to, at about the time the parade was done marching all over
								the city. Good sort. Really rather sporting. He was smart, too."
							</p>
							<p>
								"How do you mean?" I asked.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Not like most of the other beggars &ndash; suspicious and hating white skins. And
								by 'smart' I mean he was smart enough to pretend to believe me when I told him I'd
								studied his religion and wanted to join up. I thought he was going to laugh in my
								face at first, but I jingled money in my pocket and he began to take me seriously."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Perhaps he did take you seriously," I suggested as I watched the parade continue
								to pass on the screen.
							</p>
							<p>
								"He was no fool, not that one. He'd heard money. And when I told him I would join
								up and pay well if I could be allowed to see the fire-walking with my own eyes,
								he got my drift. I insisted on giving him a good donation for his church right there.
								He thanked me for it and told me to meet him in a little while at a side-door of
								the temple. Of course, I didn't say anything about bringing along my little movie
								camera."
							</p>
							<p>
								The scene changed suddenly on the screen and the inner courtyard of the temple appeared.
								It was a large court surrounded by high walls. Below us and at one end was a long,
								high pile of burning charcoal which shimmered with intense heat. It was perhaps
								fifty feet long and about five feet high. Men were beginning to rake it out into
								a long, narrow platform of living coals as I watched.
							</p>
							<p>
								"That's it!" cried my English friend. "I met my priest and got in with my camera
								case without his knowing what I was up to. He took me up to a balcony and hid me
								behind some bamboo screens. I paid some more church dues and he went off. In a minute
								I had a hole in the screen for the lens and one for the finder. My camera was all
								loaded and ready, so I had at it right away.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I took the beginning and the end of the raking out of the coals," he continued
								as the scene changed. "See? Now they are all done and are smoothing down the bed.
								About six inches deep. The charcoal had been burning for ten hours, the priest told
								me. Hot as Hades! Made it so hot, even off there behind the bamboo screen, that
								I could hardly stand it. And see how the rakers have to keep their heads turned
								away and have to keep turning their bodies from side to side so they won't roast.
								Beastly hot!
							</p>
							<p>
								"And now watch that gate in this scene. I began filming when I heard the noise outside.
								I knew the procession was about to come in. There they are! Priests in front and
								the candidates next. All men candidates &ndash; women are too sinful ever to get
								purified. Lots of the men are old. Forty-three I counted. And see their faces &ndash;
								look like they were going to afternoon tea &ndash; got on their most polite faces.
								Those big fellows in uniform are Sikh bobbies. Find them in all British possessions.
								They don't belong to the temple, but the authorities send them along to keep order.
								You'll see them keeping it right soon."
							</p>
							<p>
								As I watched, the procession moved into the courtyard. The candidates gathered in
								a silent group at one end of the long bed of shimmering coals. Behind them gathered
								a mixed crowd of men, women and children, all greatly excited. The Sikhs moved slowly
								through the crowd, their clubs in hand. The priests had gone around the fire and
								met another group of six priests who had come from the temple and were taking their
								places at the opposite end of the bed of coals. In the hands of each of the six
								was a short whip with many lashes. Between them and the fire was a shallow water-filled
								indentation in the paving. It was about six feet wide, four inches deep and ten
								feet long, extending all across the end of the glowing platform.
							</p>
							<p>
								"What are the whips for?" I asked. "Are they to keep the fire-walkers out of the
								water?"
							</p>
							<p>
								"You'll see in a moment," was the hurried answer. "Seems that when they step out
								of the fire into the water, the priests have to beat them to keep their minds off
								their hot feet for a second. I asked the priest but didn't understand what he tried
								to tell me &ndash; something about an old custom."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Do neither the whips nor the fire hurt them?" I demanded.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The whips do. Lay their backs open sometimes. But keep your eyes on the picture.
								See? They are all praying now. Making a lot of funny gibberish. Praying to Agni
								to protect the pure and burn the impure. Gave me the creeps. ..."
							</p>
							<p>
								The camera moved back to the silent group of candidates. They were taking no part
								in the prayers, but simply waiting. They wore only loin-cloths. Then a bent old
								man raised his hand, as in greeting, to someone in the crowd behind. He turned and
								walked slowly to the pathway which danced and shimmered before him. Clasping his
								hands and lifting his face as if in appeal to Heaven, he walked calmly into the
								bed of fire. I caught my breath. With a firm, steady stride he went wading through
								the coals toward the priests who waited at the far end.
							</p>
							<p>
								I scarcely breathed as I watched. His feet were leaving black tracks which closed
								over and were lost in a moment after he had passed. On and on he went, never changing
								his pace. Made slightly misty and unreal by the heat waves rising all about him,
								he seemed more an apparition than a man. As I stared, my amazement was tinged with
								doubt. What I was seeing was an impossibility. But the end of that dreadful pacing
								came at last. The old man stepped from the living fire into the water and was instantly
								taken by the arms on either side by two priests. Their cruel whips flashed three
								times, cutting into the bare brown back. The old man writhed with pain. Two more
								priests took him and hurried him off to a bench beside the wall. They examined a
								foot each, nodded, and hurried back to their places.
							</p>
							<p>
								The camera flashed around and caught another candidate just as he stepped into the
								coals. He was a thin, middle-aged man. His face was turned to the waiting priests
								and his hands were clenched and swinging at his sides. With long rapid strides he
								began his ordeal. His pace quickened. His head went up and his face lifted as if
								away from the heat. He was half-way through and walking more and more rapidly. Suddenly
								his pace broke and he went on at a rapid trot. The trot increased to a run, and
								as he came to the end of the fiery bed he leaped frantically for the water. Hardly
								had he leaped before the whips fell. They fell in flashing blows that doubled the
								candidate as he strained in the strong grasp of the two priests.
							</p>
							<p>
								The camera flashed back again to catch the next candidate.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Was that second man burned?" I faltered.
							</p>
							<p>
								"No. Only three got burned out of the whole bunch," was the abstracted answer. "Watch
								this one," he commanded.
							</p>
							<p>
								A very bent and feeble old man had entered the fire. His hands were stretched imploringly
								upward. After the first few steps he began staggering. He hesitated, leaped into
								the air, plunged wildly forward and fell. Instantly attendants were at the side
								of the bed of coals, long drag-hooks in their hands. They labored frantically, rolling
								the smoking body over and over. They dragged it clear, coals sticking to the burned
								flesh. A jar of water was dashed over the still form and it was lifted and carried
								swiftly away.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Dead before they got him out ..." said a low voice at my elbow. I started slightly,
								having momentarily forgotten my friend. "But that didn't stop them; they kept going
								right through."
							</p>
							<p>
								Again a splice ran through the projector and the camera swung back from a man being
								lashed. It picked up another man at the far end. He had just stepped into the fire
								and in his arms he carried a boy. The child was hardly more than six and dressed
								in loin-cloth only. I gasped in horror. Why should a child be endangered? What if
								the big lean man should fall? Again I held my breath. Would the man never start
								running? Was he insane?
							</p>
							<p>
								"He'll make it," my friend encouraged me.
							</p>
							<p>
								I sank back into my chair. On and on the man went, striding deliberately. The little
								boy became vague and clear by turns, as the heat shimmer was stirred or left stagnant
								by air currents. One small hand lay quietly and confidingly on the bare shoulder
								of the man. The boy gave no sign of fear or concern. Never quickening or slackening
								his pace, the man came at last to the end. He stepped into the water. The whips
								fell but once on his back. He lifted the boy high to keep him from being struck.
								In his gesture was something that hinted of a love great in its triumph. The camera
								followed as he set the child on his feet and led him away toward the wall.
							</p>
							<p>
								Suddenly the film began to change rapidly from scene to scene. Men ran or walked
								a few feet through the fire before vanishing.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I was running short of film," explained the voice in my ear. "I just took grab
								shots. But now watch &ndash; I got another of those who got burned.... There he
								goes! Off at the side &ndash; howling &ndash; now he's into the water. No use to
								beat him. The priest said he'd never walk again. Now keep an eye on this &ndash;
								see that Sikh? See what happened? The crowd went crazy &ndash; religious frenzy
								&ndash; they wanted to try it themselves. See those Sikhs with their clubs! What
								if they hadn't been there to lay them out? The whole crowd would have rushed into
								the fire!"
							</p>
							<p>
								Suddenly the film clicked in the projector and the screen flickered blank and white.
								The picture was ended.
							</p>
							<p>
								"How do you feel?" asked the Englishman curiously.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Rather upset," I answered truthfully.
							</p>
							<p>
								"And wasn't I!" he exclaimed. "I'd seen it with my own eyes! For a penny I'd have
								joined the temple. It gets you. I was a week trying to forget it. It's like seeing
								a ghost or something. Can't get your mind straightened out. You go giddy. Can't
								strike the old balance. Keep wondering if you have everything wrong.... Can't get
								over the idea that there's something in it besides a trick."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Then you really believe it is a trick?" I asked.
							</p>
							<p>
								There was a long moment of hesitation. "What else can it be? ... But how could the
								beggars put anything on their feet that wouldn't wear off in a half-day of parading
								barefoot? ... And how was it some of them got burned if they all had the same stuff
								on their feet to protect them?"
							</p>
							<p>
								"Perhaps they know better than we do what's behind it," I suggested.
							</p>
							<p>
								There was a slow nod. "I almost joined the temple ... just to find out if there
								was...."
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:
							</h5>
							<p>
								In this case it would seem that the priests did not use magic in behalf of the fire-walkers,
								but let them use their own powers as best they might. It is evident that some were
								not yet good magicians, regardless of the religious significance of the matter.
							</p>
							<p>
								As we shall eventually consider a very important point concerning the nature of
								"purification" from' sin in its relation to the ability to perform fire-magic, I
								will now present a short case having to do with descendants of Igorot head-hunters.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 5:</span> Descendants Prove that Their Head-Hunting Ancestors
								Did Fire-Walking Safely
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:
							</h5>
							<p>
								In the Philippines the Igorots have done fire-walking for centuries. They have also
								been head-hunters.
							</p>
							<p>
								To waylay the enemy and take his head is not a business which the Burma devotees
								would consider a help to "purification," but the Igorots seem unaware of this. Here
								we see descendants of the little pink-brown people using fire-magic with the same
								success as did their forefathers.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:
							</h5>
							<p>
								Some Igorot fire-walkers came to Los Angles some years ago and gave several performances
								at the old Chutes Park on Washington Street. My friend, Mr. George Dromgold, saw
								them at work, and his description of their feats gives us the usual picture of hot
								rocks, green branches in hands, and bare feet treading on intensely hot stones with
								no resultant burns.
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:
							</h5>
							<p>
								This case is mainly important to show that headhunters have done fire-walking and
								that the art has come down to the Igorots of our time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Of secondary importance is the fact that magic can be practised in civilized countries
								and away from the favorite plant, ti, which is so largely used in the ceremonial
								throughout Polynesia.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 6:</span> A Japanese Healer uses Fire-Magic
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:
							</h5>
							<p>
								In the preceding cases we have had the two best known forms of fire-magic. For the
								third we must look to a less widespread, but more practical form: fire-magic used
								in healing certain types of disease.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Case:
							</h5>
							<p>
								In 1928-1929 there came to Honolulu a Japanese fire-healer. He advertised his powers
								and began his healing practice. His specialty was the treatment of arthritis. He
								would heat stones so hot that they would ordinarily burn flesh. By the use of magic
								&ndash; according to his later admission in court &ndash; the stones could be packed
								around an affected joint and the trouble cured. There were several cases which he
								had treated successfully, notably the case of a wealthy American who had been unable
								to walk for several months because of arthritis in the knees. After treatment with
								the hot stones by the Japanese healer he recovered the full use of his knees.
							</p>
							<h5>
								Comment:
							</h5>
							<p>
								This case is of importance to our study and proofs, because the records of it are
								preserved in court documents. After practicing for some time in Honolulu, the Japanese
								was arrested at the instigation of the medical men. He was charged with practicing
								medicine without a license, but, as he had administered no medicine, the charge
								pressed against him was that of being a kahuna.&nbsp;<sup class="black">*</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="footnote">
								* The law of Hawaii concerning healing by the use of magic reads: "Section 1034.
								Sorcery &ndash; Penalty, Any person who shall attempt the cure of another by practice
								of sorcery, witchcraft, <i>ananna</i>, <i>hoopiopio</i>, <i>hoounauna</i>, or <i>hoomanamana</i>
								(terms describing the practice of Hawaiian kahunas), or other superstitious or deceitful
								methods, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in a sum not less than one hundred
								dollars or be imprisoned not to exceed six months at hard labor." There is also
								another section of the law which classes the kahuna with bunco men and defines him
								as one posing as a kahuna, taking money under pretence of having magical power,
								or <i>admitting</i> that he is a kahuna. For this the fine goes up to a thousand
								dollars and a year in prison.
							</p>
							<p>
								The court that tried him was not interested in evidence given to prove that his
								treatment was effective, when that of local doctors was not. The Japanese offered
								as his defense the fact that he was using magic and not medicine. Magic is not admitted
								in evidence in any civilized court. He admitted that he had used burning-hot stones
								to cure others. That was enough. He was fined and imprisoned as a kahuna. Later
								he was deported.
							</p>
							<p>
								Had there been any trickery on the part of the Japanese healer, would it not seem
								that he would have acknowledged it rather than go to jail for a longer term, because
								he insisted that he had used real magic? Of course, to deny his magic it would have
								been necessary for the healer to show how he did the "trick," and this was something
								impossible for him to do as there was no trick.

							<h4>
								Summary
							</h4>
							<p>
								Under the classification of "fire-immunity through magic," there must be mentioned
								again the inconclusive tests of fire-walkers made before the World War II period
								by Harry Price and his associates in London. From the early printed reports on the
								tests made with Kuda Bux, it is to be seen that white men were severely burned on
								three attempts to duplicate, even in a small way, the fire-walk performed by the
								man from India. Later on, when the Price group tested another Indian who claimed
								to be a fire-walker, his feats were less spectacular and were safely duplicated
								by at least one white bystander. Price cautiously refuted his statements made after
								the Kuda Bux tests because of the later fiasco with Hassan.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another excellent source of data on fire-immunity is to be found in the annals of
								Psychical Research. In these cases, dozens of which have been studied and reported,
								fire-immunity was supposedly given through the agency of "spirits." The famous medium,
								D. D. Home, at seances, was accustomed to take live coals from fires in fireplaces
								and hold them in his bare hands while blowing them to a white heat. He wrapped these
								coals in fine linen handkerchiefs without scorching the cloth. He held his head
								of bushy hair in the flames of the fireplace, burning not a hair. He held fresh
								flowers in the flames without having them wither. A recent book written around his
								life and experiences tells of these and other magical matters.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fire-immunity, whether gained through prayer to a superhuman being, or through the
								agency of a deceased human "spirit," presumably making such a prayer, is the result
								of a supranormal action &ndash; is magic.
							</p>
							<p>
								All supranormal actions are magic, whether they be instant healing, the production
								of psychic phenomena &ndash; telepathy, prevision, etc. &ndash; or the use of the
								"death prayer."
