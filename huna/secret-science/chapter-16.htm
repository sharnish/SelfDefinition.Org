							<h4>
								Forces of Darkness
							</h4>
							<p>
								There are horrid things which belong in the realm of darkness, but which we are
								powerless to combat because we have become too civilized to realize that they are
								there. Doctors know nothing of them. Priests and ministers have such a garbled idea
								of devils that their advice is useless. Spiritualism knows only enough to be afraid,
								and to warn dabblers to be careful.
							</p>
							<p>
								All primitive peoples know something of them, but their methods of meeting the threats
								of the dark ones is of precarious value.
							</p>
							<p>
								Modern occultists have guessed at a whole train of evil things, writing gravely
								about "black" magic, spells and enchantments. They draw their magic circles and
								retreat within them to escape the dark forces, not sure that such forces are present.
								They go back to the Middle Ages and revive the use of talisman and charm. They cense
								the air and invoke the protection of God through His seventy-two supposed names.
							</p>
							<p>
								The practitioners of mental healing religions recognize these forces as "malicious
								animal magnetism," little understanding their nature, but waging frequent war on
								them when their activities are suspected.
							</p>
							<p>
								Among the priceless gifts to the world from the kahunas, is a clear and comprehensive
								knowledge of the dark forces and the way to fight them.
							</p>
							<p>
								For years I have studied all available information concerning the dark things. My
								knowledge is still incomplete. I cannot penetrate the Huna or "Secret" of the kahunas
								to go into the lowest levels of evil things, nor the highest. However, I believe
								that I have uncovered the facts vital to normal living on this plane and on the
								next one after death. (It is vitally important that we gain the right understanding
								of things here, for when we die and cross into the after-life in the shadowy bodies,
								the things we have believed here become almost fixations, and may haunt us there.)
							</p>
							<p>
								The world of invisible spirits is much like our solid world in as much as it has
								its jungles and wild animals, so to speak. If in this world a man should go into
								wild country and meet lions, tigers and gorillas, he would have to defend himself.
								The same applies over there in the world of disembodied things living in their shadowy
								bodies.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fortunately for us, the contact with the shadowy world is slight. Only now and then
								do the dangerous or actively evil things break through to us and endanger our lives
								or sanity.
							</p>
							<p>
								I believe I am correct in saying that when any sentient being dies and takes up
								life in the invisible world in its shadowy body, it makes its own level or gravitates
								to it through its thinking. If it thinks of familiar surroundings on earth, it makes
								such surroundings &ndash; the kahunas say it makes everything out of the shadowy
								stuff of dreams. Through these dream scenes and places, however, move real and genuine
								spirit beings. Thus, a man when he dies enters a world of dream scenery, sharing
								the dream scenes of his friends and relatives and adding his own touches. The animals
								of the jungle enter a dream jungle. Savage peoples enter places like those they
								left, and find there friends and foes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Seldom do the spirits of the dead, when in contact with the living, report that
								they have gone to a place unlike the earthly places to which they are accustomed.
								They find themselves garbed as they were here, and they live in similar houses;
								the spirits of certain Eskimo tribes report living in the same lands of ice and
								snow as they did on this side.
							</p>
							<p>
								The dead who expect to arrive in a Christian heaven report finding one. Those who
								imagine purgatorial scenes find them. Hell alone seems not to be peopled, perhaps
								because no one really expects to be judged utterly bad.
							</p>
							<p>
								An elderly anthropologist promised before her death to report back to me on what
								she found after death. She did so, through a medium, identifying herself to my entire
								satisfaction by mentioning things she loved to do, to wear and to say while here-living.
								She said that she found friends and American villages and scenery. After becoming
								accustomed to new conditions, she set about hunting for various savage and semi-savage
								tribes with whom she had lived and whom she had studied here. She found that these
								tribes had gravitated to their fellow tribesmen on the there-living side, and inhabited
								the same dwellings in the same scenic surroundings. Her friends recognized her and
								they had happy reunions.
							</p>
							<p>
								Amongst these tribes were certain head hunting peoples of mountainous Formosa &ndash;
								friends of years past &ndash; still imagining that they might do more head hunting
								when they got around to it, although they had rather neglected the art for some
								long time. The anthropologist tried to tell them that they were dead and could do
								no head hunting. She tried to tell them other things, but their ability to grasp
								new ideas proved far, far less than when they were on this physical level of life.
							</p>
							<p>
								The fact that on the other side we have very little vital force compared to what
								we have while in physical bodies, seems to make the difference between swift learning
								and sluggish inability to grasp unfamiliar ideas. All thought demands the use of
								vital force. Memories can be recalled and "remembered" with almost no vital force,
								but to make a new thought form is difficult, especially for the mentally undeveloped.
							</p>
							<p>
								The dead tend to stick tight to the things they believed, hoped for or feared while
								alive. Those here-living who have tried to teach new things to the there-living
								will attest the difficulty of teaching the there-living. For this reason it seems
								of the utmost importance that while here we store the mind with as much knowledge
								as we can gain from the kahunas, as well as modern psychologists and psychical researchers,
								and get the straight of things before we go over.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have repeatedly tried to get my spirit friends to find advanced kahunas who have
								gone across, and usually they fail utterly. The kahunas knew the straight of things
								while alive, and this knowledge gave them a superior ability to progress to more
								important things in the shadow world. They do not get entangled in the dream scenes
								and dream-like vague repetition of acts similar to those they knew on this side.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is a definite going on for those who know the after-life conditions for what
								they are and who are thus enabled to escape being caught there and held back. The
								goal is not that of reincarnation. Only a few come back to inhabit other bodies
								as the Reincarnationists believe. The low selves come back as the middle selves
								of individuals being born on this physical level, but the middle selves, at least
								those from fairly civilized people, eventually go on to the level next higher. Those
								who know this secret waste little time in the "summerland." They obey the urge to
								evolve and to go on.
							</p>
							<p>
								The uninitiated, however, stay on for a very long time in the dream-surroundings,
								frequently coming back to contact the earth and loved ones here. Only now and then
								do they make trouble.
							</p>
							<p>
								The trouble makers are the low selves who get separated from their middle selves
								after death. They are the poltergeists or noisy ghosts who haunt houses and often
								molest the living. They are without the ability to reason, having lost contact with
								their middle selves, and are the spirits which obsess the living and render them
								insane. (There are many kinds of insane persons. Some are gentle and docile and
								dull. In asylums they sit all day doing nothing. There are also the wild and dangerous.
								Between these levels are those who are very like children, anxious to please, or
								prone to playing pranks and getting into mischief.)
							</p>
							<p>
								There are also low self spirits who stay near the here-living by choice, and many
								of them learn to touch the shadowy bodies of the living and steal vital force. If
								they can steal enough, they can solidify their shadowy bodies (even while leaving
								them invisible to us) sufficiently to enable them to move solid objects. Because
								the entire stolen charge of vital force can be used or expended in one action, they
								can perform feats of amazing strength.
							</p>
							<p>
								Harry Price of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research <sup>[1, 2]</sup> studied
								for three weeks a Roumanian girl, Eleonore Zugan <span class="note">[aka Zugun]</span>,
								who was haunted by a spirit of this kind. It was a source of much trouble, moving
								objects around the room when the girl was in it, marking her skin with peculiar
								marks and thrusting pins and needles painfully into her flesh.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">

							</p>
							<p>
								A young widow in Ohio was haunted by a poltergeist which was studied by the professors
								at a medical school which she attended. One of its feats of strength was the tearing
								away of the spindles of a strong banister, spindle by spindle as the young woman
								mounted the stairs. It threw objects and smashed things in a maliciously destructive
								way.
							</p>
							<p>
								Bed covering has been jerked from sleeping individuals very often, this seeming
								to be a favorite trick. Water has been brought and dumped over haunted persons,
								and several cases have been studied in which fire has been brought and set to bed
								or clothing or rooms of the haunted individuals &ndash; usually adolescents of a
								mediumistic nature, ones from whom vital force was easy to steal.
							</p>
							<p>
								In a few cases the poltergeists have been useful doing chores such as setting tables
								and washing dishes during the night.

							<h5>
								Vampirism
							</h5>
							<p>
								These low selves may be fairly harmless, and seem to be for the most part. On the
								other hand they are the horrid and darkly evil beings who stalk the living and prey
								on them, stealing their vital force, often to the point of complete exhaustion and
								mysterious death, or of seizing their bodies and rendering them obsessionally insane.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thousands of the living are silently and invisibly haunted in this way, by low selves
								who appear as secondary or multiple personalities. They are not "split off" parts
								of the resident selves of a body, as is the popular belief today of our psychologists.
								They are individuals in their own right.
							</p>
							<p>
								Not only do the low selves, separated from their middle selves, fasten themselves
								on the living as foreign "personalities," but middle selves separated from their
								low selves do the same to a lesser degree, and now and again a normal ghostly spirit
								composed of both low and middle selves is guilty of taking up its abode in the shadowy
								body of a living victim.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is not for nothing that the living have an instinctive fear of ghosts. They have
								always had good reason to be afraid. Dreadful things are done constantly to the
								living, with none to recognize the invisibles who are taking their life forces and,
								even worse, are implanting thought forms as suggestions into their low selves to
								cause endless erratic behavior, crimes, mischiefs and sometimes utterly vile and
								evil acts.
							</p>
							<p>
								The tradition of vampires is an ancient one. The dead were supposed to rise in the
								night from their graves and attack those who slept, making fine holes in their throats
								and draining out their blood so that they were left white and weak upon awakening.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because, through the centuries, people sometimes fell into death-like trance conditions
								and were buried for dead; and because these people were sometimes taken from the
								grave and found undecayed and with blood still fluid, the tradition was not unfounded.
								It was supposed that these people kept alive in the grave by going mysteriously
								to steal blood from the living. There are weird tales in ancient books telling how
								the dead and buried were seen and recognized as they sought to steal blood. If they
								were, they appeared as materialized ghosts, and at most could steal only vital force.
							</p>
							<p>
								While no proof of the correctness of any of these tales is to be had, they mention
								with alarming frequency the recognition of the supposed vampire ghost, by means
								of a dream or actual sight. The lapse of time between burial and disinterment has
								sometimes been given as a matter of many days, and when the body has been taken
								up and found not to be decayed, the only conclusion is that life was preserved in
								some way.
							</p>
							<p>
								In former times the blood was supposed to be the life-giving fluid. Blood found
								in the coffins of the dead may have been imaginary or caused by injuries to the
								buried individual when awakening and trying to free himself. However these things
								may be, there is the long chance that the entranced individuals, long familiar with
								vampire tales, found themselves trapped in their coffins and endeavored to keep
								alive by trying to suck blood from the living. They would be far more likely to
								absorb vital force from them, and if they could get even a little nightly supply,
								could preserve the scant life in the entranced body for a considerable period.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the Middle Ages a stake was driven through the heart and into the grave soil
								of anyone suspected of having vampire possibilities. There were other precautions
								in the way of spells, incantations and religious rites. Cremation of the dead was
								considered a very sure way of guaranteeing that they would not molest the living.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is a poorly defined thread of belief that may have been shared by the kahunas,
								that there exist beings or dark forces which have never been incarnate in fleshly
								bodies, even as there are good forces of a similar kind on a higher level &ndash;
								the Beings of Light. Nothing is actually known of either of these types, and even
								if they exist, their primary purpose could not be that of affecting the living human
								beings.
							</p>
							<p>
								A final danger remains to be considered. It is the danger of purposeful attack by
								a normal there-living person who wishes to punish a here-living person for some
								injury done a here-living loved one. Or the punishment may be in revenge for injuries
								done during life to the one who has gone across with heart filled with hatred.

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="suggestion">&nbsp;</a>
							<h5>
								Suggestion
							</h5>
							<p>
								Suggestion plays a much greater part in our lives than most of us suspect. We take
								and give suggestion in association with our families and friends each day, especially
								if there is a physical stimulus accompanying a suggestion. The anxious mother who
								calls her child to her and says, "You don't look right. Do you hurt anywhere?" and
								then feels of the child's cheeks, may implant a suggestion of illness.
							</p>
							<p>
								The normal dual low-plus-middle self departed spirit can also use suggestion, especially
								if it can get from the living a supply of vital force, and often the thought form
								used as the suggestion is taken from a living person.
							</p>
							<p>
								A kahuna, in explaining this to me a long time ago in Hawaii, stressed the danger
								of thinking and voicing any thought which might be used as a suggestion by a normal
								ghost. (A normal ghost is called kino wailua, or body of two waters, water being
								the kahuna symbol of vital force. If a ghost had two kinds of vital force it was
								composed of a low and middle self living in their interblended shadowy bodies.)
								I was warned never to say, even in fun, "He ought to be shot," or "I hope he chokes,"
								lest this thought be taken and given as a potent suggestion by some spirit enemy.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Hawaii it was not the kahunas alone who knew of this possibility. The layman
								also knew of it, and what is more, made use of it when injured and unable to get
								redress from the one who had caused the injury. The injured one made a mental or
								telepathic appeal to the spirit of some loved relative who had passed on and did
								what was called "grumbling" &ndash; a rehearsal in detail of just what had been
								done to injure him (or her).
							</p>
							<p>
								I will present two instances of this practice.

							<h4>
								<span class="block">Case 27:</span> Attacks on the Living by the Dead
							</h4>
							<h5>
								Preliminary Notes:</h5>
							<p>
								As I have explained in telling of the death prayer, a person's low self will usually
								protect itself against all marauding spirits. It usually has more of a charge of
								vital force than an attacking spirit (unless a heavily charged one sent by a kahuna),
								and because of this can repel a less heavily charged spirit. It is the low self
								in each of us which possesses what we call the psychic sensibilities, and it senses
								the presence of spirits of which we middle selves are quite unaware.
							</p>
							<p>
								If, in instances where we have a deep sense of guilt for some real or imaginary
								sin or where this guilt sense has become a complex, we are attacked by a spirit
								bent on "punishing" us by implanting a thought form of a punishing illness or accident
								or condition, our low self may meekly accept the suggestion because of its conviction
								that it deserves such punishment.
							</p>
							<p>
								This matter of the guilt complex, especially when we have actually hurt another
								and have not made restitution and gained forgiveness, and when the middle self is
								thus aware that it is guilty of a misdeed, is the weak spot in the armor. It has
								been the secret and greatly important thing known to the kahunas, but only faintly
								glimpsed and entirely misunderstood by religionists the world around. The Theosophists,
								borrowing their ideas largely from India, recognize the danger from unseen beings
								and speak of the great danger of rupturing the astral shell so that spirits can
								come through to attack.
							</p>
							<p>
								The idea of rupturing the astral or shadowy body does not explain how mediums can
								work with the spirits for years and not be obsessed. The idea also lacks inclusion
								of the part played by the vital force as well as the complex.
							</p>
							<h5>
								The Cases [A and B]:</h5>
							<p>
								(A) In Honolulu I studied a case of spirit attack involving the brother of a Chinese-Hawaiian
								friend of mine. The young man had for a sweetheart a pretty Hawaiian girl. While
								he had not proposed to her, it was taken for granted that he would do so as soon
								as his financial affairs were in such condition that he could marry.
							</p>
							<p>
								When his new business of salt making was established, his father stepped into the
								situation and demanded the customary right of a Chinese father to select a bride
								for his son. The son loved and respected his father and, although much embarrassed
								by his predicament, agreed to stop courting the Hawaiian girl and give time for
								a parental choice to be made. He knew that the Hawaiian girl would be deeply hurt
								when he broke off seeing her, but was so filled with a sense of guilt and shame
								that he did not try to go to her and explain what had happened. Undoubtedly he developed
								a guilt complex which lodged in his low self and which was shared by the middle
								self in its conviction that he had done the girl a wrong.
							</p>
							<p>
								The girl was heartbroken for a time, then fiercely angry at the treatment accorded
								her without a word of explanation. Following the tradition of her people she began
								"grumbling," calling on the spirit of a beloved grandmother to avenge the wrong.
							</p>
							<p>
								Soon the young man was overtaken by a strange malady. He would faint at unexpected
								times and without warning. He fainted and fell into a fire, burning himself painfully.
								He fainted while driving to his salt works and wrecked his car, narrowly escaping
								severe injury. He fainted and fell on his bed while smoking, setting fire to the
								bed and again burning himself. Three doctors were consulted, but none of them could
								diagnose the cause of the trouble. Almost from the first his Hawaiian mother had
								urged him to go to a kahuna, but the son was very modern and had been taught at
								school that the kahunas were superstitious impostors and nothing more.
							</p>
							<p>
								When all treatment failed, however, he did as his mother suggested. The kahuna,
								then a man well advanced in years, listened to his story, sat for a time in silence
								with his eyes closed, then raised his head and announced that he had sensed the
								spirit of an old Hawaiian woman near him, and that from her he had learned that
								the young man had been guilty of one of the worst sins of all &ndash; that of hurting
								one who loved and trusted him. The spirit of the grandmother had been doing her
								best to avenge the injury.
							</p>
							<p>
								The young man was amazed. He admitted his guilt and asked what he should do. The
								kahuna explained to him the ancient rule of the Hawaiians that no one should hurt
								another, bodily, or through theft of goods or through injury to feelings. These
								were the only sins, and for them there was but one remedy. The guilty one had to
								make amends and get the forgiveness of the injured party.
							</p>
							<p>
								Taking his leave, the young man went directly to the girl. He was met by anger and
								disdain, but he persisted doggedly in his effort to make her understand his position
								in the matter. Scornfully she refused to be pacified. The next day he returned with
								gifts and more apologies, and the next day and the next. At last his pleas broke
								down the girl's anger and aroused her sympathy. She forgave him and agreed to go
								with him to the old kahuna to acknowledge her forgiveness.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahuna seemed to be expecting them. He praised the girl for her kindness, called
								to the spirit of the grandmother to observe that the wrong had been righted and
								forgiveness obtained. He thanked the spirit for having done so well in forcing justice
								to be done, and asked her to cease her attack. When she agreed to his request, he
								took a spray of ti leaves and sea water, sprinkled the girl and the air where the
								spirit stood, and spoke the words of the kala or forgiveness with suggestive power.
								Then dismissing the girl and the spirit, he turned to the young man, explaining
								that the kala (to bring back the "light") or cleansing for him was a more difficult
								matter.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because he had been guilty and because his sense of guilt had made it possible for
								the spirit to place thoughts of fainting in his mind when she pleased, the punishment
								might even now be continued by his own low self (unihipili) unless it was well cleansed.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the cleansing or forgiving ceremony he would have to use a very powerful and
								effective ritual &ndash; one which could not fail to cure the fainting forever.
								He brought an egg, holding it long in both his hands and chanting a little as he
								commanded healing and forgiving power to enter the egg.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the work of filling the egg with vital force was finished, he stood the young
								man before him and ordered him to hold his breath as long as he could. When he could
								hold it no longer he was to put out his hand. In his hand would be placed a china
								cup into which the kahuna would have broken the raw egg while the breath was being
								held. Without drawing breath the young man was to gulp down the egg. At the same
								time the words of forgiveness would be spoken and, reinforced by the egg and the
								power in it, would effect the complete cleansing and cure.
							</p>
							<p>
								The instructions were followed to the letter. The kahuna gave the suggestion of
								forgiving and of dispelling the guilt and fainting attacks. He continued the suggestions,
								rubbing the young man's stomach briskly after he had swallowed the egg and begun
								once more to breathe. The kahuna announced the complete success of the cure, warned
								the patient to forget the whole affair as soon as possible, and accepted graciously
								his fee for his work.
							</p>
							<p>
								I investigated this case and checked all the details of the healing treatment. I
								also kept in touch with my young friend for several years following. Never once
								did the fainting attacks return.
							</p>
							<p>
								(B) Another case which I studied closely was one involving a young married couple,
								their infant daughter and the husband's mother, all Hawaiians.
							</p>
							<p>
								The husband, an only son, had promised that his first child, if a girl, should be
								named for his mother. Some time later, when the baby girl was born, he had forgotten
								his promise or chosen to neglect it because his wife had already begun calling the
								child by a name of her selection.

								The child's grandmother was much disappointed. Then, as her son and daughter-in-law
								became engaged in their own affairs and came to see her only at longer and longer
								intervals, she gradually became hotly resentful.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the neglect continued, she began grumbling to her departed relatives, asking
								that her son and daughter-in-law be forced to end their neglect.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the kahuna who eventually handled the tangle later explained, the young couple
								were not aware that they had hurt the feelings of the husband's mother. They were
								just very busy. They had no sense of guilt. The spirits in trying to attack and
								punish them to bring them to time were unable to do so because of the lack of a
								guilt sense. The baby, however, they found to be vulnerable and each day they took
								from it some of its vital force. It weakened, became more and more ill, and failed
								to respond to medical treatment.
							</p>
							<p>
								The baby, still not two years old, was taken to the Children's Hospital in Honolulu.
								It grew steadily weaker, and one day they were warned that death was impending.
							</p>
							<p>
								Greatly alarmed and desperate, the young parents took the child from the hospital
								and carried her in the early evening to the home of three old Hawaiians, all kahunas
								of different degrees of ability, and all accustomed to practice together. Of these
								three two were women, the third a man. He was the most psychic and was called the
								makaula or "eye."
							</p>
							<p>
								No time was lost. The old man brought a primitive crystal gazing outfit consisting
								of a small gourd calabash in which was placed a little water and a smooth, rounded
								black stone. The water was swished periodically over the stone to give it a dark
								reflecting surface in which psychic images appeared to the old man as he worked
								to diagnose the cause of the illness.
							</p>
							<p>
								The two old women brought a warm decoction of ti leaf water and began bathing the
								baby, taking turns placing their hands on her and making an old chant of restoration.
								(Such chants are very old and often very beautifully worded and rhymed in the native
								tongue.) The baby had suffered an attack of convulsions before being taken from
								the hospital and had been crying weakly. She grew quiet and fell asleep.
							</p>
							<p>
								The old man finished his work and rose stiffly from the darkened corner where he
								had been on all fours gazing into the calabash in the traditional manner. He announced
								that he had "fished" in all directions (the reference to the threads of aka substance
								running here and there in all directions from the patient, and followed to find
								those who might be associated with him. These threads were also referred to as "fish
								lines"). He had seen some spirits who were angry and a very angry old woman in the
								flesh whom he took to be a grandmother of the baby. He asked a few questions to
								confirm his finding, and gave it as his decision that the grandmother had been hurt
								and had grumbled with the result that the baby had been attacked.
							</p>
							<p>
								The young husband was certain that there must be a mistake and that his mother could
								not have been guilty of such a bad thing, but was hustled out of the house with
								impatient commands to go fetch his mother at all costs. He hurried to her and found,
								to his consternation, that the kahuna was right. She railed at him and was quieted
								only when he managed to tell her that the baby had suffered punishment, and not
								himself or his wife. It had not been her wish to have the baby hurt, and &ndash;
								tearfully repentant &ndash; she hurried to accompany her son to the home of the
								kahunas.
							</p>
							<p>
								The old man, his crystal now set aside, questioned the grandmother, learning of
								her injured feeling and grumbling. He scolded her roundly, scolded the young couple
								even more, and called the spirits and inquired what they thought should be done
								by the young parents to make amends. It was unanimously agreed that the child should
								be named for the grandmother, and that she no longer be neglected. Amidst Hawaiian
								tears and laughter forgiveness was asked and given. The old man perfunctorily sprinkled
								everyone including the spirits, but not the sleeping baby, spoke words of cleansing,
								and warned that the trouble should not be remembered &ndash; but, if remembered
								by accident, a prayer should immediately be made for forgiveness lest some guilt
								"get inside" and cause trouble.
							</p>
							<p>
								The baby made an almost miraculous recovery and soon grew plump and strong. She
								remained well and fine, as did the young parents until the time I left the Islands
								and lost touch with them.

								Comment:</h5>
							<p>
								In these two cases can be seen the use of suggestion and a physical stimulus. The
								holding of the breath with the swallowing of a raw egg highly charged with vital
								force, and accompanied by suggestions to remove the complex and cause healing, could
								hardly be more clearly demonstrated.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the case of the child, not yet two years old, suggestion could hardly have played
								a part, so the objection often met in the Islands, that all kahuna magic resulted
								from suggestion, does not apply. That a baby can be so attacked illustrates the
								grave nature of the danger of spirit attack. To be safe and to keep children safe,
								all precautions should be taken not to hurt the feelings of others if at all possible
								to avoid doing so. If it is imperative that something be done or said that will
								hurt another, it is equally imperative that the reason for the word or act be fully
								explained and all reasons given ahead of time. Frequently it is better to be long
								suffering rather than hurt the feelings of one who is not very capable of reasoning
								things out.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Hawaiians of yesterday, reared in the old traditions, took great care to hurt
								no one. They went out of their way to prevent jealousy or envy. To this end they
								shared their worldly goods in a most prodigal way. The result was a community noted
								for kindliness and hospitality.<br />
								<br />
								THE TREATMENT OF THE INSANE falls under two main headings. First, of the obsessionally
								insane, and second, of the insane whose brain tissues are injured, diseased or abnormal.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the brain is not normal at birth, the low spirit can function in the child but
								not the conscious or middle spirit. The low self cannot learn except as an animal
								learns. It remains unable even to use the low self's deductive reason, and so remains
								idiotic.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas believed that the seat of the "mind" of the low self was in the shadowy
								body of the low self, and that this "mind" was in touch with a similar "mind" belonging
								to the middle self and seated in the shadowy body of the middle self. Both these
								minds usually keep in touch when the two spirits of a man leave the body during
								sleep or trance conditions. After death the two selves in their two interblended
								shadowy bodies leave the physical body. Earth memories, beliefs, complexes and ideas
								are stored in the shadowy body of the low self, so are taken along at death.
							</p>
							<p>
								Normally, the two selves use the body and its organs, the shadowy bodies penetrating
								and blending with all organic parts, including the brain, the nerve centers, and
								the nerves. If some of the brain centers or nerve tissues are lacking or become
								diseased, the selves cannot function through them. This is particularly true in
								cases in which the brain tissues used by the middle self are injured by sickness
								or accident. The middle self, finding itself unable to function through its part
								of the body, becomes an outcast and leaves to wander about in the invisible levels.
								The low self, however, may be able to continue to live on in the uninjured parts
								of the body.
							</p>
							<p>
								The asylums hold many insane persons of this class. The middle self is easily driven
								out of the body through a temporary or permanent injury to its nervous centers.
								Toxins from bad teeth or from disease may cause the middle self to leave, but the
								low self is able to function almost as usual. With teeth pulled or diseases treated,
								the middle self frequently resumes its residence in the body and sanity returns.
							</p>
							<p>
								The low and middle selves may both be dislodged from the body by some abnormal condition
								or accident, and an obsessing spirit may take the body and hold it. Or the obsessing
								low spirit may gain possession of the body only at intervals, in which case the
								patient is said to suffer from "split personality."
							</p>
							<p>
								In obsessional insanity the patient may be considered a victim of complete or reciprocal
								amnesia if the obsessing is done by a normal spirit made up of combined low and
								middle selves. When such a spirit drives out the rightful owner of the body and
								takes possession, it brings with it (stored in its own low shadowy body) the memories
								of another life in a body, and it brings also its own middle self and its characteristic
								reasoning powers. These cases are not typical of insanity because the obsessing
								pair of spirits is quite normal and sane.

								Ansel Bourne
							</div>
							<p>
								The famous case of Anselm Bourne <sup>[3]</sup> is a good example. This man suddenly
								changed personalities and memories. He left his home to go to the home he remembered,
								and, as he thought himself to be a storekeeper and his name Albert John Brown, he
								eventually arrived at Norristown, Pa., and opened a small store.</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[3. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Bourne">en.wikipedia.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />Ansel_Bourne</a>
								]
							</p>
							<p>
								In a short time the original selves managed to get possession of the body and the
								man awakened to find himself in strange surroundings of which he knew nothing. He
								was able to return to his home in Providence, R. I. There he was treated by a pair
								of famous psychologists. <span class="note">[William James and Richard Hodgson]</span>
								They hypnotized him, and under hypnosis were able to get the obsessing spirit to
								talk to them through the body, and give in detail all the things it had done while
								the body was in its possession.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because the spirits who elect to remain close to some living person and steal a
								little vital force, if not able to steal the whole body, can often be called to
								enter the body and speak through hypnotic conditions, it has been thought that such
								spirits were split off parts of the original personality. When, through the repeated
								use of hypnotic suggestion, such obsession-bent personalities are forced to obey
								such suggestions as, "Unite with the main personality," there results a most amazing
								situation in which each patient is unlike any other. The main result is that the
								obsessing spirit, if a low entity and not a combined low-middle invader, can be
								brought under control of the resident middle self. This gradually results in the
								person having the memories of both low selves. In one case treated by Dr. Prince,
								a girl who was periodically obsessed by an invading spirit was enabled to recall
								the memories of what she had done while obsessed, and for this reason it was decided
								that her personality had been reunited.
							</p>
							<p>
								When there is obsession by a middle self alone, there is a change in temperament
								and likes and dislikes, but not of memories. A dull and sluggish girl was so obsessed
								in the case of Dr. Azam's patient, Felida X. This girl was dull and sickly when
								normal. When under control of the invading "personality" (undoubtedly a middle self)
								she was gay, intelligent, energetic and well. The obsessional changes took place
								every five or six days at first, then the obsessing spirit began to hold the body
								for longer and longer periods until it finally kept the body all the time. As the
								change improved the girl in every way, it was welcomed by the parents. Dr. Fodor,
								in telling of this case, is careful to point out the important fact that in this
								instance, "the memory in the secondary state was continuous." This tells us that
								the low self of the girl remained constantly in the body and only the middle self
								changed.
							</p>
							<p>
								MODERN TREATMENT of the insane centers around the task of restoring normal health
								conditions if insanity has been brought on through illness or disease. In the ever
								increasing percentage of obsessionally insane, classed by the doctors as sufferers
								from some form of "split off personality" or schizophrenia, the obsessing is done
								by a low self while the resident middle self is either driven from the body, or
								unable to control the invading low self. The characteristic thing in these cases
								is the loss of normal memories, showing that the original low self is displaced.
								There is another characteristic which points directly to a low self being involved.
								This is the tendency in this form of insanity to live in a dream or imaginary world,
								paying little or no heed to physical surroundings. Loved ones are not recognized
								except in the so-called "lucid" periods when the obsessing spirit may temporarily
								depart and the normal spirit return.
							</p>
							<p>
								The treatment by hypnotic suggestion has long been regarded as a failure. The insane
								will not pay attention and seem to reject all hypnotic suggestion. This is natural
								for the reason that the low self or obsessing spirit has its own sets of beliefs
								and wishes, and suggestions contrary to these are rejected.
							</p>
							<p>
								The insulin and electric shock methods of driving out the obsessing spirit or spirits
								has been the most successful treatment yet discovered. If the pain produced by shock
								methods is sufficiently great, the obsessing spirit will leave, and &ndash; as it
								is not logical &ndash; it will be unable to understand the treatment and will conclude
								that the body will always be a painful place in which to reside. With the pain gone,
								the original spirits of the patient can return.
							</p>
							<p>
								THE KAHUNA METHOD OF TREATMENT of the obsessionally insane made use of the shock
								method of dislodging obsessing low entities. The shock was produced by accumulating
								large quantities of vital force in the body of the healer and transferring it to
								that of the insane patient with the willed command that the invader be rendered
								helpless and thrown out of the stolen body.
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahunas frequently used their psychic powers to sense the presence of the normal
								spirits of the patient and instruct them to stand by to take over the body once
								the invader had been put out. The help of the departed was also frequently asked
								for and obtained. A good normal person among the there-living could absorb large
								charges of vital force from the living and, thus greatly strengthened in will and
								in its shadowy bodies, could control the obsessing spirit once it had been put out
								of the body. Under control, it was often worked over to team it up with a middle
								self which had lost its companion low self &ndash; possibly the middle self with
								which it had formerly lived in a body before being separated in some way. (The rejoining
								of a low to a middle self in this way was a very good thing as it removed the danger
								of further obsessing activities on the part of the illogical and uncontrolled low
								self.)
							</p>
							<p>
								The kahuna shock method in which vital force is used as the shock-producing agent,
								has the advantage of forcing the obsessing low self to accept a thought form as
								a suggestion. The thought form here is that of withdrawing from the stolen body.
								Because of complexed and related fixations held by the obsessing low self, the powerful
								suggestion was not always accepted and acted upon, although the theory was that,
								given a sufficiently large charge of shocking force, the suggestion would break
								down and replace all contrary thought forms held by the obsessing spirit.
							</p>
							<p>
								While we have not yet taken up in detail the healing methods which involve the aid
								of the High Self, it may be said that it was believed that no human ill could be
								beyond the power of the High Self to heal. The High Self was especially able in
								handling obsessing low selves.
							</p>
							<p>
								The fact has been a part of religious knowledge the world around and for many centuries.
								When evil influences were sensed near or were suspected, the Christian crossed himself
								and prayed through Jesus to the Father. In India the rite took the form of intoning
								the sacred "Om," and in other parts of the world similar ritualistic appeals to
								Higher Beings was made. Charms and amulets were worn and were clutched while prayers
								for protection were made. While imagined dangers grew to outweigh by a thousandfold
								the real danger, the practice was basically sound in that a High Self was called
								upon for help and a physical stimulus was used in the form of the ritual crossing
								or intonation, holding of cross or amulet, etc., to cause the suppliant's low self
								to carry the prayer to his High Self.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most of the low selves against whom protective measures need to be taken have fixed
								fears of the Higher Beings, these fears being carried as memories from their lives
								in the physical. If they were the low selves of a Christian man or woman, they would
								believe in God and Jesus, and when confronted with their dark deeds and a prayer
								and cross, would depart in fear. A man whom I am proud to list among my friends,
								Bishop James, of London, used the Christian ritual of exorcism very effectively
								to drive horrid things from haunted houses and palaces throughout Europe.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some of the horrid things appear to be the low selves of savage men who lived in
								the physical thousands of years ago. (Such traditions can be found today in any
								of the older and more crowded countries where for many years human life and civilizations
								have existed.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Not long ago, in letters from England, I had the story of one such spirit attaching
								itself to a small boy in the south of that country, at the time that the boy found
								a peculiar bright pebble on a beach. The lad was sufficiently psychic to see the
								shadowy body of the dwarfed old savage, and amused himself by playing with him and
								trying to converse by means of hand signs. In time the spirit grew too bothersome
								in its constant demand for attention, appearing at any time or place and trying
								to attract attention, constantly touching the boy with its ghostly hands.
							</p>
							<p>
								The boy had a friend who also could see the little old man in his tattered skin
								garment. The friend was given the stone as a gift, and the spirit with it. Soon
								the second boy was partly obsessed by the spirit, the obsession periods growing
								longer each time they came. Doctors failed to get to the bottom of the trouble but
								a clergyman of the Church of England, of exceptional psychological knowledge and
								with more than a smattering of knowledge of kahuna lore, learned of the case and
								undertook to drive away the old spirit.
							</p>
							<p>
								The exorcism of the church was only temporarily helpful. He thereupon engaged the
								help of some psychic friends, and the impression was received that if he would add
								to the Church ritual of exorcism the determined use of his will to force the spirit
								into a glass bottle (using everything he knew of self-protection against the spirit,
								to repel any attempt it might make to obsess him) and then throw the bottle and
								the pebble back into the sea, the case would be closed.
							</p>
							<p>
								The clergyman used full ritual of the church to purify his surroundings, the place
								where he stood, and his own person, and called upon the spirit to leave the stone
								and approach. The old spirit came in a peculiar way, appearing as a wisp of pale
								vapor oozing across the floor, to the feet of the clergyman &ndash; who felt the
								typical sensation of crawling chill at its touch. He at once began to give hypnotic
								suggestion to force the spirit into the bottle he held. The chill rose along the
								legs and then was felt no longer. A medium who was present said that she could see
								the spirit obeying all orders, finally disappearing into the bottle. The bottle
								was sealed and thrown with the pebble into the sea. The treatment was effective,
								and neither boy was bothered again. At a later time it was reported psychically
								that the old savage seemed to be in some way tied to the pebble, and that it was
								through the pebble that it was able to contact and obsess the boys.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is highly probable that certain objects treasured in life by the living become
								fixation centers for them after death. (I have heard of many such cases.) It is
								also probable that when the living handle such objects they vitalize with vital
								force the ancient threads of shadowy body stuff connecting the object to its former
								owner and attracting them to the living. It is evident that in handling the pebble
								the boys made such a contact with the savage and made it possible for him to draw
								vital force from them. Strengthened by this vital force, and attracted to the levels
								of the living, he tried to steal a body.
							</p>
							<p>
								These cases all stress the evidence which points to the fact that low selves on
								the other side of life are held over great periods of time by their fixed thoughts
								which have been carried across with them after physical death. If they have been
								separated from their logical middle selves, they cannot use reason to learn of their
								condition or to progress. They remain "earth bound" indeed, not understanding the
								significance of the change death of the body has brought to them, and anxious to
								get back into a living body to continue the life they knew.
							</p>
							<p>
								We, as civilized men, face another danger in that the insane are fed and housed,
								and only infrequently treated by insulin or other shock methods. This forms an open
								invitation to lingering horrid things out of the great past to obsess the living.
								It is not like it was in ancient days when "mad men" were stoned to death if violent,
								or left to starve after being driven out of the communities of the sane. This treatment
								was inhuman, but it was not an invitation to happy obsession in bodies which are
								fed, housed and cared for in the modern way.
							</p>
							<p>
								Of course, we will not return to cruelty in these matters, but will come to a better
								understanding of the forces with which we have to deal, and learn more adequate
								methods of treating the insane.<br />
								<br />
								From the foregoing it will be seen again how great a light is thrown on the dark
								places in our knowledge of ourselves by the lore of the kahunas.
