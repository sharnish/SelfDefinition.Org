                                In actual practice it is anticipated that some individuals will excel in the work
                                of calling down the actual healing action from the Aumakua. Others may be unable
                                to do this, but will be able to get patients ready for the actual healing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All experimenters will usually try to learn the simple movements of mind first,
                                but will, at the same time remember the necessity of working toward the end of contact
                                with the Aumakua.
                            </p>

                                Experimenters with mediumistic ability will sometimes be needed to work with the
                                less psychic members. It is probable that in cases of obsession, or attack by angry
                                spirits from "the other side", the psychic members will enlist the help of their
                                spirit guides to "see" the spirit causing the trouble, and to watch progressive
                                results when exorcism is attempted by other healers. This is a special branch of
                                the work and will be in the hands of those especially qualified to undertake it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Obsession and the various degrees of "split personality" are accounted for by the
                                Huna system (as it stands at this writing) in fair detail, but the study must be
                                continued in this branch with experimentation helping to feel the way. It is clear
                                that the low and middle selves are often separated from each other at death, and
                                that, singly, they may attach themselves as "split personalities" to the living,
                                or may completely obsess an individual. If there is amnesia in which a new and different
                                set of memories arrive, it can be assumed that the Aunihipili has been displaced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Only this self can remember and store memories in its shadowy body. If there is
                                a change in "personality" but not in memories, only a Auhane has been displaced.
                                If both personality and memory are seen to change, there is a full exchange of selves
                                in the body. Frequently the Auhane is forced to leave the body because of disease
                                or injury, while the Aunihipili remains caring for the body and remembering, but
                                with no Auhane there is no inductive or higher reason, so the insane patient is
                                "irrational".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In cases where there is this irrational type of insanity, and/or a complete loss
                                of earlier memories, it would appear to be a definite matter of the human low and
                                middle selves abandoning a body (or being ousted from it in some way) and the body
                                falling into the possession of something which may (1) be subhuman, or (2) may be
                                a very young or injured human Aunihipili. Mediums (and even the insane themselves,
                                when recovering or when their obsession begins) describe seeing these obsessing
                                spirits. Some are distorted or grotesque or dwarfed, some blind, some with features
                                hardly human.

                                The Huna system presents a theory of evolution in which units of consciousness evolve
                                upward step by step from the group units of rocks and waters, through the vegetable
                                kingdom, to Insects, birds and animals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Man has his three selves or separate spirits, and each learns the lessons of its
                                level and then Graduates into the next level above. As an illustration we may call
                                the Aunihipili a first grade student, the Auhane a second grader, and the Aumakua
                                a third grader. Each self is associated with the self next above it in the triune
                                man. In this way the Auhane trains the Aunihipili so that it eventually is ready
                                to become the Auhane of a savage, and, when Graduation time comes, is born into
                                a savage body. It is then a Auhane and is ready to begin learning, through several
                                lives, the use of inductive reason. In this new savage body there is a new Aunihipili
                                which has just graduated from the animal kingdom. It may have been the self in a
                                very intelligent pet dog, and it begins its schooling under the new Auhane. With
                                and above them is a Aumakua who, according to Huna, has not just graduated into
                                that level, but who has been taking a long training in being the oversoul of the
                                lower kingdoms, perhaps as a group soul. (This group soul idea is not greatly important
                                to practical work, but is very interesting.) The Aumakua is called "the trustworthy
                                parental self," and is supposed to have to demonstrate its trustworthiness before
                                undertaking the supervision of human Aunihipili and Auhane selves.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From this school of selves there are those who "play hookey." By accident or otherwise the Aunihipili and Auhane selves sometimes get separated at the time of death, or when insanity is caused by disease or injury and the Auhane is forced out of the body. The low selves, when alone and not supervised by a Auhane, on "the other side" are given to efforts to get back into a body as parts of "split personalities," or as obsessing spirits. They attend seances and pretend to be normal two-self ghosts, They can read the minds and memories of sitters and will pretend to be a dead friend or relative, even some famous historical character. They are unable to use inductive reason and, while usually as friendly as a stray dog trying to find a new master, eagerly say what they think the sitter would like to hear. Frequently they are very hard to recognize for what they are, and the bright banner of Spiritualism has been besmirched by their lack of logic, lies, and trickery.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A most surprising situation is sometimes found in instances where the Aunihipili
                                of some advanced individual has, after or before the time of physical death, in
                                some way learned to contact the Aumakua and present to it both a thought form prayer
                                and a flow of vital force. (Here we see another evidence of the Aumakua's almost
                                automatic response to this stimulus.) This Aunihipili has the memories of its past
                                life and so does not forget the mechanism it has learned to use. It is, however,
                                irrational and childish. It first finds a living person from which it can steal
                                vital force, usually an adolescent boy or girl, and then gets into mischief. It
                                makes its prayers and becomes more than the ordinary poltergeist (who merely uses
                                stolen vital force to break or throw things). It becomes the super-poltergeist who
                                can get fire-immunity, or who can apport fire or water or stones, or do other things.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Italy in recent years a child and her grandmother were bothered by such a spirit.
                                Fire was constantly being kindled near them or in their beds or clothing. In other
                                cases water was apported and used to drench the victims of the joke at odd times.
                                In France paving bricks were apported and hurled in a stream at a certain house
                                for some days and nights. They were apported through the roof and fell thudding
                                inside the rooms, but they were dematerialized as swiftly, so the piles of stones
                                never grew high. Similar cases of stone throwing have been reported from, the wilds
                                of Malaya and Java.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is evident however, that the Aumakua exercises some control over such performances,
                                because no permanent injury is done those upon whom the tricks are played. (If a
                                Aunihipili is using stolen vital force without contact with its Aumakua, it may
                                move objects and sometimes come very near to injuring the living.) The Aumakua allows
                                us far more use of free will than the average parent allows a child.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the animal world free will is allowed on a grand scale and animal eats animal,
                                but the evolution of the units of consciousness is not greatly delayed. There are
                                always fresh bodies to enter. Instincts, however, rule the lower kingdoms and in
                                obeying the instincts little free will is allowed. Birds build nests after certain
                                set patterns and in season fly north or south. There is order behind the seeming
                                confusion caused by the evolution upwards toward the stage when a complete free
                                will can be obtained. This final achievement may come after graduation from the
                                Aumakua level, our minds are unable to reach that far and so we cannot be sure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are going to make the effort to learn to use Huna, and regain the direct help
                                of the Aumakua and its associates of its high level. It is very important that we
                                come to know as much as possible of the actions of the Aumakua in the production
                                of psychic phenomena, especially physical phenomena. Spirits who attend seances
                                are not always what we should expect them to have become before they could contact,
                                and gain the help of, the Aumakua. The spirit, known as John King, was given to
                                boasting that he had been a murderous pirate in life. He was a rowdy who was not
                                even slightly sanctimonious. His morals might well have been suspect. But, like
                                the Aunihipili super-poltergeists just discussed, he was able to get Aumakua help
                                upon request and produce exciting phenomena.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nearly all the phenomena of Psychic Science (excepting premonitions, ghostly appearances
                                and the like) have been produced by spirits who are able to contact a living medium
                                and use her vital force or that of a circle. A very few of these spirits are able
                                to produce physical phenomena, (apports, materialization, etc.,) but those must
                                have learned in some haphazard way to touch the Aumakua and present the right thought
                                forms, with vital force sufficient to get phenomena produced.

                                The point is that none of these spirits know Huna. They have all tried more or less
                                to answer the questions of the living as to how they produce the phenomena. Their
                                answers have been as impractical (and often as illogical) as those given by living
                                psychical researchers. In a hundred years of speculation not a single theory has
                                been put forward which would furnish an acceptable explanation of more than a few
                                simple items in psychic phenomena. In offering a general theory that covers the
                                field except for the mechanisms of a few still dark corners, Huna promises to break
                                the stalemate that has stopped Psychic Science for three decades. The same can be
                                said of our badly stalemated Psychology and its allied sciences.

                                Religion has been stalemated for some time, the older forms for many centuries,
                                and the newer forms which included modern psychological discoveries (New Thought,
                                Christian Science, Unity, etc.) for about as long as Psychology and Psychic Science
                                have been bogged down.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the new religious forms, the mechanisms and theories of Huna were partly, if
                                indistinctly, grasped, with the result that instances of healing body or circumstances
                                are frequently recorded. Here we find much evidence of the fact that Huna, in white
                                hands (the darker races are naturally more psychic, which is an advantage in some
                                practices) will work. If so much has been done with such incomplete knowledge, a
                                vastly greater accomplishment should be made possible now that we have more complete
                                understanding of elements and mechanisms.

                                We should soon be producing the desirable phenomena of the seance room without calling
                                on the spirits of the dead for help and without the need for a medium. We will endeavor
                                to use the circle as a source of vital force, each sitter donating a little, and
                                the leader of the group creating the thought forms of the "prayer," making touch
                                with the Aumakua, and getting its assistance (and that of its fellows) in healing
                                projects.

                                In England, during World War II, an experimental group endeavored to use Huna methods
                                through the ritual of the Church to open the doors of heaven and invite the Poe
                                Aumakua <span class="note">[or po'e
                                    aumakua]</span> to take a hand in ordering affairs in the world. Unfortunately, it is impossible
                                to know whether fortuitous turns in the struggle were aided or caused by such efforts.
                                It was a splendid gamble and, considering the world situation since the war, might
                                well be undertaken on a large scale lest the free will allowed us on this level
                                bring us to ultimate social or even physical disaster,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We do not know to what extent we can depend upon the Universal Associate High Selves
                                (or Beings above that) to help us work out a social system which will provide justice,
                                freedom, and an order in which we help one another instead of competing selfishly
                                and with the fierceness of the animal kingdom. The English group tried to call for
                                the prophesied "World Judgment" to balance race injustices, no matter which races
                                were found at fault and caused to pay a price for bettered world conditions. We
                                can be safe in saying that, for a beginning effort the experimental groups, when
                                organized to work on a large scale, cannot go wrong in formulating a "prayer" envisioning
                                reforms which would tally with the Golden Rule. Even the negative version, "Do not
                                unto others'" would be a great tool if we could use it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later, as this study of Huna progresses, every effort must be made to see whether
                                or not we can get from the Poe Aumakua glimpse of a perfect plan for a world social
                                organization, or, failing that, help in form ulating a plan of our own which we
                                can perfect in the course of time.

                                The Huna lore of old pointed to normal living as the great criterion. Each living
                                thing was thought to be in its intended stage of evolution, and there was sufficient
                                time for all to grow upward. Family life was good. All normal living was good. There
                                was no doctrine of asceticism and self-denial. There was plenty of time to grow
                                to the stage where, Graduation into the next level of consciousness was due.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is in strong contrast with certain dogmas which crept into Christianity and
                                other early religions. The contrast needs to be stressed. All of us cannot "sell
                                all and give to the poor," else we would have nothing but poor beggars. All of us
                                cannot leave friends and families and take the yellow robe and beggars' bowl of
                                Buddhism. All of us cannot become hermits living half starved in caves hoping to
                                find God. The practice, so common in India, of leaving friends and family at forty
                                and retiring to monastic life in order to "see God," is not justified in Huna. In
                                Huna one teaches or helps or heals, each according to his ability, even when he
                                has come to be able to touch the Aumakua, whether once in a long time, or at will.
