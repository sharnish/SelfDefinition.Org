									III. 48. <i>tû surat nain nihâr</i></p>
								<p>
									Open your eyes of love, and see Him who pervades this world! Consider it well, and
									know that this is your own country.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you meet the true Guru, He will awaken your heart; He will tell you the secret
									of love and detachment, and then you will know indeed that He transcends this universe.
								</p>
								<p>
									This world is the City of Truth, its maze of paths enchants the heart. We can reach
									the goal without crossing the road, such is the sport unending. Where the ring of
									manifold joys ever dances about Him, there is the sport of Eternal Bliss. When we
									know this, then all our receiving and renouncing is over; Thenceforth the heat of
									having shall never scorch us more.</p>
								<p>
									He is the Ultimate Rest unbounded. He has spread His form of love throughout all
									the world.
								</p>
								<p>
									From that Ray which is Truth, streams of new forms are perpetually springing; and
									He pervades those forms.
								</p>
								<p>
									All the gardens and groves and bowers are abounding with blossom; and the air breaks
									forth into ripples of joy. There the swan plays a wonderful game, There the Unstruck
									Music eddies around the Infinite One; There in the midst the Throne of the Unheld
									is shining, whereon the great Being sits.
								</p>
								<p>
									Millions of suns are shamed by the radiance of a single hair of His body.
								</p>
								<p>
									On the harp of the road what true melodies are being sounded! and its notes pierce
									the heart; There the Eternal Fountain is playing its endless life-streams of birth
									and death.
								</p>
								<p>
									They call Him Emptiness who is the Truth of truths, in Whom all truths are stored!
									<!-- VERSE 76 IN ENGLISH << this is end of VERSE 75 IN SPANISH -->
									<!-- HERE BEGINS VERSE 76 IN SPANISH -->
									There, within Him, creation goes forward, which is beyond all philosophy; for philosophy
									cannot attain to Him.
								</p>
								<p>
									There is an endless world, O my Brother! and there is the Nameless Being, of whom
									naught can be said. Only he knows it who has reached that region; it is other than
									all that is heard and said. No form, no body, no length, no breadth is seen there;
									how can I tell you that which it is?
								</p>
								<p>
									He comes to the Path of the Infinite on whom the grace of the Lord descends; he
									is freed from births and deaths who attains to Him.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "It cannot be told by the words of the mouth, it cannot be written on
									paper; It is like a dumb person who tastes a sweet thing&mdash;how shall it be explained?"</p>

								<p>
									O my heart! let us go to that country where dwells the Beloved, the ravisher of
									my heart!
								</p>
								<p>
									There Love is filling her pitcher from the well, yet she has no rope wherewith to
									draw water; There the clouds do not cover the sky, yet the rain falls down in gentle
									showers.
								</p>
								<p>
									O bodiless one! Do not sit on your doorstep; go forth and bathe yourself in that
									rain! There it is ever moonlight and never dark; and who speaks of one sun only?
									That land is illuminate with the rays of a million suns.</p>

									III. 63. <i>kahain Kabîr, s'uno ho sâdho</i></p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "O Sadhu! hear my deathless words. If you want your own good, examine
									and consider them well.
								</p>
								<p>
									You have estranged yourself from the Creator, of whom you have sprung; you have
									lost your reason, you have bought death.
								</p>
								<p>
									All doctrines and all teachings are sprung from Him, from Him they grow. Know this
									for certain, and have no fear.
								</p>
								<p>
									Hear from me the tidings of this great truth!
								</p>
								<p>
									Whose name do you sing, and on whom do you meditate? O, come forth from this entanglement!
									He dwells at the heart of all things, so why take refuge in empty desolation?
								</p>
								<p>
									If you place the Guru at a distance from you, then it is but the distance that you
									honour. If indeed the Master be far away, then who is it else that is creating this
									world?
								</p>
								<p>
									When you think that He is not here, then you wander further and further away, and
									seek Him in vain with tears. Where He is far off, there He is unattainable; where
									He is near, He is very bliss.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Lest His servant should suffer pain He pervades him through and through."
								</p>
								<p>
									Know yourself then, O Kabîr; for He is in you from head to foot. Sing with gladness,
									and keep your seat unmoved within your heart.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									LXXIX</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									III. 66. <i>nâ main dharmî nahîn adharmî</i></p>
								<p>
									I am neither pious nor ungodly, I live neither by law nor by sense,
								</p>
								<p>
									I am neither a speaker nor hearer, I am neither a servant nor master, I am neither
									bond nor free, I am neither detached nor attached.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am far from none; I am near to none. I shall go neither to hell nor to heaven.
									I do all works; yet I am apart from all works.
								</p>
								<p>
									Few comprehend my meaning; he who can comprehend it, he sits unmoved.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr seeks neither to establish nor to destroy.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									LXXX</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									III. 69. <i>satta nâm hai sab ten nyârâ</i></p>
								<p>
									The true Name is like none other name!
								</p>
								<p>
									The distinction of the Conditioned from the Unconditioned is but a word. The Unconditioned
									is the seed, the Conditioned is the flower and the fruit. Knowledge is the branch,
									and the Name is the root.
								</p>
								<p>
									Look, and see where the root is; happiness shall be yours when you come to the root.
									The root will lead you to the branch, the leaf, the flower, and the fruit.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is the encounter with the Lord, it is the attainment of bliss, it is the reconciliation
									of the Conditioned and the Unconditioned.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									LXXXI</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									III. 74. <i>pratham ek jo âpai âp</i></p>
								<p>
									In the beginning was He alone, sufficient unto Himself: the formless, colourless,
									and unconditioned Being.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then was there neither beginning, middle, nor end; Then were no eyes, no darkness,
									no light; Then were no ground, air, nor sky; no fire, water, nor earth; no rivers
									like the Ganges and the Jumna, no seas, oceans, and waves. Then was neither vice
									nor virtue; scriptures there were not, as the Vedas and Puranas, nor as the Koran.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr ponders in his mind and says, "Then was there no activity: the Supreme Being
									remained merged in the unknown depths of His own self."
								</p>
								<p>
									The Guru neither eats nor drinks, neither lives nor dies; Neither has He form, line,
									colour, nor vesture.
								</p>
								<p>
									He who has neither caste nor clan nor anything else&mdash;how may I describe His
									glory? He has neither form nor formlessness, He has no name, He has neither colour
									nor colourlessness, He has no dwelling-place.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									LXXXII</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									III. 76. <i>kahain Kabîr vicâr ke</i></p>
								<p>
									Kabîr ponders and says: "He who has neither caste nor country, who is formless and
									without quality, fills all space."
								</p>
								<p>
									The Creator brought into being the Game of Joy; and from the word Om the Creation
									sprang.
								</p>
								<p>
									The earth is His joy; His joy is the sky; His joy is the flashing of the sun and
									the moon; His joy is the beginning, the middle, and the end; His joy is eyes, darkness,
									and light.
								</p>
								<p>
									Oceans and waves are His joy. His joy the Sarasvati, the Jumna, and the Ganges.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Guru is One; and life and death, union and separation, are all His plays of
									joy! His play the land and water, the whole universe! His play the earth and the
									sky! In play is the Creation spread out, in play it is established.
								</p>
								<p>
									The whole world, says Kabîr, rests in His play, yet still the Player remains unknown.</p>

								<p class="poem-start">
									III. 84. <i>jhî jhî jantar bâjai</i></p>
								<p>
									The harp gives forth murmurous music; and the dance goes on without hands and feet.
									It is played without fingers, it is heard without ears; for He is the ear, and He
									is the listener.
								</p>
								<p>
									The gate is locked, but within there is fragrance; and there the meeting is seen
									of none.
								</p>
								<p>
									The wise shall understand it.</p>

									The Beggar goes a-begging, but I could not even catch sight of Him.
								</p>
								<p>
									And what shall I beg of the Beggar? He gives without my asking.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "I am His own; now let that befall which may befall!"</p>

									III. 90. <i>naihar se jiyarâ phât re</i></p>
								<p>
									My heart cries aloud for the house of my lover.
								</p>
								<p>
									The open road and the shelter of a roof are all one to her who has lost the city
									of her husband.
								</p>
								<p>
									My heart finds no joy in anything; my mind and my body are distraught.
								</p>
								<p>
									His palace has a million gates, but there is a vast ocean between it and me; How
									shall I cross it, O friend? For endless is the outstretching of the path.
								</p>
								<p>
									How wondrously this lyre is wrought! When its strings are rightly strung, it maddens
									the heart; but when the keys are broken and the strings are loosened, none regard
									it more.
								</p>
								<p>
									I tell my parents with laughter that I must go to my Lord in the morning; They are
									angry, for they do not want me to go, and they say: "She thinks she has gained such
									dominion over her husband that she can have whatsoever she wishes; and therefore
									she is impatient to go to him."
								</p>
								<p>
									Dear friend, lift my veil lightly now; for this is the night of love.
								</p>

									Kabîr says: "Listen to me! My heart is eager to meet my lover; I lie sleepless upon
									my bed. Remember me early in the morning!"</p>

									Serve your God, who has come into this temple of life! Do not act the part of a
									madman, for the night is thickening fast.
								</p>
								<p>
									He has awaited me for countless ages, for love of me He has lost His heart. Yet
									I did not know the bliss that was so near to me, for my love was not yet awake.
								</p>
								<p>
									But now, my Lover has made known to me the meaning of the note that struck my ear;
									Now, my good fortune is come.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Behold! how great is my good fortune! I have received the unending

									I. 71. <i>gagan ghatâ ghaharânî, sâdho</i></p>

									Clouds thicken in the sky! O, listen to the deep voice of their roaring; The rain
									comes from the east with its monotonous murmur.
								</p>
								<p>
									Take care of the fences and boundaries of your fields, lest the rains overflow them;
									Prepare the soil of deliverance, and let the creepers of love and renunciation be
									soaked in this shower.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is the prudent farmer who will bring his harvest home; he shall fill both his

								<p>
									This day is dear to me above all other days, for today the Beloved Lord is a guest
									in my house; My chamber and my courtyard are beautiful with His presence.
								</p>
								<p>
									My longings sing His Name, and they are become lost in His great beauty. I wash
									His feet, and I look upon His Face; and I lay before Him as an offering my body,
									my mind, and all that I have.
								</p>
								<p>
									What a day of gladness is that day in which my Beloved, who is my treasure, comes
									to my house!
								</p>
								<p>
									All evils fly from my heart when I see my Lord. "My love has touched Him; my heart

									Is there any wise man who will listen to that solemn music which arises in the sky?

								<p>
									For He, the Source of all music, makes all vessels full fraught, and rests in fullness
									Himself.
								</p>
								<p>
									He who is in the body is ever athirst, for he pursues that which is in part; But
									ever there wells forth deeper and deeper the sound "He is this&mdash;this is He";

								<p>
									To no purpose do you bear on your head this load of pride and vanity.
