									Poem I</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 13. <i>mo ko kahân dhûnro bande</i></p>
								<p>
									O servant, where dost thou seek Me? Lo! I am beside thee.</p>
								<p>
									I am neither in temple nor in mosque; I am neither in Kaaba nor in Kailash; Neither
									am I in rites and ceremonies, nor in Yoga and renunciation.
								</p>
								<p>
									If thou art a true seeker, thou shalt at once see Me; thou shalt meet Me in a moment
									of time.</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "O Sadhu! God is the breath of all breath."
								</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									II</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 16. <i>Santan jât na pûcho nirguniyân</i></p>
								<p>
									It is needless to ask of a saint the caste to which he belongs; For the priest,
									the warrior. the tradesman, and all the thirty-six castes, alike are seeking for
									God.</p>
								<p>
									It is but folly to ask what the caste of a saint may be; The barber has sought God,
									the washerwoman, and the carpenter&mdash;Even Raidas was a seeker after God. The
									Rishi Swapacha was a tanner by caste.</p>
								<p>
									Hindus and Moslems alike have achieved that End, where remains no mark of distinction.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									III</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 57. <i>sâdho bhâî, jîval hî karo âs'â</i></p>
								<p>
									O friend! hope for Him whilst you live, know whilst you live, understand whilst
									you live; for in life deliverance abides.</p>
								<p>
									If your bonds be not broken whilst living, what hope of deliverance in death? It
									is but an empty dream, that the soul shall have union with Him because it has passed
									from the body; If He is found now, He is found then; If not, we do but go to dwell
									in the City of Death. If you have union now, you shall have it hereafter.</p>
								<p>
									Bathe in the truth, know the true Guru, have faith in the true Name!</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "It is the Spirit of the quest which helps; I am the slave of this Spirit
									of the quest."</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									IV</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 58. <i>bâgo nâ jâ re nâ jâ</i></p>
								<p>
									Do not go to the garden of flowers! O Friend! go not there; In your body is the
									garden of flowers.</p>
								<p>
									Take your seat on the thousand petals of the lotus, and there gaze on the Infinite
									Beauty.
								</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									V</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 63. <i>avadhû, mâyâ tajî na jây</i></p>
								<p>
									Tell me, Brother, how can I renounce Maya?</p>
								<p>
									When I gave up the tying of ribbons, still I tied my garment about me; When I gave
									up tying my garment, still I covered my body in its folds.
								</p>
								<p>
									So, when I give up passion, I see that anger remains; And when I renounce anger,
									greed is with me still; And when greed is vanquished, pride and vainglory remain;
									When the mind is detached and casts Maya away, still it clings to the letter.</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Listen to me, dear Sadhu! the true path is rarely found."</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									VI</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 83. <i>candâ jhalkai yahi ghat mâhîn</i></p>
								<p>
									The moon shines in my body, but my blind eyes cannot see it; The moon is within
									me, and so is the sun. The unstruck drum of Eternity is sounded within me; but my
									deaf ears cannot hear it.
								</p>
								<p>
									So long as man clamours for the <em>I</em> and the <em>Mine</em>, his works are
									as naught; When all love of the <em>I</em> and the <em>Mine</em> is dead, then the
									work of the Lord is done.</p>
								<p>
									For work has no other aim than the getting of knowledge; When that comes, then work
									is put away.</p>
								<p>
									The flower blooms for the fruit; when the fruit comes, the flower withers.</p>
								<p>
									The musk is in the deer, but it seeks it not within itself; it wanders in quest
									of grass.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									VII</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 85. <i>Sâdho, Brahm alakh lakhâyâ</i></p>
								<p>
									When He Himself reveals Himself, Brahma brings into manifestation That which can
									never be seen.</p>
								<p>
									As the seed is in the plant, as the shade is in the tree, as the void is in the
									sky, as infinite forms are in the void&mdash;So from beyond the Infinite, the Infinite
									comes; and from the Infinite the finite extends.
								</p>
								<p>
									The creature is in Brahma, and Brahma is in the creature; they are ever distinct,
									yet ever united. He Himself is the tree, the seed, and the germ. He Himself is the
									flower, the fruit, and the shade. He Himself is the sun, the light, and the lighted.
									He Himself is Brahma, creature, and Maya.</p>
								<p>
									He Himself is the manifold form, the infinite space; He is the breath, the word,
									and the meaning. He Himself is the limit and the limitless; and beyond both the
									limited and the limitless is He, the Pure Being.</p>
								<p>
									He is the Immanent Mind in Brahma and in the creature.</p>
								<p>
									The Supreme Soul is seen within the soul, The Point is seen within the Supreme Soul,
									And within the Point, the reflection is seen again.</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr is blest because he has this supreme vision!</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									VIII</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 101. <i>is ghat antar bâg bagîce</i></p>
								<p>
									Within this earthen vessel are bowers and groves, and within it is the Creator;
									Within this vessel are the seven oceans and the unnumbered stars. The touchstone
									and the jewel-appraiser are within; And within this vessel the Eternal soundeth,
									and the spring wells up.</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Listen to me, my Friend! My beloved Lord is within."</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									IX</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 104. <i>aisâ lo nahîn taisâ lo</i></p>
								<p>
									O How may I ever express that secret word? O how can I say He is not like this,
									and He is like that? If I say that He is within me, the universe is ashamed; If
									I say that He is without me, it is falsehood.</p>
								<p>
									He makes the inner and the outer worlds to be indivisibly one; The conscious and
									the unconscious, both are His footstools.
								</p>
								<p>
									He is neither manifest nor hidden, He is neither revealed nor unrevealed; There
									are no words to tell that which He is.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									X</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 121. <i>tohi mori lagan lagâye re phakîr wâ</i></p>
								<p>
									To Thee Thou hast drawn my love, O Fakir! I was sleeping in my own chamber, and
									Thou didst awaken me; striking me with Thy voice, O Fakir! I was drowning in the
									deeps of the ocean of this world, and Thou didst save me; upholding me with Thine
									arm, O Fakir! Only one word and no second&mdash;and Thou hast made me tear off all
									my bonds, O Fakir!
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Thou hast united Thy heart to my heart, O Fakir!"</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									XI</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									I. 131. <i>nis' din khelat rahî sakhiyân sang</i></p>
								<p>
									I played day and night with my comrades, and now I am greatly afraid. So high is
									my Lord's palace, my heart trembles to mount its stairs; yet I must not be shy,
									if I would enjoy His love.
								</p>
								<p>
									My heart must cleave to my Lover; I must withdraw my veil, and meet Him with all
									my body; Mine eyes must perform the ceremony of the lamps of love.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Listen to me, friend: he understands who loves. If you feel not love's
									longing for your Beloved One, it is vain to adorn your body, vain to put unguent
									on your eyelids."</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									XII</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									II. 24. <i>hamsâ, kaho purâtan vât</i></p>
								<p>
									Tell me, O Swan, your ancient tale. From what land do you come, O Swan? to what
									shore will you fly? Where would you take your rest, O Swan, and what do you seek?
								</p>
								<p>
									Even this morning, O Swan, awake, arise, follow me!
								</p>
								<p>
									There is a land where no doubt nor sorrow have rule; where the terror of Death is
									no more.
								</p>
								<p>
									There the woods of spring are a-bloom, and the fragrant scent "He is I" is borne
									on the wind: There the bee of the heart is deeply immersed, and desires no other
									joy.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									XIII</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									II. 37. <i>angadhiyâ devâ</i></p>
								<p>
									O Lord Increate, who will serve Thee? Every votary offers his worship to the God
									of his own creation; each day he receives service. None seek Him, the Perfect: Brahma,
									the Indivisible Lord.
								</p>
								<p>
									They believe in ten Avatars; but no Avatar can be the Infinite Spirit, for he suffers
									the results of his deeds; The Supreme One must be other than this. The Yogi, the
									Sanyasi, the Ascetics, are disputing one with another.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "O brother! he who has seen that radiance of love, he is saved."</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									XIV</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									II. 56. <i>dariyâ kî lahar dariyâo hai jî</i></p>
								<p>
									The river and its waves are one surf; where is the difference between the river
									and its waves? When the wave rises, it is the water; and when it falls, it is the
									same water again.
								</p>
								<p>
									Tell me, Sir, where is the distinction? Because it has been named as wave, shall
									it no longer be considered as water?</p>
								<p>
									Within the Supreme Brahma, the worlds are being told like beads; Look upon that
									rosary with the eyes of wisdom.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									XV</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									II. 57. <i>jânh khelat vasant riturâj</i></p>
								<p>
									Where Spring, the lord of the seasons, reigneth, there the Unstruck Music sounds
									of itself, There the streams of light flow in all directions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Few are the men who can cross to that shore!
								</p>
								<p>
									There, where millions of Krishnas stand with hands folded, Where millions of Vishnus
									bow their heads, Where millions of Brahmâs are reading the Vedas. Where millions
									of Shivas are lost in contemplation, Where millions of Indras dwell in the sky,
									Where the demi-gods and the munis are unnumbered, Where millions of Saraswatis,
									Goddess of Music, play on the vina&mdash;
								</p>
								<p>
									There is my Lord self-revealed; and the scent of sandal and flowers dwells in those
									deeps.
								</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									XVI</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									II. 59. <i>jânh, cet acet khambh dôû</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									Between the poles of the conscious and the unconscious, there has the mind made
									a swing:
								</p>
								<p>
									Thereon hang all beings and all worlds, and that swing never ceases its sway. Millions
									of beings are there; the sun and the moon in their courses are there; Millions of
									ages pass, and the swing goes on. All swing! the sky and the earth and the air and
									the water; and the Lord Himself taking form.
								</p>
								<p>
									And the sight of this has made Kabîr a servant.</p>
								<h5 class="poem">
									XVII</h5>
								<p class="poem-start">
									II. 61. <i>grah candra tapan jot varat hai</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									The light of the sun, the moon, and the stars shines bright; The melody of love
									swells forth, and the rhythm of love's detachment beats the time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Day and night, the chorus of music fills the heavens; and Kabîr says "My Beloved
									One gleams like the lightning flash in the sky."</p>
								<p>
									Do you know how the moments perform their adoration?
								</p>
								<p>
									Waving its row of lamps, the universe sings in worship day and night; there are
									the hidden banner and the secret canopy; there the sound of the unseen bells is
									heard.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "There adoration never ceases; there the Lord of the Universe sitteth
									on His throne."
								</p>
								<p>
									The whole world does its works and commits its errors; but few are the lovers who
									know the Beloved.
								</p>
								<p>
									The devout seeker is he who mingles in his heart the double currents of love and
									detachment, like the mingling of the streams of Ganges and Jumna; In his heart the
									sacred water flows day and night; and thus the round of births and deaths is brought
									to an end.</p>
								<p>
									Behold what wonderful rest is in the Supreme Spirit! and he enjoys it, who makes
									himself meet for it.
								</p>
								<p>
									Held by the cords of love, the swing of the Ocean of Joy sways to and fro; and a
									mighty sound breaks forth in song.
								</p>
								<p>
									See what a lotus blooms there without water! and Kabîr says "My heart's bee drinks
									its nectar."
								</p>
								<p>
									What a wonderful lotus it is, that blooms at the heart of the spinning wheel of
									the universe! Only a few pure souls know of its true delight. Music is all around
									it, and there the heart partakes of the joy of the Infinite Sea.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Dive thou into that Ocean of sweetness; thus let all errors of life
									and of death flee away."</p>
								<p>
									Behold how the thirst of the five senses is quenched there! and the three forms
									of misery are no more!
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "It is the sport of the Unattainable One; look within, and behold how
									the moon-beams of that Hidden One shine in you."
								</p>
								<p>
									There falls the rhythmic beat of life and death; Rapture wells forth, and all space
									is radiant with light.
								</p>
								<p>
									There the Unstruck Music is sounded; it is the music of the love of the three worlds.
									There millions of lamps of sun and of moon are burning; There the drum beats, and
									the lover swings in play. There love-songs resound, and light rains in showers;
									and the worshipper is entranced in the taste of the heavenly nectar.
								</p>
								<p>
									Look upon life and death; there is no separation between them, The right hand and
									the left hand are one and the same.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "There the wise man is speechless; for this truth may never be found
									in Vadas or in books."</p>
								<p>
									I have had my Seat on the Self-poised One, I have drunk of the Cup of the Ineffable,
									I have found the Key of the Mystery, I have reached the Root of Union.
								</p>
								<p>
									Travelling by no track, I have come to the Sorrowless Land; very easily has the
									mercy of the great Lord come upon me.
								</p>
								<p>
									They have sung of Him as infinite and unattainable; but I in my meditations have
									seen Him without sight.
								</p>
								<p>
									That is indeed the sorrowless land, and none know the path that leads there; Only
									he who is on that path has surely transcended all sorrow.
								</p>
								<p>
									Wonderful is that land of rest, to which no merit can win; It is the wise who has
									seen it, it is the wise who has sung of it.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is the Ultimate Word; but can any express its marvellous savour? He who has
									savoured it once, he knows what joy it can give.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Knowing it, the ignorant man becomes wise, and the wise man becomes
									speechless and silent, The worshipper is utterly inebriated, His wisdom and his
									detachment are made perfect; He drinks from the cup of the inbreathings and the
									outbreathings of love."</p>
								<p>
									There the whole sky is filled with sound, and there that music is made without fingers
									and without strings; There the game of pleasure and pain does not cease.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "If you merge your life in the Ocean of Life, you will find your life
									in the Supreme Land of Bliss."</p>
								<p>
									What a frenzy of ecstasy there is in every hour! and the worshipper is pressing
									out and drinking the essence of the hours; he lives in the life of Brahma.
								</p>
								<p>
									I speak truth, for I have accepted truth in life; I am now attached to truth, I
									have swept all tinsel away.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Thus is the worshipper set free from fear; thus have all errors of
									life and of death left him."</p>
								<p>
									There the sky is filled with music; There it rains nectar; There the harp-strings
									jingle, and there the drums beat.
								</p>
								<p>
									What a secret splendour is there, in the mansion of the sky! There no mention is
									made of the rising and the setting of the sun; In the ocean of manifestation, which
									is the light of love, day and night are felt to be one. Joy for ever, no sorrow,&mdash;no
									struggle!
								</p>
								<p>
									There have I seen joy filled to the brim, perfection of joy; No place for error
									is there.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "There have I witnessed the sport of One Bliss!"</p>
								<p>
									I have known in my body the sport of the universe; I have escaped from the error
									of this world. The inward and the outward are become as one sky, the Infinite and
									the finite are united; I am drunken with the sight of this All!
								</p>
								<p>
									This Light of Thine fulfils the universe; the lamp of love that burns on the salver
									of knowledge.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "There error cannot enter, and the conflict of life and death is felt
									no more."</p>

									II. 77. <i>maddh âkas' âp jahân baithe</i></p>
								<p>
									The middle region of the sky, wherein the spirit dwelleth, is radiant with the music
									of light; There, where the pure and white music blossoms, my Lord takes His delight.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the wondrous effulgence of each hair of His body, the brightness of millions
									of suns and of moons is lost. On that shore there is a city, where the rain of nectar
									pours and pours, and never ceases.

									Run to the feet of your Beloved; for your Lord stands near to your head.

								<p>
									To what shore would you cross, O my heart? there is no traveller before you, there
									is no road.
								</p>
								<p>
									Where is the movement, where is the rest, on that shore? There is no water; no boat,
									no boatman, is there; There is not so much as a rope to tow the boat, nor a man
									to draw it. No earth, no sky, no time, no thing, is there; no shore, no ford!
								</p>
								<p>
									There, there is neither body nor mind; and where is the place that shall still the
									thirst of the soul? You shall find naught in that emptiness. Be strong, and enter
									into your own body; for there your foothold is firm. Consider it well, O my heart!
									go not elsewhere,
								</p>

									Lamps burn in every house, O blind one! and you cannot see them.
								</p>
								<p>
									One day your eyes shall suddenly be opened, and you shall see; and the fetters of
									death will fall from you.
								</p>
								<p>
									There is nothing to say or to hear, there is nothing to do; it is he who is living,
									yet dead, who shall never die again.</p>
								<p>
									Because he lives in solitude, therefore the Yogi says that his home is far away.
									Your Lord is near; yet you are climbing the palm-tree to seek Him.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Brâhman priest goes from house to house and initiates people into faith; Alas!
									the true fountain of life is beside you, and you have set up a stone to worship.

									O brother, my heart yearns for that true Guru, who fills the cup of true love, and
									drinks of it himself, and offers it then to me.
								</p>
								<p>
									He removes the veil from the eyes, and gives the true Vision of Brahma; He reveals
									the worlds in Him, and makes me to hear the Unstruck Music; He shows joy and sorrow

									that steeps the petals of the lotus of the heart. Receive the waves in your body;
									what splendour is in the region of the sea!
								</p>
								<p>
									Hark! the sounds of conches and bells are rising.

									More than all else do I cherish at heart that love which makes me to live a limitless
									life in this world.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is like the lotus, which lives in the water and blooms in the water; yet the
									water cannot touch its petals, they open beyond its reach. It is like a wife, who
									enters the fire at the bidding of love. She burns and lets others grieve, yet never
									dishonours love.
								</p>
								<p>
									This ocean of the world is hard to cross; its waters are very deep.
								</p>

									Kabîr says: "Listen to me, O Sadhu! few there are who have reached its end."</p>

								<p>
									My Lord hides Himself, and my Lord wonderfully reveals Himself; My Lord has encompassed
									me with hardness, and my Lord has cast down my limitations. My Lord brings to me
									words of sorrow and words of joy, and He Himself heals their strife.
								</p>
								<p>
									I will offer my body and mind to my Lord; I will give up my life, but never can
									I forget my Lord!
