									II. 75. <i>ônkâr siwae kôî sirjai</i></p>
								<p>
									All things are created by the Om; The love-form is His body. He is without form,
									without quality, without decay; Seek thou union with Him!
								</p>
								<p>
									But that formless God takes a thousand forms in the eyes of His creatures; He is
									pure and indestructible, His form is infinite and fathomless, He dances in rapture,
									and waves of form arise from His dance. The body and the mind cannot contain themselves,
									when they are touched by His great joy.
								</p>
								<p>
									He is immersed in all consciousness, all joys, and all sorrows; He has no beginning
									and no end; He holds all within His bliss.</p>

									II. 81. <i>satgur sôî dayâ kar dînhâ</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									It is the mercy of my true Guru that has made me to know the unknown; I have learned
									from Him how to walk without feet, to see without eyes, to hear without ears, to
									drink without mouth, to fly without wings; I have brought my love and my meditation
									into the land where there is no sun and moon, nor day and night.
								</p>
								<p>
									Without eating, I have tasted of the sweetness of nectar; and without water, I have
									quenched my thirst. Where there is the response of delight, there is the fullness
									of joy. Before whom can that joy be uttered?
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "The Guru is great beyond words, and great is the good fortune of the
									disciple."

									II. 87. <i>Kabîr kab se bhaye vairâgî</i>
								</p>
								<p>
									Gorakhnath asks Kabîr: "Tell me, O Kabîr, when did your vocation begin? Where did
									your love have its rise?"
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr answers: "When He whose forms are manifold had not begun His play; when there
									was no Guru, and no disciple; when the world was not spread out; when the Supreme
									One was alone&mdash;Then I became an ascetic; then, O Gorakh, my love was drawn
									to Brahma.
								</p>
								<p>
									Brahma did not hold the crown on his head; the god Vishnu was not anointed as king;
									the power of Shiva was still unborn; when I was instructed in Yoga.</p>
								<p>
									I became suddenly revealed in Benares, and Râmânanda illumined me; I brought with
									me the thirst for the Infinite, and I have come for the meeting with Him. In simplicity
									will I unite with the Simple One; my love will surge up.
								</p>
								<p>
									O Gorakh, march thou with His music!"</p>

									II. 95. <i>yâ tarvar men ek pakherû</i></p>
								<p>
									On this tree is a bird; it dances in the joy of life. None knows where it is; and
									who knows what the burden of its music may be?
								</p>
								<p>
									Where the branches throw a deep shade, there does it have its nest; it comes in
									the evening and flies away in the morning, and says not a word of that which it
									means.
								</p>
								<p>
									None tell me of this bird that sings within me. It is neither coloured nor colourless;
									it has neither form nor outline; It sits in the shadow of love. It dwells within
									the Unattainable, the Infinite, and the Eternal; and no one marks when it comes
									and goes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "O brother Sadhu! deep is the mystery. Let wise men seek to know where
									rests that bird."</p>

									II. 100. <i>nis` din sâlai ghâw</i></p>
								<p>
									A sore pain troubles me day and night, and I cannot sleep; I long for the meeting
									with my Beloved, and my father's house gives me pleasure no more.
								</p>
								<p>
									The gates of the sky are opened, the temple is revealed; I meet my husband, and
									leave at His feet the offering of my body and my mind.</p>

									Dance, my heart! dance today with joy. The strains of love fill the days and the
									nights with music, and the world is listening to its melodies.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mad with joy, life and death dance to the rhythm of this music. The hills and the
									sea and the earth dance. The world of man dances in laughter and tears.

									Why put on the robe of the monk, and live aloof from the world in lonely pride?
									Behold! my heart dances in the delight of a hundred arts; and the Creator is well

									Where is the need of words, when love has made drunken the heart?
								</p>
								<p>
									I have wrapped the diamond in my cloak; why open it again and again? When its load
									was light, the pan of the balance went up; now it is full, where is the need for
									weighing?
								</p>
								<p>
									The swan has taken its flight to the lake beyond the mountains; why should it search

									Your Lord dwells within you; why need your outward eyes be opened?

									II. 110. <i>mohi tohi lâgî kaise chute</i></p>
								<p>
									How could the love between Thee and me sever? As the leaf of the lotus abides on
									the water, so thou art my Lord, and I am Thy servant. As the night-bird Chakor gazes
									all night at the moon; so Thou art my Lord and I am Thy servant.
								</p>
								<p>
									From the beginning until the ending of time, there is love between Thee and me;
									and how shall such love be extinguished?
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "As the river enters into the ocean, so my heart touches Thee."</p>

									My body and my mind are grieved for the want of Thee; O my Beloved! come to my house.
								</p>
								<p>
									When people say I am Thy bride, I am ashamed; for I have not touched Thy heart with
									my heart.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then what is this love of mine? I have no taste for food, I have no sleep; my heart
									is ever restless within doors and without. As water is to the thirsty, so is the
									lover to the bride. Who is there that will carry my news to my Beloved?
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr is restless; he is dying for sight of Him.</p>

								<p>
									O friend, awake, and sleep no more! The night is over and gone, would you lose your
									day also?
								</p>
								<p>
									Others, who have wakened, have received jewels; O foolish woman! you have lost all
									whilst you slept.
								</p>
								<p>
									Your lover is wise, and you are foolish, O woman! You never prepared the bed of
									your husband; O mad one! you passed your time in silly play. Your youth was passed
									in vain, for you did not know your Lord;
								</p>
								<p>
									Wake, wake! See! your bed is empty; He left you in the night.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "Only she wakes, whose heart is pierced with the arrow of His music."</p>

								<p>
									Where is the night, when the sun is shining? If it is night, then the sun withdraws
									its light.
								</p>
								<p>
									Where knowledge is, can ignorance endure? If there be ignorance, then knowledge
									must die.
								</p>
								<p>
									If there be lust, how can love be there? Where there is love, there is no lust.</p>
								<p>
									Lay hold on your sword, and join in the fight. Fight, O my brother, as long as life

									come, and bow your head at your King's Durbar.
								</p>
								<p>
									He who is brave, never forsakes the battle; he who flies from it is no true fighter.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the field of this body a great war goes forward, against passion, anger, pride,
									and greed; It is in the kingdom of truth, contentment and purity, that this battle
									is raging; and the sword that rings forth most loudly is the sword of His Name.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr says: "When a brave knight takes the field, a host of cowards is put to flight.
									It is a hard fight and a weary one, this fight of the truth-seeker; for the vow
									of the truth-seeker is more hard than that of the warrior, or of the widowed wife
									who would follow her husband. For the warrior fights for a few hours, and the widow's
									struggle with death is soon ended; But the truth-seeker's battle goes on day and
									night, as long as life lasts it never ceases."

									He is dear to me indeed who can call back the wanderer to his home.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the home is the true union, in the home is enjoyment of life; why should I forsake
									my home and wander in the forest?
								</p>
								<p>
									If Brahma helps me to realize truth, verily I will find both bondage and deliverance
									in home.
								</p>
								<p>
									He is dear to me indeed who has power to dive deep into Brahma; whose mind loses

								</p>
								<p>
									He is dear to me who knows Brahma, and can dwell on His supreme truth in meditation;

									Since the day when I met with my Lord, there has been no end to the sport of our
									love.
								</p>
								<p>
									I shut not my eyes, I close not my ears, I do not mortify my body; I see with eyes

									The rising and the setting are one to me; all contradictions are solved. Wherever
