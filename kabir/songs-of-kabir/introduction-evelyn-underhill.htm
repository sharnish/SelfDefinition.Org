								<h4>
									Life of Kabir
								</h4>
								<p>
									The poet Kabîr, a selection from whose songs is here for the first time offered
									to English readers, is one of the most interesting personalities in the history
									of Indian mysticism. Born in or near Benares, of Mohammedan parents, and probably
									about the year 1440, he became in early life a disciple of the celebrated Hindu
									ascetic Râmânanda. Râmânanda had brought to Northern India the religious revival
									which Râmânuja, the great twelfth-century reformer of Brâhmanism, had initiated
									in the South. This revival was in part a reaction against the increasing formalism
									of the orthodox cult, in part an assertion of the demands of the heart as against
									the intense intellectualism of the Vedânta philosophy, the exaggerated monism which
									that philosophy proclaimed. It took in Râmânuja's preaching the form of an ardent
									personal devotion to the God Vishnu, as representing the personal aspect of the
									Divine Nature: that mystical "religion of love" which everywhere makes its appearance
									at a certain level of spiritual culture, and which creeds and philosophies are powerless
									to kill.</p>
								<p>
									Though such a devotion is indigenous in Hinduism, and finds expression in many passages
									of the Bhagavad Gîtâ, there was in its mediæval revival a large element of syncretism.
									Râmânanda, through whom its spirit is said to have reached Kabîr, appears to have
									been a man of wide religious culture, and full of missionary enthusiasm. Living
									at the moment in which the impassioned poetry and deep philosophy of the great Persian
									mystics, Attâr, Sâdî, Jalâlu'ddîn Rûmî, and Hâfiz, were exercising a powerful influence
									on the religious thought of India, he dreamed of reconciling this intense and personal
									Mohammedan mysticism with the traditional theology of Brâhmanism. Some have regarded
									both these great religious leaders as influenced also by Christian thought and life:
									but as this is a point upon which competent authorities hold widely divergent views,
									its discussion is not attempted here. We may safely assert, however, that in their
									teachings, two&mdash;perhaps three&mdash;apparently antagonistic streams of intense
									spiritual culture met, as Jewish and Hellenistic thought met in the early Christian
									Church: and it is one of the outstanding characteristics of Kabîr's genius that
									he was able in his poems to fuse them into one.
								</p>
								<p>
									A great religious reformer, the founder of a sect to which nearly a million northern
									Hindus still belong, it is yet supremely as a mystical poet that Kabîr lives for
									us. His fate has been that of many revealers of Reality. A hater of religious exclusivism,
									and seeking above all things to initiate men into the liberty of the children of
									God, his followers have honoured his memory by re-erecting in a new place the barriers
									which he laboured to cast down. But his wonderful songs survive, the spontaneous
									expressions of his vision and his love; and it is by these, not by the didactic
									teachings associated with his name, that he makes his immortal appeal to the heart.
									In these poems a wide range of mystical emotion is brought into play: from the loftiest
									abstractions, the most otherworldly passion for the Infinite, to the most intimate
									and personal realization of God, expressed in homely metaphors and religious symbols
									drawn indifferently from Hindu and Mohammedan belief.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is impossible to say of their author that he was Brâhman or Sûfî, Vedântist or
									Vaishnavite. He is, as he says himself, "at once the child of Allah and of Râm."
									That Supreme Spirit Whom he knew and adored, and to Whose joyous friendship he sought
									to induct the souls of other men, transcended whilst He included all metaphysical
									categories, all credal definitions; yet each contributed something to the description
									of that Infinite and Simple Totality Who revealed Himself, according to their measure,
									to the faithful lovers of all creeds.</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr's story is surrounded by contradictory legends, on none of which reliance
									can be placed. Some of these emanate from a Hindu, some from a Mohammedan source,
									and claim him by turns as a Sûfî and a Brâhman saint. His name, however, is practically
									a conclusive proof of Moslem ancestry: and the most probable tale is that which
									represents him as the actual or adopted child of a Mohammedan weaver of Benares,
									the city in which the chief events of his life took place.</p>
								<p>
									In fifteenth-century Benares the syncretistic tendencies of Bhakti religion had
									reached full development. Sûfîs and Brâhmans appear to have met in disputation:
									the most spiritual members of both creeds frequenting the teachings of Râmânanda,
									whose reputation was then at its height. The boy Kabîr, in whom the religious passion
									was innate, saw in Râmânanda his destined teacher; but knew how slight were the
									chances that a Hindu guru would accept a Mohammedan as disciple. He therefore hid
									upon the steps of the river Ganges, where Râmânanda was accustomed to bathe; with
									the result that the master, coming down to the water, trod upon his body unexpectedly,
									and exclaimed in his astonishment, "Ram! Ram!"&mdash;the name of the incarnation
									under which he worshipped God. Kabîr then declared that he had received the mantra
									of initiation from Râmânanda's lips, and was by it admitted to discipleship. In
									spite of the protests of orthodox Brâhmans and Mohammedans, both equally annoyed
									by this contempt of theological landmarks, he persisted in his claim; thus exhibiting
									in action that very principle of religious synthesis which Râmânanda had sought
									to establish in thought. Râmânanda appears to have accepted him, and though Mohammedan
									legends speak of the famous Sûfî Pîr, Takkî of Jhansî, as Kabîr's master in later
									life, the Hindu saint is the only human teacher to whom in his songs he acknowledges
									indebtedness.
								</p>
								<p>
									The little that we know of Kabîr's life contradicts many current ideas concerning
									the Oriental mystic. Of the stages of discipline through which he passed, the manner
									in which his spiritual genius developed, we are completely ignorant. He seems to
									have remained for years the disciple of Râmânanda, joining in the theological and
									philosophical arguments which his master held with all the great Mullahs and Brâhmans
									of his day; and to this source we may perhaps trace his acquaintance with the terms
									of Hindu and Sûfî philosophy. He may or may not have submitted to the traditional
									education of the Hindu or the Sûfî contemplative: it is clear, at any rate, that
									he never adopted the life of the professional ascetic, or retired from the world
									in order to devote himself to bodily mortifications and the exclusive pursuit of
									the contemplative life. Side by side with his interior life of adoration, its artistic
									expression in music and words&mdash;for he was a skilled musician as well as a poet&mdash;he
									lived the sane and diligent life of the Oriental craftsman.
								</p>
								<p>
									All the legends agree on this point: that Kabîr was a weaver, a simple and unlettered
									man, who earned his living at the loom. Like Paul the tentmaker, Boehme the cobbler,
									Bunyan the tinker, Tersteegen the ribbon-maker, he knew how to combine vision and
									industry; the work of his hands helped rather than hindered the impassioned meditation
									of his heart. Hating mere bodily austerities, he was no ascetic, but a married man,
									the father of a family&mdash;a circumstance which Hindu legends of the monastic
									type vainly attempt to conceal or explain&mdash;and it was from out of the heart
									of the common life that he sang his rapturous lyrics of divine love. Here his works
									corroborate the traditional story of his life. Again and again he extols the life
									of home, the value and reality of diurnal existence, with its opportunities for
									love and renunciation; pouring contempt&mdash;upon the professional sanctity of
									the Yogi, who "has a great beard and matted locks, and looks like a goat," and on
									all who think it necessary to flee a world pervaded by love, joy, and beauty&mdash;the
									proper theatre of man's quest&mdash;in order to find that One Reality Who has "spread
									His form of love throughout all the world." [Footnote: Cf. Poems Nos. XXI, XL, XLIII,
									LXVI, LXXVI.]</p>
								<p>
									It does not need much experience of ascetic literature to recognize the boldness
									and originality of this attitude in such a time and place. From the point of view
									of orthodox sanctity, whether Hindu or Mohammedan, Kabîr was plainly a heretic;
									and his frank dislike of all institutional religion, all external observance&mdash;which
									was as thorough and as intense as that of the Quakers themselves&mdash;completed,
									so far as ecclesiastical opinion was concerned, his reputation as a dangerous man.
									The "simple union" with Divine Reality which he perpetually extolled, as alike the
									duty and the joy of every soul, was independent both of ritual and of bodily austerities;
									the God whom he proclaimed was "neither in Kaaba nor in Kailâsh." Those who sought
									Him needed not to go far; for He awaited discovery everywhere, more accessible to
									"the washerwoman and the carpenter" than to the self&mdash;righteous holy man. [Footnote:
									Poems I, II, XLI.]
								</p>
								<p>
									Therefore the whole apparatus of piety, Hindu and Moslem alike&mdash;the temple
									and mosque, idol and holy water, scriptures and priests&mdash;were denounced by
									this inconveniently clear-sighted poet as mere substitutes for reality; dead things
									intervening between the soul and its love&mdash;</p>
								<blockquote>
									The images are all lifeless, they cannot speak:<br />
									I know, for I have cried aloud to them.<br />
									The Purâna and the Koran are mere words:<br />
									lifting up the curtain, I have seen.<br />
									<br />
									[Footnote: Poems XLII, LXV, LXVII.]<br />
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									This sort of thing cannot be tolerated by any organized church; and it is not surprising
									that Kabîr, having his head-quarters in Benares, the very centre of priestly influence,
									was subjected to considerable persecution. The well-known legend of the beautiful
									courtesan sent by Brâhmans to tempt his virtue, and converted, like the Magdalen,
									by her sudden encounter with the initiate of a higher love, pre serves the memory
									of the fear and dislike with which he was regarded by the ecclesiastical powers.
									Once at least, after the performance of a supposed miracle of healing, he was brought
									before the Emperor Sikandar Lodi, and charged with claiming the possession of divine
									powers.
								</p>
								<p>
									But Sikandar Lodi, a ruler of considerable culture, was tolerant of the eccentricities
									of saintly persons belonging to his own faith. Kabîr, being of Mohammedan birth,
									was outside the authority of the Brâhmans, and technically classed with the Sûfîs,
									to whom great theological latitude was allowed. Therefore, though he was banished
									in the interests of peace from Benares, his life was spared. This seems to have
									happened in 1495, when he was nearly sixty years of age; it is the last event in
									his career of which we have definite knowledge. Thenceforth he appears to have moved
									about amongst various cities of northern India, the centre of a group of disciples;
									continuing in exile that life of apostle and poet of love to which, as he declares
									in one of his songs, he was destined "from the beginning of time." In 1518, an old
									man, broken in health, and with hands so feeble that he could no longer make the
									music which he loved, he died at Maghar near Gorakhpur.</p>
								<p>
									A beautiful legend tells us that after his death his Mohammedan and Hindu disciples
									disputed the possession of his body; which the Mohammedans wished to bury, the Hindus
									to burn. As they argued together, Kabîr appeared before them, and told them to lift
									the shroud and look at that which lay beneath. They did so, and found in the place
									of the corpse a heap of flowers; half of which were buried by the Mohammedans at
									Maghar, and half carried by the Hindus to the holy city of Benares to be burned&mdash;fitting
									conclusion to a life which had made fragrant the most beautiful doctrines of two
									great creeds.

								<h4>
									II The Poetry of Mysticism</h4>
								<p style="margin-top: 2em">
									The poetry of mysticism might be defined on the one hand as a temperamental reaction
									to the vision of Reality: on the other, as a form of prophecy. As it is the special
									vocation of the mystical consciousness to mediate between two orders, going out
									in loving adoration towards God and coming home to tell the secrets of Eternity
									to other men; so the artistic self-expression of this consciousness has also a double
									character. It is love-poetry, but love-poetry which is often written with a missionary
									intention.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr's songs are of this kind: out-births at once of rapture and of charity. Written
									in the popular Hindi, not in the literary tongue, they were deliberately addressed&mdash;like
									the vernacular poetry of Jacopone da Todì and Richard Rolle&mdash;to the people
									rather than to the professionally religious class; and all must be struck by the
									constant employment in them of imagery drawn from the common life, the universal
									experience. It is by the simplest metaphors, by constant appeals to needs, passions,
									relations which all men understand&mdash;the bridegroom and bride, the guru and
									disciple, the pilgrim, the farmer, the migrant bird&mdash; that he drives home his
									intense conviction of the reality of the soul's intercourse with the Transcendent.
									There are in his universe no fences between the "natural" and "supernatural" worlds;
									everything is a part of the creative Play of God, and therefore&mdash;even in its
									humblest details&mdash;capable of revealing the Player's mind.</p>
								<p>
									This willing acceptance of the here-and-now as a means of representing supernal
									realities is a trait common to the greatest mystics. For them, when they have achieved
									at last the true theopathetic state, all aspects of the universe possess equal authority
									as sacramental declarations of the Presence of God; and their fearless employment
									of homely and physical symbols&mdash;often startling and even revolting to the unaccustomed
									taste&mdash;is in direct proportion to the exaltation of their spiritual life. The
									works of the great Sûfîs, and amongst the Christians of Jacopone da Todì, Ruysbroeck,
									Boehme, abound in illustrations of this law. Therefore we must not be surprised
									to find in Kabîr's songs&mdash;his desperate attempts to communicate his ecstasy
									and persuade other men to share it&mdash;a constant juxtaposition of concrete and
									metaphysical language; swift alternations between the most intensely anthropomorphic,
									the most subtly philosophical, ways of apprehending man's communion with the Divine.
									The need for this alternation, and its entire naturalness for the mind which employs
									it, is rooted in his concept, or vision, of the Nature of God; and unless we make
									some attempt to grasp this, we shall not go far in our understanding of his poems.</p>
								<p>
									Kabîr belongs to that small group of supreme mystics&mdash;amongst whom St. Augustine,
									Ruysbroeck, and the Sûfî poet Jalâlu'ddîn Rûmî are perhaps the chief&mdash;who have
									achieved that which we might call the synthetic vision of God. These have resolved
									the perpetual opposition between the personal and impersonal, the transcendent and
									immanent, static and dynamic aspects of the Divine Nature; between the Absolute
									of philosophy and the "sure true Friend" of devotional religion. They have done
									this, not by taking these apparently incompatible concepts one after the other;
									but by ascending to a height of spiritual intuition at which they are, as Ruysbroeck
									said, "melted and merged in the Unity," and perceived as the completing opposites
									of a perfect Whole. This proceeding entails for them&mdash;and both Kabîr and Ruysbroeck
									expressly acknowledge it&mdash;a universe of three orders: Becoming, Being, and
									that which is "More than Being," i.e., God. [Footnote: Nos. VII and XLIX.]
								</p>
								<p>
									God is here felt to be not the final abstraction, but the one actuality. He inspires,
									supports, indeed inhabits, both the durational, conditioned, finite world of Becoming
									and the unconditioned, non-successional, infinite world of Being; yet utterly transcends
									them both. He is the omnipresent Reality, the "All-pervading" within Whom "the worlds
									are being told like beads." In His personal aspect He is the "beloved Fakir," teaching
									and companioning each soul. Considered as Immanent Spirit, He is "the Mind within
									the mind." But all these are at best partial aspects of His nature, mutually corrective:
									as the Persons in the Christian doctrine of the Trinity&mdash;to which this theological
									diagram bears a striking resemblance&mdash;represent different and compensating
									experiences of the Divine Unity within which they are resumed. As Ruysbroeck discerned
									a plane of reality upon which "we can speak no more of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
									but only of One Being, the very substance of the Divine Persons"; so Kabîr says
									that "beyond both the limited and the limitless is He, the Pure Being." [Footnote:
									No. VII.]</p>
								<p>
									Brahma, then, is the Ineffable Fact compared with which "the distinction of the
									Conditioned from the Unconditioned is but a word": at once the utterly transcendent
									One of Absolutist philosophy, and the personal Lover of the individual soul&mdash;"common
									to all and special to each," as one Christian mystic has it. The need felt by Kabîr
									for both these ways of describing Reality is a proof of the richness and balance
									of his spiritual experience; which neither cosmic nor anthropomorphic symbols, taken
									alone, could express. More absolute than the Absolute, more personal than the human
									mind, Brahma therefore exceeds whilst He includes all the concepts of philosophy,
									all the passionate intuitions of the heart. He is the Great Affirmation, the font
									of energy, the source of life and love, the unique satisfaction of desire. His creative
									word is the <i>Om</i> or "Everlasting Yea." The negative philosophy which strips
									from the Divine Nature all Its attributes and defining Him only by that which He
									is not&mdash;reduces Him to an "Emptiness," is abhorrent to this most vital of poets.&mdash;Brahma,
									he says, "may never be found in abstractions." He is the One Love who Pervades the
									world., discerned in His fullness only by the eyes of love; and those who know Him
									thus share, though they may never tell, the joyous and ineffable secret of the universe.
									[Footnote: Nos. VII, XXVI, LXXVI, XC.]</p>
								<p>
									Now Kabîr, achieving this synthesis between the personal and cosmic aspects of the
									Divine Nature, eludes the three great dangers which threaten mystical religion.</p>
								<p>
									First, he escapes the excessive emotionalism, the tendency to an exclusively anthropomorphic
									devotion, which results from an unrestricted cult of Divine Personality, especially
									under an incarnational form; seen in India in the exaggerations of Krishna worship,
									in Europe in the sentimental extravagances of certain Christian saints.</p>
								<p>
									Next, he is protected from the soul-destroying conclusions of pure monism, inevitable
									if its logical implications are pressed home: that is, the identity of substance
									between God and the soul, with its corollary of the total absorption of that soul
									in the Being of God as the goal of the spiritual life. For the thorough-going monist
									the soul, in so far as it is real, is substantially identical with God; and the
									true object of existence is the making patent of this latent identity, the realization
									which finds expression in the Vedântist formula "That art thou." But Kabîr says
									that Brahma and the creature are "ever distinct, yet ever united"; that the wise
									man knows the spiritual as well as the material world to "be no more than His footstool."
									[Footnote: Nos. VII and IX.]
								</p>
								<p>
									The soul's union with Him is a love union, a mutual inhabitation; that essentially
									dualistic relation which all mystical religion expresses, not a self-mergence which
									leaves no place for personality. This eternal distinction, the mysterious union-in-separateness
									of God and the soul, is a necessary doctrine of all sane mysticism; for no scheme
									which fails to find a place for it can represent more than a fragment of that soul's
									intercourse with the spiritual world. Its affirmation was one of the distinguishing
									features of the Vaishnavite reformation preached by Râmânuja; the principle of which
									had descended through Râmânanda to Kabîr.
								</p>
								<p>
									Last, the warmly human and direct apprehension of God as the supreme Object of love,
									the soul's comrade, teacher, and bridegroom, which is so passionately and frequently
									expressed in Kabîr's poems, balances and controls those abstract tendencies which
									are inherent in the metaphysical side of his vision of Reality: and prevents it
									from degenerating into that sterile worship of intellectual formulæ which became
									the curse of the Vedântist school. For the mere intellectualist, as for the mere
									pietist, he has little approbation. [Footnote: Cf. especially Nos. LIX, LXVII, LXXV,
									XC, XCI.]
								</p>
								<p>
									Love is throughout his "absolute sole Lord": the unique source of the more abundant
									life which he enjoys, and the common factor which unites the finite and infinite
									worlds. All is soaked in love: that love which he described in almost Johannine
									language as the "Form of God." The whole of creation is the Play of the Eternal
									Lover; the living, changing, growing expression of Brahma's love and joy. As these
									twin passions preside over the generation of human life, so "beyond the mists of
									pleasure and pain" Kabîr finds them governing the creative acts of God. His manifestation
									is love; His activity is joy. Creation springs from one glad act of affirmation:
									the Everlasting Yea, perpetually uttered within the depths of the Divine Nature.
									[Footnote: Nos. XVII, XXVI, LXXVI, LXXXII.]
								</p>
								<p>
									In accordance with this concept of the universe as a Love-Game which eternally goes
									forward, a progressive manifestation of Brahma&mdash;one of the many notions which
									he adopted from the common stock of Hindu religious ideas, and illuminated by his
									poetic genius&mdash;movement, rhythm, perpetual change, forms an integral part of
									Kabîr's vision of Reality. Though the Eternal and Absolute is ever present to his
									consciousness, yet his concept of the Divine Nature is essentially dynamic. It is
									by the symbols of motion that he most often tries to convey it to us: as in his
									constant reference to dancing, or the strangely modern picture of that Eternal Swing
									of the Universe which is "held by the cords of love." [Footnote: No. XVI.]</p>
								<p>
									It is a marked characteristic of mystical literature that the great contemplatives,
									in their effort to convey to us the nature of their communion with the supersensuous,
									are inevitably driven to employ some form of sensuous imagery: coarse and inaccurate
									as they know such imagery to be, even at the best. Our normal human consciousness
									is so completely committed to dependence on the senses, that the fruits of intuition
									itself are instinctively referred to them. In that intuition it seems to the mystics
									that all the dim cravings and partial apprehensions of sense find perfect fulfilment.
									Hence their constant declaration that they <i>see</i> the uncreated light, they
									<i>hear</i> the celestial melody, they <i>taste</i> the sweetness of the Lord, they
									know an ineffable fragrance, they feel the very contact of love. "Him verily seeing
									and fully feeling, Him spiritually hearing and Him delectably smelling and sweetly
									swallowing," as Julian of Norwich has it.
								</p>
								<p>
									In those amongst them who develop psycho-sensorial automatisms, these parallels
									between sense and spirit may present themselves to consciousness in the form of
									hallucinations: as the light seen by Suso, the music heard by Rolle, the celestial
									perfumes which filled St. Catherine of Siena's cell, the physical wounds felt by
									St. Francis and St. Teresa. These are excessive dramatizations of the symbolism
									under which the mystic tends instinctively to represent his spiritual intuition
									to the surface consciousness. Here, in the special sense-perception which he feels
									to be most expressive of Reality, his peculiar idiosyncrasies come out.</p>
								<p>
									Now Kabîr, as we might expect in one whose reactions to the spiritual order were
									so wide and various, uses by turn all the symbols of sense. He tells us that he
									has "seen without sight" the effulgence of Brahma, tasted the divine nectar, felt
									the ecstatic contact of Reality, smelt the fragrance of the heavenly flowers. But
									he was essentially a poet and musician: rhythm and harmony were to him the garments
									of beauty and truth. Hence in his lyrics he shows himself to be, like Richard Rolle,
									above all things a musical mystic. Creation, he says again and again, is full of
									music: it <i>is</i> music.
								</p>
								<p>
									At the heart of the Universe "white music is blossoming": love weaves the melody,
									whilst renunciation beats the time. It can be heard in the home as well as in the
									heavens; discerned by the ears of common men as well as by the trained senses of
									the ascetic. Moreover, the body of every man is a lyre on which Brahma, "the source
									of all music," plays. Everywhere Kabîr discerns the "Unstruck Music of the Infinite"&mdash;that
									celestial melody which the angel played to St. Francis, that ghostly symphony which
									filled the soul of Rolle with ecstatic joy. [Footnote: Nos. XVII, XVIII, XXXIX,
									XLI, LIV, LXXVI, LXXXIII, LXXXIX, XCVII.]
								</p>
								<p>
									The one figure which he adopts from the Hindu Pantheon and constantly uses, is that
									of Krishna the Divine Flute Player. [Footnote: Nos. L, LIII, LXVIII.] He sees the
									supernal music, too, in its visual embodiment, as rhythmical movement: that mysterious
									dance of the universe before the face of Brahma, which is at once an act of worship
									and an expression of the infinite rapture of the Immanent God.'</p>
								<p>
									Yet in this wide and rapturous vision of the universe Kabîr never loses touch with
									diurnal existence, never forgets the common life. His feet are firmly planted upon
									earth; his lofty and passionate apprehensions are perpetually controlled by the
									activity of a sane and vigorous intellect, by the alert commonsense so often found
									in persons of real mystical genius. The constant insistence on simplicity and directness,
									the hatred of all abstractions and philosophizings, [Footnote: Nos. XXVI, XXXII,
									LXXVI] the ruthless criticism of external religion: these are amongst his most marked
									characteristics. God is the Root whence all manifestations, "material" and "spiritual,"
									alike proceed; [Footnote: Nos. LXXV, LXXVIII, LXXX, XC.] and God is the only need
									of man&mdash;"happiness shall be yours when you come to the Root." [Footnote: No.
									LXXX.]
								</p>
								<p>
									Hence to those who keep their eye on the "one thing needful," denominations, creeds,
									ceremonies, the conclusions of philosophy, the disciplines of asceticism, are matters
									of comparative indifference. They represent merely the different angles from which
									the soul may approach that simple union with Brahma which is its goal; and are useful
									only in so faras they contribute to this consummation. So thorough-going is Kabîr's
									eclecticism, that he seems by turns Vedântist and Vaishnavite, Pantheist and Transcendentalist,
									Brâhman and Sûfî.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the effort to tell the truth about that ineffable apprehension, so vast and yet
									so near, which controls his life, he seizes and twines together&mdash;as he might
									have woven together contrasting threads upon his loom&mdash;symbols and ideas drawn
									from the most violent and conflicting philosophies and faiths. All are needed, if
									he is ever to suggest the character of that One whom the Upanishad called "the Sun-coloured
									Being who is beyond this Darkness": as all the colours of the spectrum are needed
									if we would demonstrate the simple richness of white light.
								</p>
								<p>
									In thus adapting traditional materials to his own use he follows a method common
									amongst the mystics; who seldom exhibit any special love for originality of form.
									They will pour their wine into almost any vessel that comes to hand: generally using
									by preference&mdash;and lifting to new levels of beauty and significance&mdash;the
									religious or philosophic formulæ current in their own day. Thus we find that some
									of Kabîr's finest poems have as their subjects the commonplaces of Hindu philosophy
									and religion: the Lîlâ or Sport of God, the Ocean of Bliss, the Bird of the Soul,
									Mâyâ, the Hundred-petalled Lotus, and the "Formless Form."
								</p>
								<p>
									Many, again, are soaked in Sûfî imagery and feeling. Others use as their material
									the ordinary surroundings and incidents of Indian life: the temple bells, the ceremony
									of the lamps, marriage, suttee, pilgrimage, the characters of the seasons; all felt
									by him in their mystical aspect, as sacraments of the soul's relation with Brahma.
									In many of these a particularly beautiful and intimate feeling for Nature is shown.
									[Footnote: Nos. XV, XXIII, LXVII, LXXXVII, XCVII.]</p>
								<p>
									In the collection of songs here translated there will be found examples which illustrate
									nearly every aspect of Kabîr's thought, and all the fluctuations of the mystic's
									emotion: the ecstasy, the despair, the still beatitude, the eager self-devotion,
									the flashes of wide illumination, the moments of intimate love. His wide and deep
									vision of the universe, the "Eternal Sport" of creation (LXXXII), the worlds being
									"told like beads" within the Being of God (XIV, XVI, XVII, LXXVI), is here seen
									balanced by his lovely and delicate sense of intimate communion with the Divine
									Friend, Lover, Teacher of the soul (X, XI, XXIII, XXXV, LI, LXXXV, LXXXVI, LXXXVIII,
									XCII, XCIII; above all, the beautiful poem XXXIV).
								</p>
								<p>
									As these apparently paradoxical views of Reality are resolved in Brâhma, so all
									other opposites are reconciled in Him: bondage and liberty, love and renunciation,
									pleasure and pain (XVII, XXV, XL, LXXIX). Union with Him is the one thing that matters
									to the soul, its destiny and its need (LI, I, II, LIV, LXX, LXXIV, XCIII, XCVI);
									and this union, this discovery of God, is the simplest and most natural of all things,
									if we would but grasp it (XLI, XLVI, LVI, LXXII, LXXVI, LXXVIII, XCVII). The union,
									however, is brought about by love, not by knowledge or ceremonial observances (XXXVIII,
									LIV, LV, LIX, XCI); and the apprehension which that union confers is ineffable&mdash;"neither
									This nor That," as Ruysbroeck has it (IX, XLVI, LXXVI).
								</p>
								<p>
									Real worship and communion is in Spirit and in Truth (XL, XLI, LVI, LXIII, LXV,
									LXX), therefore idolatry is an insult to the Divine Lover (XLII, LXIX) and the devices
									of professional sanctity are useless apart from charity and purity of soul (LIV,
									LXV, LXVI). Since all things, and especially the heart of man, are God-inhabited,
									God-possessed (XXVI, LVI, LXXVI, LXXXIX, XCVII), He may best be found in the here-and-now:
									in the normal. human, bodily existence, the "mud" of material life (III, IV, VI,
									XXI, XXXIX, XL, XLIII, XLVIII, LXXII).
								</p>
								<p>
									"We can reach the goal without crossing the road" (LXXVI)&mdash;not the cloister
									but the home is the proper theatre of man's efforts: and if he cannot find God there,
									he need not hope for success by going farther afield. "In the home is reality."
									There love and detachment, bondage and freedom, joy and pain play by turns upon
									the soul; and it is from their conflict that the Unstruck Music of the Infinite
									proceeds. Kabîr says: "None but Brahma can evoke its melodies."</p>
								<p>
									"This version of Kabîr's songs is chiefly the work of
									<strong>Mr. Rabîndranâth Tagore</strong>
									, the trend of whose mystical genius makes him&mdash;as all who read these poems
									will see&mdash;a peculiarly sympathetic interpreter of Kabîr's vision and thought.
									It has been based upon the printed Hindî text with Bengali translation of Mr. Kshiti
									Mohan Sen; who has gathered from many sources&mdash;sometimes from books and manuscripts,
									sometimes from the lips of wandering ascetics and minstrels&mdash;a large collection
									of poems and hymns to which Kabîr's name is attached, and carefully sifted the authentic
									songs from the many spurious works now attributed to him. These painstaking labours
									alone have made the present undertaking possible.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have also had before us a manuscript English translation of 116 songs made by
									Mr. Ajit Kumâr Chakravarty from Mr. Kshiti Mohan Sen's text, and a prose essay upon
									Kabîr from the same hand. From these we have derived great assistance. A considerable
									number of readings from the translation have been adopted by us; whilst several
									of the facts mentioned in the essay have been incorporated into this introduction.
									Our most grateful thanks are due to Mr. Ajit Kumar Chakravarty for the extremely
									generous and unselfish manner in which he has placed his work at our disposal.</p>
