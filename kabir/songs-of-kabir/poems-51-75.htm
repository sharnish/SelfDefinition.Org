									Dear friend, I am eager to meet my Beloved! My youth has flowered, and the pain

									I am wandering yet in the alleys of knowledge without purpose, but I have received

									I have a letter from my Beloved: in this letter is an unutterable message, and now

									The night is dark; the hours slip by. Because my Lord is absent, I start up and

									In the midst of the chamber the harp of joy is gently and sweetly played; and where

								</p>
								<p>
									If you have not drunk of the nectar of that One Love, what

									The Kazi is searching the words of the Koran, and instructing others; but if his

									The Yogi dyes his garments with red; but if he knows naught of that colour of love,

									Subtle is the path of love!

								<p>
									Therein there is no asking and no not-asking, There one loses one's self at His
									feet, There one is immersed in the joy of the seeking; plunged in the deeps of love
									as the fish in the water.

									The lover is never slow in offering his head for his Lord's service.

									Who does not make you close the doors, and hold the breath, and renounce the world;
									Who makes you perceive the Supreme Spirit wherever the mind attaches itself; Who
									teaches you to be still in the midst of all your activities.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ever immersed in bliss, having no fear in his mind, he keeps the spirit of union
									in the midst of all enjoyments. The infinite dwelling of the Infinite Being is everywhere:
									in earth, water, sky, and air.
								</p>
								<p>
									Firm as the thunderbolt, the seat of the seeker is established above the void.

									Receive that Word from which the Universe springeth!

								<p>
									That word is the Guru; I have heard it, and become the disciple. How many are there
									who know the meaning of that word?</p>
								<p>
									O Sadhu! practise that Word!
								</p>
								<p>
									The Vedas and the Puranas proclaim it, The world is established in it, The Rishis
									and devotees speak of it. But none knows the mystery of the Word,
								</p>
								<p>
									The householder leaves his house when he hears it, The ascetic comes back to love
									when he hears it, The Six Philosophies expound it, The Spirit of Renunciation points
									to that Word. From that Word the world-form has sprung; That Word reveals all.

								</p>
								<p>
									Put thy cleverness away: mere words shall never unite thee to Him.

									Do not deceive thyself with the witness of the Scriptures; Love is something other

									Do not follow the mirage on foot, but thirst for the nectar; Dhruva, Prahlad, and

									The saints are drunk with love, their thirst is for love.

									Kabîr says: "Listen to me, brother! The nest of fear is broken. Not for a moment

									O brother! when I was forgetful, my true Guru showed me the Way.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then I left off all rites and ceremonies, I bathed no more in the holy water; Then
									I learned that it was I alone who was mad, and the whole world beside me was sane;
									and I had disturbed these wise people.
								</p>
								<p>
									From that time forth I knew no more how to roll in the dust in obeisance. I do not
									ring the temple bell; I do not set the idol on its throne; I do not worship the

								<p>
									It is not the austerities that mortify the flesh which are pleasing to the Lord;
									When you leave off your clothes and kill your senses, you do not please the Lord.

									The man who is kind and who practises righteousness, who remains passive amidst
									the affairs of the world, who considers all creatures on earth as his own self,
									He attains the Immortal Being, the true God is ever with him.

									The Yogi dyes his garments, instead of dyeing his mind in the colours of love.

								<p>
									He sits within the temple of the Lord, leaving Brahma to worship a stone. He pierces
									holes in his ears, he has a great beard and matted locks, he looks like a goat;
									He goes forth into the wilderness, killing all his desires, and turns himself into
									an eunuch; He shaves his head and dyes his garments; he reads the Gîtâ and becomes
									a mighty talker.
