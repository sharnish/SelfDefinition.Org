                                Mind, through ignorance and indiscrimination, considers its false personality to be true and thinks it is the doer of all Karmas and thus becomes egoistic. It imagines that it is in bondage. It identifies itself with the Jivatman <span class="note">[the individual soul]</span>; it becomes Jivatman itself and takes the responsibility upon itself for doing good or bad Karmas and enjoying or suffering from their fruits. Hence is mind the doer of Karmas (actions) and responsibility for the Karmas, therefore, rests with it.
                            </p>

                                Mind is the stealer of Atman <span class="note">[eternal consciousness]</span>. It is a thief. Mind drags the Jivatman into Vishayas (sensual enjoyments). Jivatman is the Abhasa of Chaitanya, or reflected intelligence in mind. Mind and Jivatman always live together. They cannot be separated. Slay the mind, the stealer of Atman, through Vichara, <sup>[1, 2]</sup> Manana <span class="note">[contemplation]</span> and Nididhyasana (constant and profound meditation) on Brahman.

                                Destruction of the mind does not mean annihilation of the Self. The Vedantins divide the mind into the higher and the lower, of which the lower one leading to desires is asked to be destroyed.

                                Manonasa is of two kinds, viz., (i) Svarupa Manonasa, destruction of the Svarupa of mind, as in the case of the Jivanmukta and (ii) Arupa Manonasa, destruction of the very form of the mind, as in the case of Videhamuktas, when they leave off their physical bodies. The first is termed "destruction of the mind with form <span class="note">[svarupa]</span>." The second is termed "destruction of the mind without form <span class="note">[arupa]</span>."

The cutting off the branches is only secondary. The eradication of the tree by removal of 'I' is the primary thing. Therefore, if through virtuous actions you destroy the idea of 'I' which forms the very root of the tree of mind, then it will not spring up again.

                                The mind can be controlled either through the control of Prana (Hatha Yogic method) or the arrest of the fluctuation of the mind (Raja-Yogic method, the "Yogas-chittavrittinirodhah" of Maharshi Patanjali). <sup>[16, 17]</sup> Control of mind leads to stoppage of breath and control of breath leads to stoppage of mind, because Prana and mind are under one Sambandha <span class="note">[relationship]</span>. During meditation, the breathing becomes very slow. Those who practise meditation may be aware of this fact. This goes to show that when the mind is concentrated, Prana stops by itself without any effort.

                                Manolaya is a temporary absorption of the mind in the object of meditation. When you meditate on the form of Bhagavan Sri Krishna, the mind becomes absorbed in the form of Bhagavan Sri Krishna temporarily.
