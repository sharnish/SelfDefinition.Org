								Happy is the man
								<br /> Who knows neither his own weight, strength
								<br /> Nor destiny.
								<br /> But whose emotions awaken
								<br /> At every turn of the road.
								<br /> Who enjoys a lifelong time of appreciation,
								<br /> With every aspiration guarded.
								<br /> Who spends his interest on inheritance,
								<br /> And at death's door finds his capital
								<br /> Of soul untouched.
								<br /> That man is a man
								<br /> Who follows in the shadow of the Master.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								The man who has a purpose in life,
								<br /> Who lives in silence,
								<br /> Who visualizes no other,
								<br /> Will surely attain it.
								<br /> He is poised on his toes,
								<br /> He is ever ready to spring,
								<br /> His patience and silence in waiting are his greatest activity.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Don't let your memory of past failure or discord
								<br /> Swerve you from your set purpose of possibilities still unborn.
								<br /> Forget by remembering future possibilities.
								<br /> Think only of success,
								<br /> And not only will you feed it,
								<br /> But you will starve failure.
								<br /> You can deform education and music,
								<br /> But simplicity of purpose is like a large reservoir
								<br /> With water gates made of concrete and steel
								<br /> To allow only enough water to pass through
								<br /> To harmonize with Nature's progress of production and consumption,
								<br /> That it may neither run dry,
								<br /> Nor become a flood to destroy.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								The man who labors in silence and darkness
								<br /> Possesses more power
								<br /> Than he who holds high his hand in broad daylight
								<br /> And proclaims his intentions.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								In everything that appears good, you may find bad.
								<br /> A gun may protect you, also kill you.
								<br /> A knife has its use for or against you.
								<br /> Electricity may be your servant, and also destroy you.
								<br /> Food can give health, also sickness.
								<br /> Small-pox virus may make you immune, but too much will cause your death.
								<br /> Too much of any good thing will destroy your equilibrium, your physical poise, or mental balance.
								<br /> Your body is supposed to represent the earth
								<br /> In all its parts, harmoniously, in beauty and strength;
								<br /> The most enduring, artistic, graceful, compact, complete mansion
								<br /> Where the soul may live as the King of the Earth.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you play fair,
								<br /> Regardless how you lose, you win.
								<br /> You may have a poor partner to make you lose today;
								<br /> But tomorrow you will have a better partner than you are,
								<br /> Who will win for you what you lost today
								<br /> Just because you were or would have been a good loser,
								<br /> Having done the best you could.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
							</p>
							<p>
								The more strings you find to the human harp,
								<br /> The greater your song of emotions, happiness, and success.
								<br /> So search for each string hidden.
								<br /> See to it that it is tuned correctly.
								<br /> Then you may hear every song ever sung.
							</p>
							<p>
								You need but to listen,
								<br /> And each mental faculty will vibrate its secret of life.
								<br /> Listen only, for your voice can only repeat,
								<br /> And you will know why the wise men are often silent.
								<br /> They are listening to the voice of growth, life, and God's message.
							</p>
							<p>
								Do you envy the success of others;
								<br /> Complain at your misfortune?
								<br /> If so, bear in mind that there is no living thing
								<br /> That must not work in darkness of the mines.
								<br /> Even the Embryo of the life within its prison walls of shell or flesh
								<br /> The roots of flowers and trees,
								<br /> Man in the dark ages of ignorance.
							</p>
							<p>
								He digs up his metal for swords and plowshares, locks and powder
								<br /> If he fails to wear a crown that fits him,
								<br /> It was then like the tree that complained that it failed to blossom,
								<br /> Because it did not labor among its roots to produce them,
								<br /> Let alone the fruits longing to follow the blossoms unto life.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								When God can trust His creation
								<br /> He will place in Man's hand
								<br /> A most precious power
								<br /> To create what he will.
								<br /> And when Man realizes this
								<br /> He will have burned out
								<br /> All inclination to do wrong.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Often men think they are making great progress
								<br /> Because their feet carrying big loads run swiftly;
								<br /> But are blind to the fact that they are in a revolving squirrel cage getting nowhere;
								<br /> And the man sincere, working daily, sees no progress
								<br /> Because he is traveling on the large ship of Progress, unaware.
							</p>

								It is not enough that we write a letter.
								<br /> We must have the address, buy a stamp and mail it.
								<br /> It is not enough to love.
								<br /> We must repay.
								<br /> Not enough to earn money.
								<br /> We must spend it well.
								<br /> Not enough to pray.
								<br /> We must give prayer muscle to attain.
								<br /> It is not enough to possess a steel bar to make a compass,
								<br /> We need a prayer of magnetism to discern.
							</p>
							<p>
								A prayer is but to tune in so we may realize a duty of Nature.
								<br /> To show us the land-marks to obey a law
								<br /> That we might live right, according to that which created our being and consciousness.
								<br /> Our prayer is but a hammer to the chisel,
								<br /> Hope to faith, internal light in the dark nights of doubt and despair.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the birth of hope
								<br /> That faith may lead us to its realization,
								<br /> To admit a supreme Being,
								<br /> A law greater than our conception,
								<br /> To recognize a power we must obey,
								<br /> A wall of obedience; a recipe,
								<br /> Directions to attain that which will fill a vacuum,
								<br /> A felt want to complete an Ideal.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Calamities and misfortunes are but brakes applied to your freight train going down your mountainside;
								<br /> Or sand thrown across the path of your sled that has no brakes,
								<br /> In order to slow up your speed,
								<br /> So you may reason why and where you are going to land, before it is too late.
								<br /> Nature uses this means of vaccination while still in your prime
								<br /> And strong enough to avoid and withstand the vicissitudes of life.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Don't condemn a fool for lack of wisdom.
								<br /> He is at least contented,
								<br /> While a man of wisdom may be happy,
								<br /> But the law of adjustment gives him a personal responsibility,
								<br /> Which prevents what constitutes the contentment of a fool.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Try to remember everything
								<br /> On your journey up the mountain of life,
								<br /> So that when you glide coasting down
								<br /> You may know what to do, and avoid,
								<br /> In order to complete your life successfully.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If your mind is not in your exercise,
								<br /> Your heart not in your love,
								<br /> You are but putting a losing, useless drain upon your energy &ndash;
								<br /> A false hope in your Ideals.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								No man need envy another.
								<br /> Nature has so constructed its laws
								<br /> That each man may create and live in a world of his own;
								<br /> And as with the stars of heaven,
								<br /> Need injure none by contact, though living in one mansion.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Do not fear to do wrong.
								<br /> Fear rather that you might fail
								<br /> To do good.
								<br /> Do not think you have lost,
								<br /> What you have never found.
								<br /> For there is nothing ever lost,
								<br /> Or ever found.
								<br /> If we have "found",
								<br /> It belongs to another.
								<br /> If we have "lost",
								<br /> It was never ours.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								We still have more to learn
								<br /> Of the rooms of man's mind,
								<br /> To find the doors leading to that religious ecstacy,
								<br /> The mystery, the frenzy of the aborigines,
								<br /> The bliss of divinity felt by martyrs and saints,
								<br /> The hypnotic power of our professional men
								<br /> All still in its infancy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Who shall dare to ridicule or challenge unknown facts,
								<br /> The vehicle which led the human race to absolute facts,
								<br /> The few that we have,
								<br /> Still, self-evident.
								<br /> Can we not be charitable enough
								<br /> To believe men sincere in their own honest convictions?
								<br /> Time will prove a greater power in man's mind
								<br /> Than we have thus far admitted.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								You may assume vows before the eyes of men,
								<br /> But the vows before the eye of your soul
								<br /> Are more sacred and binding by your conscience than any others.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Every man and woman is placed in a melting pot of life,
								<br /> Sorted according to his ambition.
								<br /> The fire of experience either burns them to dross
								<br /> Or purifies to achieve.
								<br /> He who possesses character need not fear the flame of elimination;
								<br /> But those who have cause to fear are but returned to whence fear lost confidence.
								<br /> They are depreciated for their assumed credit.
								<br /> For every plant there grows an affinity
								<br /> Upon which it may live and thrive,
								<br /> Be it food or love, to destroy or to save.
