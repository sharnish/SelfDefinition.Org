								It is better and safer to shape and build your cocoon with own hands and material,
								<br /> Instead of borrowing from your thoughtless neighbor
								<br /> Who not only needs his own material but gives you what is unfit for your protection &ndash;
								<br /> Providing you expect the wings to carry you from the blossom of achievements to the fruits of understanding.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Because you think you have no chance to make good,
								<br /> Don't give up;
								<br /> For who told you that anyone was better than you are
								<br /> If you did not make comparison
								<br /> With someone you thought greater than you?
								<br /> Why not let them
								<br /> Really compare their achievements with yours
								<br /> And see where you stand?
								<br /> And then, if they were in your place,
								<br /> Where really is the goal
								<br /> That you both are traveling for?
								<br /> Just wait until you both get inside
								<br /> Of the bright lights of the City,
								<br /> And let's see the paces of both of you.
								<br /> That is the time you make your speed.
								<br /> And there are more country miles than city miles.
								<br /> So come on and "click."

								Forget past failures by remembering future possibilities.

								We are just what we are
								<br /> And can make ourselves what we intend to
								<br /> If our intentions are sincere.
								<br /> A man without a want
								<br /> Is a ship without a rudder or compass.
								<br /> And a man with a real want
								<br /> Has already sensed
								<br /> The laurel leaves of Victory;
								<br /> Has already inhaled the fragrant rose
								<br /> Of the seed he is about to plant.
								<br /> And if I am able to do this,
								<br /> Then every human being is able to do likewise
								<br /> For we are all constituted alike.
								<br /> We all possess the seven prismatic colors with which to paint
								<br /> Nature.
								<br /> We all possess the seven notes of music
								<br /> So that we may sing and hear.
								<br /> We all live through the seven epochs of
								<br /> Seven years each of life.
								<br /> And we labor six days in the week, to rest
								<br /> Upon the seventh.
								<br /> And we sit outdoors after a terrific storm
								<br /> To behold the rainbow of seven colors
								<br /> That tries to teach us of its message
								<br /> Which was created for man and woman alone.
								<br /> How futile it would be for an artist to create
								<br /> A masterpiece with a primary color lacking;
								<br /> For a musician to interpret life
								<br /> With only three notes.
								<br /> And it is thus with those who have failed.
								<br /> They have failed to find
								<br /> And make use of the seven opportunities
								<br /> Which they possess.

								Intuitive people think the same thoughts. It is neither coincidence nor telepathy when two radios, attuned to the same broadcast, play the same tune.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								We have no right to starve our emotions.
								<br /> We have need of them all
								<br /> If only to counteract certain resultant evils.
								<br /> But if you would succeed as you should
								<br /> Be sure to hire a caretaker
								<br /> For each emotion that manifests itself
								<br /> Above normal.

								Most people seldom drink from their own springs of Inspiration.
								<br /> They drink from their neighbor's stagnant pool of waste,
								<br /> Allowing their own spring of running water
								<br /> The water of life &ndash; to dry up.
								<br /> Our own spring of water
								<br /> Will flow only when we use the water
								<br /> And when the mouth of the spring is kept clean
								<br /> And clear of debris.
								<br /> By wrong thinking we merely exist.
								<br /> By right thinking we drink of the pure waters of life.

								When a good soldier kneels to pray
								<br /> Before the battle,
								<br /> He does not expect God's legions
								<br /> To fight his battle.
								<br /> He expects to be inspired
								<br /> By the sense of justice
								<br /> And then, himself, to do the fighting
								<br /> That is required of him.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								It is well to endure a little sorrow, to give birth to pity, sympathy, mercy, charity and love.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Sit down and meditate; from within, a new world shall be born &ndash; in place of what you have been forced to accept.

								I would rather make keys to unlock doors
								<br /> Than locks to lock them.
								<br /> The man who locks up riches is in danger of losses always.
								<br /> He who makes keys can look forward to profits.
								<br /> He encourages production, honesty, circulation and progress.
								<br /> The man who locks up riches, does so only for self-gratification,
								<br /> Which encourages men to become dishonest, covetous, selfish and criminal.
								<br /> If we think we have the most perfect metal, or organization, and hoard it up,
								<br /> How can there be improvements?
								<br /> If preventive measures are used, why not encourage even the beggar to give up his mental secrets to mankind,
								<br /> Instead of making a criminal of him by discouragement.
								<br /> Give every man a chance, and he will make or break himself,
								<br /> And not be only a beggar,
								<br /> But either a man or nothing at all.

								Many a child is lost on the broad sea of life by the mother's selfish love,
								<br /> Depriving her child of that compass of free action and search for self-reliance,
								<br /> That only means wreckage or slavery when that mother passes on with that compass &ndash; her child's individuality.
							</p>

							<p>
								Man, in idleness, makes food for his master,
								<br /> Losing sight of its mission
								<br /> Which, far from being ornamental,
								<br /> Is to be a necessity in his activity.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Is it not gratifying to rest?
								<br /> But how can one enjoy rest if he is not tired?
								<br /> How become honestly tired without labor?
								<br /> And why labor without reward?
								<br /> And how can one accept reward without earning it,
								<br /> When it must he paid for in full?
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Try to live so that the unseen world may have more respect for you than those who flatter you, in order to forget your virtues and make you forget their sins.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If indeed the sparrows's fall is recorded
								<br /> Then the prayer of a child of God
								<br /> Will surely reach on High
								<br /> And be answered,
								<br /> Even though the answer comes
								<br /> At the pace of a snail.
							</p>

								It is the green lithe limb that bends before the wind of adversity.
								<br /> When the proud, stiff limb refuses, and is torn off.

							<hr>

								When I go into a church, I make-believe the Master is there.
								<br /> And then I don't ask him for anything.
								<br /> I thank him for what I have.

							<p>
								Are things worthwhile?
								<br /> Then make yourself a part of those things with which you wish to be identified.
								<br /> And they cannot exist with you.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Condemnation, ridicule and envy are always made use of
								<br /> In trying to prevent a real man from climbing the ladder of success.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								It is often your superfluous energy that gets you into trouble:
								<br /> Your extra money to gamble, into problems.
								<br /> So make good use of it by controlling the impulse of extravagance, waste, and mere chance.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								It is as we cast our bread upon the waters
								<br /> That counts,
								<br /> And not the returns we expect to get.
								<br /> We are paid for each kind act or deed,
								<br /> The gold is at the end of the rainbow.
								<br /> But think not at all of the earnings,
								<br /> Beware of spiritual greed.
								<br /> And in a mad race let us not dissipate
								<br /> Our strength indiscreetly
								<br /> And be prevented from furthering the greater work.
								<br /> Some are called to be sheep,
								<br /> Some are called to be shepherds,
								<br /> Some hunger &ndash; others feed.
								<br /> But though we are asked for bread,
								<br /> We must also eat and drink
								<br /> That our strength may sustain us
								<br /> To fulfil the law of evolution
								<br /> And that we may tread the road
								<br /> Leading to Eternity.
								<br /> And then will the rainbow
								<br /> Be a halo about the head
								<br /> Of a Child of God.
