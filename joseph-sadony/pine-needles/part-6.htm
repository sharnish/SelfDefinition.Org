								There are sorrows which time alone can cure
								<br /> By what light we find appertaining to Eternity.
								<br /> When we deliberately close one eyelid, we do not destroy the light,
								<br /> But only shut it from our own view.
								<br /> That light which but reflects itself, lends its truth,
								<br /> Brings out the soul of that which it touches.
								<br /> So keep your eyes open.
								<br /> At best they see but dimly.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								It is the sculptor who hews the hardest stone,
								<br /> The writer who uses the most permanent ink,
								<br /> And the philosopher the most simple truths,
								<br /> Who rides the tempests and survives the dark ages of time...
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								As we think and act, so are we.
								<br /> Our thoughts leave an indelible mark upon our features,
								<br /> While our actions leave monuments
								<br /> In the graveyards of the memories of others.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								An intelligent man fears an ignorant man
								<br /> Because of that ignorant man's ignorance.
								<br /> An ignorant man fears an intelligent man
								<br /> Because of that knowledge the intelligent man possesses is unknown to the ignorant.
								<br /> The suspicions of the ignorant create fear that weakens.
								<br /> The intelligent man is aware of that weakness,
								<br /> So is strengthened.

								Which plant or bulb in the human garden
								<br /> Do you water and cultivate most?
								<br /> What blossoms are most pleasing to you?
								<br /> Cultivate all,
								<br /> Until each blooms
								<br /> To your own satisfaction;
								<br /> And then you will KNOW
								<br /> What constitutes your creation.

								If you assume the adoption of a child, be sure that you do your duty as a parent, and it may be a better child to you than your own, and even teach you how to be a good father or mother.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Obey the simple things of life
								<br /> And the big things will not overthrow you.
								<br /> Choose the correct grains of sand,
								<br /> And the house of bricks will not crumble.
								<br /> Likewise with an army.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								We have been given just so much energy, like money, to spend as we will, or throw away.
								<br /> What shall we do with it?
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								To believe in a God
								<br /> Is the most perfect principle
								<br /> To attain perfection.
								<br /> To imitate a God,
								<br /> The quickest way to attain that which we seek.
								<br /> For it is the wish itself
								<br /> Clothed in reality
								<br /> Which but strives to manifest itself
								<br /> Through Faith,
								<br /> In its own individuality.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I believe that some men
								<br /> Have been made leaders
								<br /> And have been given great missions to perform
								<br /> For Humanity.
								<br /> And it is far better to give to the man
								<br /> One pound of sugar
								<br /> So that he may be better able
								<br /> To carry out the great work
								<br /> Than to give to hundreds and thousands
								<br /> Human beings,
								<br /> One grain each,
								<br /> And have all lost.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								We are all too close to our labor and acquaintances
								<br /> To see truthfully as things really are.
								<br /> Just widen the space and see for yourself.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If your education does not give you contentment, happiness, confidence, and success,
								<br /> You have been cheated.
								<br /> And that by yourself.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Life and history repeat themselves constantly.
								<br /> Go count your cycles, that you may improve, and profit by mistakes.

								A fool, on meeting a Philosopher
								<br /> Will, with arrogance say,
								<br /> "There goes a fool."
								<br /> But the Philosopher smiles sorrowfully,
								<br /> With pity, and answers with humility:
								<br /> "Thou hast said it."
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								There is a first seemingly, insignificant step
								<br /> Unseen,
								<br /> Unknown;
								<br /> Which leads to Heaven or Hell.
								<br /> It is at the point,
								<br /> Where temptation has no string,
								<br /> Where life and death are synonymous.
								<br /> It is at the point
								<br /> Where we may turn future tears
								<br /> Into future smiles.
								<br /> It is at the point
								<br /> Beyond which we are conditioned.
								<br /> Beyond which, &ndash; as we say,
								<br /> We are in the hands of "Fate".
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								He who is wise but humble invites love and respect where a fool has contempt and invites it.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								The real wise man has sought all he knows from within himself; the intellectual man from others.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Man loses sight
								<br /> Of that stupendous law of Progress.
								<br /> He thinks Progress will not go on,
								<br /> Without his egotistical activity;
								<br /> And is startled into realization
								<br /> Only when he sees himself engulfed
								<br /> And strangled by the achievements
								<br /> Of the younger generation,
								<br /> Which ever settle about Old Age.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Measure your sanity
								<br /> By how long your imagination
								<br /> Can remain within the walls
								<br /> Of common sense and reason.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								He who will not be hungry
								<br /> Cannot enjoy an appetite.
								<br /> He who does not love
								<br /> Cannot receive.
								<br /> The only way to receive is to give.
								<br /> He who gives, cleanses himself.
								<br /> He who only takes, decays.
								<br /> An empty room contains
								<br /> The most fresh air.
								<br /> A vacant nest has fulfilled
								<br /> The purpose of Nature.
								<br /> He who would be successful and happy
								<br /> Let him do the labor he can do best,
								<br /> And in his own way.
								<br /> His individuality will place him
								<br /> In his own sphere.
								<br /> For we are all labeled, classified, ordained.
								<br /> Or there would be no beginning,
								<br /> Nor end,
								<br /> Nor birth, nor death, in this life.
								<br /> We all represent the symbol of time.
								<br /> If you would gain knowledge
								<br /> And be wise,
								<br /> Learn from the tongues of babes and fools.
								<br /> Instead of your wise men,
								<br /> Who may know the sun's eclipses
								<br /> Years in advance;
								<br /> The distance of the stars,
								<br /> And the name of every insect;
								<br /> And who, in themselves are not happy,
								<br /> And do not know love's companionship.
								<br /> A child will teach you your needs.
								<br /> A fool, what to avoid.
							</p>

							<p>
								It is easier to prevent a bruise than to heal one. Easier to prevent and control habits by education, than to cure them.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you will remember the following it may solve some of your problems:
							</p>
							<p>
								Does not today's food feed tomorrow's ambition?
								<br /> Then why do you insist upon adding adulteration and flavors
								<br /> To strangle your own special make of bread,
								<br /> So that the owner of your borrowed flavor but claims his own,
								<br /> As well as yours, to his credit.
								<br /> Feed tomorrow's thought with your ambitions and ideals of yesterday;
								<br /> For those ideals are just what you are,
								<br /> And may become what you long for most.
								<br /> They are your choice of food when hungry, if you only know it.
								<br /> Man's taste has been so abused, his desires so misshaped,
								<br /> That he orders a big meal which is served too soon, or too late,
								<br /> His unnatural desires having so much sway that there is no coordination in his entire system
								<br /> Then he bemoans his fate until Nature slows him down by force.
								<br /> Be normal in all things;
								<br /> For the deeper you sink in the ground the more labor,
								<br /> And the less you find but materialism.
								<br /> The higher you fly, the more mysterious clouds of spiritual fanaticism.
								<br /> Still, both may produce a supermind.
								<br /> But the happiest of the three is he who insists on walking on the surface of the earth,
								<br /> With feet among the flowers, heart and head overlooking beauty and happiness.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								You are ready to condemn the man who has made a mistake &ndash;
								<br /> Is it because you envy,
								<br /> But dare not make the same mistake
								<br /> For want of an opportunity?
								<br /> If not, where is your charity and tolerance, pity, and pride
								<br /> For being stronger?
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								A fool can ask a question that a wise man cannot answer.
								<br /> And if he could, the fool would not understand it.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								The strong arm of the sculptor brings into existence the artist's greatest inspiration in the hardest marble.
								<br /> His master-piece may then be lasting, and remembered and loved by future generations...
								<br /> Do you not think it is a law that he who is most valued must be visited by tragedies, tests of endurance, humiliation and sorrow?
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Where is your quest?
								<br /> Do you intend to rush heedlessly over numerous paths and by-paths, or will you remain in your own Soul poised and well-balanced?
								<br /> You may have a light buggy in which you are going to ride around the world.
								<br /> Are you not going to sit in the exact center of that buggy, realizing that the four wheels will carry you safely back home?
								<br /> If you were to sit above one of the wheels only, it surely would be worn out before the other three.
								<br /> And your mission would not be fulfilled.
								<br /> Your quest would be in vain.
								<br /> Common sense is in using every faculty of the brain.
								<br /> Not riding to a judgment on one wheel...
								<br /> Remain in the center of your Soul, where there is an answer to your quest.

								It is not enough to possess power;
								<br /> It is more essential
								<br /> To know how to use it.
								<br /> Do not envy one
								<br /> Who displays it unwisely,
								<br /> For he soon
								<br /> Will be dispossessed of it,
								<br /> As with one
								<br /> Who possesses wealth unguarded.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								A heart of gold has its many temptations &ndash;
								<br /> More so than the heart of stone.

								THERE ONCE WAS A MAN
								<br /> Who was born in the depths of the valley of Nothingness.
								<br /> He beheld the wonderful Sun in the heavens
								<br /> That seemed to give life to all living things.
								<br /> He made himself a vehicle, with a strong pair of tugs.
								<br /> He loaded it with provisions and started up a mountain to be nearer this life-giving thing.
								<br /> But the climb was difficult &ndash; a continuous pull on the tugs.
								<br /> Every once in a while he came across the mistakes of others
								<br /> Who like him endeavored to reach the top, but would slip and spill their load.
								<br /> They would implore him to help them, in exchange for some of their goods.
								<br /> And in the doing of this charity, his muscles became hard as steel;
								<br /> Until at last he had reached the top, to behold the splendor at his feet.
								<br /> But as he turned about, he was astonished
								<br /> To behold a deep valley at his feet and a great mountain before him.
								<br /> For he had but reached the top of a little foothill, called his mortal life.
								<br /> Still he remained for a time, bathing himself in the glory of his achievements
								<br /> Until at last the sun went down.
								<br /> Then the greatest Ambition was born &ndash; to climb the real mountain.
								<br /> Still, how could he descend into the valley, and ascend the next?
								<br /> For he realized that this side of the foothill mountain was as smooth as glass,
								<br /> Where no one could ascend; nor once descended, could one stop his flight,
								<br /> Because this was the valley of death.
								<br /> Here his physical strength did him naught.
								<br /> Still, realizing that the great load he had pulled up to the top would be capitalized with his momentum,
								<br /> He prepared to descend.
								<br /> By the help of his own deeds, and with the swiftness of light was carried down through oblivion.
								<br /> And by the momentum was carried up to the great Mountain of
								<br /> Compensation,
								<br /> To the exact height of the foothill he had just left.
								<br /> And there he stood, firm under foot,
								<br /> And his passage paid for by his deeds and wisdom thus far adopted
								<br /> And now he possessed a continued want, which is the greatest blessing on earth.
								<br /> It is the pull of the compass, a definite fact,
								<br /> The direct road to that place where intense activity become calm and peaceful.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Nature gives birth to nothing to which it does not give sustenance to exist,
								<br /> And protection for a given time,
								<br /> Of which to make use according to the understanding created by experience.
								<br /> The human body is the fertile ground
								<br /> In which the roots of the soul make themselves known,
								<br /> And as with the little colored flag of the plant, the blossom,
								<br /> Introducing an individuality, and the coming of the <span class="nowrap">fruit &ndash;</span>
								<br /> So it is with men and women.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								What is pain
								<br /> If not but a faithful voice of warning
								<br /> Of disobedience to the laws of Nature
								<br /> Under which we exist?
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								A cruel man uses anger
								<br /> To avenge his cowardly blindness.
								<br /> Bear in mind that often, if you don't do,
								<br /> You can't.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Have you ever observed
								<br /> How the needle of a phonograph travels,
								<br /> Touching every point of the record?
								<br /> Why don't you do likewise,
								<br /> With the opportunities of your territory,
								<br /> Which is your record?
								<br /> Why just keep in one depression,
								<br /> Repeating over and over yesterday's activity,
								<br /> Leaving out all the rest of your life's songs;
								<br /> Then complain of its briefness,
								<br /> Until someone else begins where you left off,
								<br /> Only to place the flowers on your coffin
								<br /> Because of songs unsung?
								<br /> Wake up and sing them now.
								<br /> Adjust the needle out of the same rut habit
								<br /> And let the world know that God makes no mistake,
								<br /> But that it is man only, who forgets
								<br /> That which masters try to remind him of.
								<br /> Is it not true ?
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								One must concentrate upon his purpose,
								<br /> Be it what it may,
								<br /> Or make his mind receptive to inspiration upon a chosen subject only,
								<br /> Or he may receive thoughts not essential, but detrimental to his development.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Grief and calamity are two of the finest whips
								<br /> To bring us joy and success.
