								Every man is forced to exist or die. Then why not make your choice where you will live best; for contentment, not momentary pleasure with sorrow, despair and regrets?
							</p>
							<p>
								One can choose his own flower pot to grow in, after leaving nature's great Hot-house: even to choosing those who may admire you and love you for just what you are.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								I dare not tell you of what is really ahead of you.
								<br /> If you knew you would stretch out your arms toward the blue sky with tears in your eyes, and a longing in your heart to fly, to soar upward because of the distant beauty that is yours.
								<br /> I have glimpsed that land of beauty.
								<br /> And have been enamored by its magic.
								<br /> But at times I dare not linger there, for fear of neglecting objectiveness.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you do not labor for a purpose, you place no value on it.
								<br /> For a thing, no matter how precious, is of no value unless you place there yourself by what you would do to obtain it.
								<br /> If you find and win the love of a woman, with but little effort,
								<br /> You will lose her to another, as easily as you won her.
								<br /> But if it required half a lifetime, as in climbing a mountain to its height,
								<br /> You will know the journey down, though more pleasant,
								<br /> Has as many miles of road as going up.
								<br /> So measure your value by what is required to obtain it.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Never profess to do more than you can.
								<br /> The effort to maintain your assertion
								<br /> Will be greater than the reward
								<br /> From your deception.
								<br /> With the same amount of energy
								<br /> You could do better things
								<br /> In your own way
								<br /> The things that are yours to do.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								When disputing over an opinion
								<br /> Why not give your own
								<br /> To match that of your opponent,
								<br /> Rather than to produce none,
								<br /> And only destroy his.
								<br /> Why not give something in return
								<br /> As a friendly bargain,
								<br /> Instead of giving birth
								<br /> To disappointed enemies.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								You say you were never lost? But have you shown the way to others? If not, then you ARE lost.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								How could we exist,
								<br /> Were it not for a purpose?
								<br /> If we do not know that purpose
								<br /> It should be our purpose to seek it,
								<br /> Slowly but surely.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Every man when lost
								<br /> Must find himself
								<br /> Or he will dispute
								<br /> That he was ever lost
								<br /> If someone else
								<br /> Points out the right road.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Before considering being converted or initiated,
								<br /> Do not accept the laws blindly.
								<br /> You may buy that which you cannot support;
								<br /> Obligate yourself to that which you cannot fulfill,
								<br /> Breaking a law assumed without the sanction of your willingness and understanding,
								<br /> Changing your entire makeup to obey the law of another;
								<br /> Sinning for having broken a promise,
								<br /> Assuming a law which will affect even your conscience,
								<br /> Because that law seems to be an inspiration
								<br /> Until you once find yourself in mental nakedness
								<br /> Then you will become its enemy
								<br /> Instead of a tolerant human being.
								<br /> Always be convinced logically and practically,
								<br /> So there will be no residue of a soap bubble left to shame you.
								<br /> How many martyrs have died in the past,
								<br /> Convinced they died for a sacred Cause.
								<br /> But we today call them fanatics, spies, traitors, revolutionists, "ahead of their times",
								<br /> But nevertheless they were truly martyrs
								<br /> Worthy of a crown and of their convictions.
								<br /> Be sure your heart is with your mind,
								<br /> Before you accept in haste
								<br /> Anything that you intend to graft on your tree of life, So when it bears fruit,
								<br /> That branch will not hold fruit that will shame your own;
								<br /> Though your own may be lemons (so essential to life),
								<br /> And your adopted branch peaches
								<br /> God made nothing useless
								<br /> Not even the tail of a pig.
							</p>

								Nature has created our understanding
								<br /> As the embryo of a chick,
								<br /> Within an opaque shell.
								<br /> So it might not, in its development
								<br /> And involuntary growth,
								<br /> Desire those things
								<br /> Outside its own world.
								<br /> This shell is opaque and brittle,
								<br /> Until, by wisdom and knowing,
								<br /> It becomes transparent.
								<br /> Then knowledge removes
								<br /> The superstitious potash, &ndash;
								<br /> Brittleness, &ndash;
								<br /> And makes it transparent,
								<br /> And flexible, &ndash; to shape itself
								<br /> According to its will and emotions.
								<br /> Thus it is with ourselves.
								<br /> As we evolve from ignorance and rigidity
								<br /> Were we to see into the beyond,
								<br /> We could not carry out the creation
								<br /> Of our primitive worlds.
								<br /> As we grow,
								<br /> We tear away the veils,
								<br /> Shaping ourselves according to the niche
								<br /> We are destined to fill.
								<br /> And only by degrees do we become aware
								<br /> Of why our creation.
								<br /> The purpose of all things we question.
								<br /> But the Great Architect
								<br /> Has placed life's answer
								<br /> In every loving form.
								<br /> And we could if we would,
								<br /> Read the messages from the Father
								<br /> To His self-Creating Sons.

								Some men become famously wealthy,
								<br /> Insisting on being in debt.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								The scrubbing brush to a working woman
								<br /> Is as important as the pen
								<br /> To the President of the United States.
								<br /> Never ridicule the flimsy bridge
								<br /> You have just passed over.
								<br /> You may have to use it
								<br /> On your return trip.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If environments cannot be altered, it is well to have a few apparent calamities so that under the law of relativity, one is made to give more value to that which has become commonplace by familiarity.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								The greatest sorrow and tragedy in life
								<br /> Comes to those who seek happiness at the end of the trail
								<br /> Rather than in the making of the trail.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you wish to hold
								<br /> What you think is yours,
								<br /> Be sure that it is paid for.
								<br /> And by your own coin.
								<br /> Remembering, incidentally,
								<br /> That each penny represents its value in deeds.
								<br /> Or your possession is but a debt.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you interest yourself in the roots of a rose, the blossom will be interested in you.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								He who wins friends by frankness
								<br /> Holds them without flattery.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If personality is good salesmanship,
								<br /> Then the salesman
								<br /> Must have sold himself the facts
								<br /> Enough to believe them absolutely
								<br /> To convince the buyer of the facts.
								<br /> Then why not convince teachers and missionaries
								<br /> To convince themselves first,
								<br /> Before trying to convince others
								<br /> Of that which they themselves have certain doubts
								<br /> At least enough so to be sold by those
								<br /> Who do believe, even though they may be mistaken.
								<br /> At least there will be some
								<br /> Who will be entirely convinced of facts
								<br /> By the mistakes made by him
								<br /> Who did believe, and still was mistaken.
								<br /> Be sure you outlive your apprenticeship
								<br /> Before assuming mastership
								<br /> Or some pupil
								<br /> May hail you as an equal
								<br /> To your embarrassment among masters.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Always be yourself.
								<br /> Then you'll know what you are,
								<br /> And what you can be.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you wish the world to follow you,
								<br /> Keep on walking alone without looking back.
								<br /> And when you have reached your goal
								<br /> A multitude will be at your back.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Miracles are not so convincing as the fruits of them.
								<br /> Christ did not convince the leaders of His time,
								<br /> But the fruits of His work convinced the world.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Prevent rather than cure
								<br /> By studying not only that which you're thinking with
								<br /> But the material you have with which to shape that which does your thinking.
								<br /> For your state of mind can be what you will it to be
								<br /> By the right purpose in willing.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Learn how to forget what you should, or will,
								<br /> As well as to remember that which again may be born to you beneficially,
								<br /> So as to correct that mistake you ought to forget in its correction.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								When you ridicule another,
								<br /> You have been blinded by the same vice in a new form
								<br /> As that of which you accuse your victim.
								<br /> Just as he fails to understand his own knowledge of wisdom,
								<br /> Or he whose physical strength makes him arrogant
								<br /> Only to be humiliated by one who may be weak but not aware of it.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								How many people fear to lose their good living
								<br /> By leaving their hypocrisy behind?
								<br /> Who advocates truth so that nobody may question his sincerity
								<br /> Nor expose him to ridicule because of lack of truth?
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Our bad habits make us prisoners, and our false pride is the jailer that keeps us there.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								You are what you are; but can be what you will.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								We always lose sight of what we've got, in our efforts to obtain what we haven't got.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								When adversity comes, it is a sign that we are given a test, or given work to do. The Masters test only those whom they feel to be worthwhile, so as to be sure of results.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you have found some truth,
								<br /> Don't get over-excited and brag about it,
								<br /> Or you may be checked up
								<br /> To prove how ignorant you have been.
								<br /> Rather add it to your stock of knowledge
								<br /> For it is then already accepted,
								<br /> And your word is law,
								<br /> For that is truth.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Thoughts are bound to escape that may be injurious,
								<br /> Your tongue of ill-reproof is evidence of that.
								<br /> Think twice, for and against,
								<br /> Before you think of thoughts you intend to express.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Do well, and conquer your work,
								<br /> However menial,
								<br /> And you will have done
								<br /> What Christ did,
								<br /> When He died upon the Cross.
								<br /> And for the same purpose.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Sit down and meditate: from within, a new world shall be born, in place of what you are forced to accept.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you lose yourself in serving men, God will find you to be served.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								If you can't think it out, you can't act it out.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Each Individual must keep his balance if he wishes to succeed and be happy.
								<br /> And always under some good discipline
								<br /> To adopt a personal mental control governed by logic, reason and justice.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								When the time comes that the public may know and realize what supposedly great men think about instead of what they talk about, you will behold a welcome miracle in the adjustment of man-made laws as influenced by God-made laws.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Don't think for a moment
								<br /> That you can always get away
								<br /> With those things that you try to prevent others getting away with.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Misfortune only follows when we starve our intuition,
								<br /> Or follow the dictates of another into slavery.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								A person who does not improve things is not improving himself.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Did you ever try to change your mind when angry?
								<br /> Try it, and see what you are made of.
								<br /> Don't lock up your reason when it is needed more.
								<br /> When you start in to lick a man,
								<br /> Notice if it is the same man you hit with your first blow.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								As you climb the mountain to success, be sure to look down periodically, as you do upward.
								<br /> It will make you more cautious and sure of your worthiness.
								<br /> It will show you from what rank you came, and to what depths you may fall.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Many a man has been forced to great deeds, who capitalizes unearned reward,
								<br /> While many a worthy martyr died in obscurity
								<br /> To have his name and deeds resurrected in the selfish display of glory
								<br /> That might have saved him to us in untold wisdom.
								<br /> Far rather sustain life and receive living food for knowledge
								<br /> Than only his dead memory of words, with no reply.
								<br /> The world looks big to little men.
								<br /> The world is small to big men.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Many an educated man becomes a fool through a leaky tongue.
								<br /> Many an ocean liner sinks by a slow leak because too insignificant to notice such magnitude.
								<br /> Still, a drop of kerosene in five gallons of milk manifests itself.
								<br /> Let him who is always so ready to dispute the things of the spirit
								<br /> Deny the existence of the evaporated brandy that he ran through his leaky still,
								<br /> And when evaporated into the air
								<br /> Ask him where it is.
								<br /> Or have him color a glass full of alcohol;
								<br /> And later when he finds the glass empty, and only the color remaining,
								<br /> Ask him where it is
								<br /> And if it is not a fact that had he placed his glass full of alcohol in an air-tight room,
								<br /> He would have found it condensed on the floor,
								<br /> To prove that the thing he could not see after it left the glass, was still there.
								<br /> Likewise with spiritual things.
