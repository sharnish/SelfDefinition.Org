                                NO MAN can contribute to the world more than his own personal experience, the harvest
                                of his own research and experiment, unless it be the fruit of inspiration or prophetic
                                insight. The works of Joseph Sadony contain a rich store of both.</p>

                                <em>Gates of the Mind</em> is one of a number of manuscript volumes thus far withheld
                                from publication by the author. Though its subtitle is <em>Proven Psychic Discoveries</em>,
                                various digressions from the narrative reveal that its purpose is not autobiographical.
                                It is an introduction of the anatomy of prophetic intuition. The small book here
                                privately printed is rather less than a "condensation"; it contains but a small
                                portion of the first volume of this unpublished work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Underlying and eclipsing the narrative is a rational of the physiological foundations
                                and scientific investigation of mental phenomena considered as tele-empathic and
                                telepathic phenomena of the human nervous system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is a conclusion of the author and his associates in research that most mystic,
                                psychic, and occult terms used in describing mental phenomena are misleading, that
                                there exist no mysterious "faculties" of a mystic or occult nature, but that the
                                imagination, if used correctly, is capable of portraying past, present, or future
                                events within the limitations imposed by the fact that the imagination is dependent
                                entirely on memory of past sensory experience to provide the elements of its portrayal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, the author claims that the term "thought transference" is a misnomer,
                                that it is impossible for what is usually designated a "thought" to be transferred
                                from one mind to another mind, but that it is possible and of common occurrence
                                to induce in another mind a thought that is similar to one experienced in your own
                                mind, or <em>vice versa</em>. The exact degree of similarity will depend upon the
                                similarity of past experience. The induced thought, however, is entirely the product
                                of the selective simulation of memory elements in an activity of the imagination.
                                The thought is your own, and has not been "transferred" from another mind, even
                                though it be similar in every respect. A phenomenon has taken place, but it is one
                                of thought induction, not thought transference.</p>

                                We are living through a crisis the full extent and meaning of which is realized
                                by only a few. We are and have been witnessing periods of confusion and revolution,
                                not only in world politics, in science, education, industry, and art, but also in
                                psychology, philosophy, and religion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are witnessing and shall witness the collapse of theories and concepts in all
                                fields of thought. No science can continue to stand on its present foundations without
                                adjustments made necessary by the confusion and poverty of existing verbal organization.
                                Neither the philosophies nor the psychologies can withstand the critical application
                                of the operational view with any greater success than the physical sciences. They
                                will be forced to a more strict correlation of <em>Language, Logic, and Life. </em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus we have undergone and are still undergoing a revolution in the physical sciences.
                                Even now new foundations are being laid to complete the bridge extending from atomic
                                to organic, thence to astronomic dimensions. The biologist must know his physics
                                and chemistry as well as his psychology; and a psychologist without knowledge of
                                the former is not worthy of the name. The philosopher who does not know by first-hand
                                research and experimentation these fundaments of life and the physical universe
                                must resign himself to his own amusement, for his mental structures can be only
                                dialectic castles in the air.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The confusion of the age was manifest in the first few sessions of the Conference
                                on Science, Philosophy and Religion at the opening of World War II. The scholars
                                admitted that they were confused, and that they did not know how to "think with
                                a view to action," or how to teach each other to the end of reaching mutual understanding
                                and agreement. As a result they were forced to agree to disagree, to predict a pluralistic
                                instead of a monolithic civilization.</p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Gates of the Mind</em> is the beginning of an answer to the scholars on the part
                                of a student of life and human nature, a seeker for truth and an independent investigator
                                on an experimental basis of the operations of the human mind in relation to physiological
                                and psychological consequences. Here for the first time is the beginning of a detailed
                                account of a personal adventure in the deliberate and purposive development of prophetic
                                intuition, and its application to problems of nature and human nature, science,
                                philosophy, religion, education, industry, war, and peace.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There has been need for an effort on the part of someone capable of experiencing
                                and demonstrating as well as observing so-called psychic and mental phenomena to
                                separate the wheat from the chaff, to paint the picture of just what can and cannot
                                be expected of it in the present state of man's development; to function of man's
                                sympathetic sensitivities from all the technical and psychic "racketeering"; to
                                encourage the individual development of these sensitivities along healthy and constructive
                                lines, and to discourage the authoritarian capitalization of psychological or spiritual
                                truths and the subjugation of peoples by psychological tricks. In this small book
                                is the beginning of Mr. Sadony's answer to this need.

                                From the view of some, a greater importance should be attached to the application
                                of prophetic intuition to fundamental problems of science, philosophy, education,
                                and religion, rather than to elements of mere personal experience. But to the laymen
                                there can be nothing more important than how he can benefit by personal experience,
                                rather than by the acquisition of knowledge or theory concerning the more abstruse
                                problems of science or philosophy.</p>

                                For his benefit, then, who cares little for the deeper problems that might be discussed
                                at greater length, we may conclude this introduction by assuring him that so far
                                as mental phenomena are concerned, together with the conclusions expressed in Mr.
                                Sadony's comments in Gates of the Mind, we are only a few of many who will agree
                                that they have been established with as much certainty for those of us who have
                                participated in the experimental investigation of this subject as the results of
                                our research in the fields of radionics, electrostatics, electro-magnetism, and
                                gravitation.

                                    It matters not <em>who</em> in the world of time the mind may be; Truth imprints
                                    upon its tablet its own law. If that mind is so constituted, it can no more help
                                    reflecting the fact than a mirror can help reflecting the rays of the sun if at

                                    to the human eye that receives it. The receiver is just as important as the sender.</p>
