                                My mother was showing me a picture. She said, "That is where I was born, Joseph."</p>
                            <p>
                                For a minute I looked at it, and it didn't seem right. I said, "But, Mother, shouldn't
                                there be a river over here?" I pointed to the right. "And shouldn't there be a barn
                                besides just a house?"</p>
                            <p>
                                "What makes you say that, Joey? The artist made this just like it was. No, we were
                                away from the river. We had no barn. What makes you say that?"</p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, anyway," I said, "I remember the river, and a barn and a bridge."</p>
                            <p>
                                Mother said, "Joseph, you mustn't talk like that. You never went as far as the river.
                                You couldn't possibly remember it. Besides, that's where your father was born. It
                                was his father who had a - " Suddenly my mother stopped and looked at me biting
                                her lower lip. For a moment she seemed not to see me, though looking right at me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I said, "Mother! What's the matter?"</p>
                            <p>
                                She said, "Joseph, you couldn't possibly remember that, because you were never there,
                                but that's where your father was born, by the river, near a bridge. And your grandfather
                                had a barn, because he had horses. That was on the Rhine, near Coblens."

                                Herman was my only brother, and he was older than I was. When I was seven he was
                                twelve. He was a cripple from birth, but he was beautiful and he was good. I always
                                went to Herman when I didn't understand something and no one else would talk with
                                me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was spring, and we were watching a robin build a nest outside the window.</p>
                            <p>
                                I said, "Do you think that's the same one that built there last year, the nest that
                                fell down when the wind blew this winter?"</p>
                            <p>
                                Herman said, "I think it's maybe one of the young ones that was born in the old
                                nest."</p>
                            <p>
                                I said, "But how would it know? If it was born in the old nest, how would it know
                                how to build a new one? Can a mother robin teach it?"</p>
                            <p>
                                "But how?" I insisted.</p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, they call it instinct, Joey, but what that is I can't tell you. I guess it's
                                born in them because the mother and father knew; back and back so far that nobody
                                knows anything about it."</p>
                            <p>
                                "Herman, do you think we know things because Mother and Father knew them, even if
                                they don't tell us?"</p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, I think maybe we feel things and do things like they did, Joey. I've heard
                                Father say you are sometimes just like Grandpa Jean Marie Felix Reipert. He was
                                a bookbinder, like Uncle, and an artist too, always working with his hands, making
                                things like you do."</p>
                            <p>
                                I said, "Herman, sometimes I feel as if I could almost remember things before I
                                was born. But just when I think I do, I forget it again. Do you ever feel that way?"</p>
                            <p>
                                Herman said, "Well, I know what you mean. It's like a dream. When you wake up you
                                can't remember it, but you know you were dreaming.</p>
                            <p>
                                I said, "Yes, only it's not when I'm asleep, Herman. It's when I'm awake, and when
                                I've been thinking and then stop thinking for a minute. When I start thinking again,
                                it's gone."</p>
                            <p>
                                Herman looked at me a minute and said, "You've always been funny that way, Joey.
                                When you say things without thinking you are usually right, and everyone wonders
                                how you know. But when you think about things you act as if you didn't know anything
                                at all. I suppose you know that sometimes worries Mother, because she's afraid Father
                                won't understand it. He doesn't like that sort of thing one little bit."</p>
                            <p>
                                "But what can I do about it, Herman?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, I wouldn't say too much without thinking when Father is around. It's better
                                when he thinks you're dumb than when he worries, wondering what's got into you.
                                Some day I'll tell you why he worries about it."</p>
                            <p>
                                "Tell me, Herman! Please tell me!"</p>
                            <p>
                                "Ssh! Joey, they'll hear us. I'll tell you sometime when nobody's home but you and
                                me."</p>
                            <p>
                                It was pitch dark and I woke from a nightmare in a cold sweat. I must have cried
                                out in my sleep because Mother had her hand over my mouth, whispering, "Be quiet,
                                Joseph! Don't wake your father. What were you dreaming?"</p>
                            <p>
                                I said, "I dreamed that Herman was hanging on the wall with his arms out, like on
                                a cross. He was nailed there."</p>
                            <p>
                                My mother gasped and said, "Joey! Promise me you won't tell anyone that! Don't tell
                                your father, and don't tell Herman or your sisters."</p>
                            <p>
                                I promised, and then asked, "Why?"</p>
                            <p>
                                "Because," she said, "your father doesn't like such things, and we mustn't think
                                of the or tell about them. But you frighten me."</p>
                            <p>
                                "I'm sorry, Mother."</p>
                            <p>
                                "I'm not blaming you, Joseph. You can't help how strange it is. I dreamed a dream
                                like that about Herman the night you were born, and I didn't dare say anything about
                                it. Because eight months before you were born I started dreaming strange dreams,
                                and they all came true. That never happened to me before, and it has never happened
                                since you were born. But during that time all my dreams came true except that last
                                one about Herman. You're the first I've told, because now you dream it too! Let
                                us say a prayer, Joey, and not tell anyone."</p>
                            <p>
                                So Mother left me, but I didn't sleep. Something troubled me, but I did not know
                                what it was. It was something more than my dream about Herman; something that made
                                me feel all alone in the world, even with a large family.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I lay in the dark; then suddenly something happened to me that I did not comprehend
                                until years later, in memory. The vague distress of an internal conflict I could
                                not understand suddenly vanished. In that moment I gained a new sense of identity.
                                Yet I felt like a stranger in the bosom of my own family. Suddenly I didn't know
                                who I was, and lay there in the dark asking myself, "Who am I? Where am I? How did
                                I get here?"</p>
                            <p>
                                But there was no uneasiness in the sensation; rather a sense of impending excitement,
                                as if I had entered a new world and could hardly wait to explore it. Somewhere in
                                this new world a treasure was hidden, and I would find it. For some reason my heart
                                was glowing as if I had fallen in love with something I couldn't see. All my inner
                                senses were affected by this, so that strong, tender arms picked me up, but I could
                                see no face because I was suddenly tired, and suddenly safe. When I woke it was
                                morning.
                            </p>
                            <p class="center">

                                The world was the same, after all; but something inside of me was different. I felt
                                happy about something and didn't know why, I saw more than I usually did. I stopped
                                to look at things that I usually passed by; and when I looked at the same old things
                                I had seen every day, I now saw something I hadn't before, and identified them in
                                my mind. I heard sounds and knew what they meant without turning my head to look.
                                I felt the urge to go out exploring, but suddenly felt the need of sharing all this
                                new world with someone who would understand it. I thought of Herman, but he was
                                crippled and couldn't go with me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So I stayed home with Herman, I couldn't tell him about my dream, so I asked him,
                                "Herman, can't you tell me now why Father worries about what gets into me? Mother
                                is outside now. No one will hear us. The girls have gone too. What is Father worried
                                about? What does he think is going to happen to me?"</p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, he thinks something gets into you, Joey. And he doesn't know whether it's
                                a devil or an angel. Sometimes he's sure it's a devil, and that it'll lead you to
                                no good end. Remember how one time you would run off with his gun and go shooting
                                by the castle on the Rhine ; and next thing he knew you would be playing priest
                                with an old soap box for an altar, serving mass? One day you would be catching crabs
                                down by the pond, and spend hours looking at the worms you would break out of those
                                long stick-like things you found. And next day you would imitate Saint Joseph, and
                                say you wanted to be a carpenter."</p>
                            <p>
                                "Do I have to be the same all the time, Herman?"</p>
                            <p>
                                "Not for my part, Joey. That's what I like about you. One never knows what you are
                                going to say or do next."</p>
                            <p>
                                "Doesn't Father like that?"</p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, it isn't just that. It's when you say things about the future, or when you
                                seem so positive about something you couldn't possibly know. And when things happen
                                to you that are mysterious."

                            <p>
                                "But nothing mysterious happens to me, Herman."</p>
                            <p>
                                "Do you remember the time you had Uncle take you coasting on Montabaur hill? You
                                didn't have a sled, so you took a ladder instead. The hill was all ice, and at the
                                bottom was the crossroad. Uncle said a team of horses was coming, but it was too
                                late for him to stop you, and you could not stop yourself. He said there was nothing
                                on earth could keep you from being killed or badly hurt."
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                "That's just the thing, Joey. Ladder and all, you shot right through between the
                                legs of the horses, entirely unhurt. How did you do it? You didn't know. No one
                                knew. That was a mystery. And then when they asked you if you weren't frightened
                                when you saw the team ahead of you, you said no, you weren't, because the minute
                                you saw them you thought about something else and forgot all about them."</p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, I did, Herman, I closed my eyes, and saw the picture in the church."</p>
                            <p>
                                "Yes, I know, Joey. But you said you knew you weren't going to be hurt."</p>

                                "I did know it. I wasn't hurt."</p>

                                "Well, all right. I believe you. But I'm showing you what worries Father. When they
                                asked you how you knew you weren't going to be hurt bad or killed, you said it was
                                because you were going to marry a girl named Mary, with black eyes and dark hair
                                when you were twenty-seven years old, so that's how you knew you weren't going to
                                be killed before then."

                            <p>
                                "That's how I did know, Herman."</p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, that's what Father doesn't like. It's either nonsense, or you know. And if
                                you know, how do you know? He doesn't like it either way, Joey."</p>

                                So that night I lay there again in the dark feeling like a stranger, I tried to
                                remember how it all came about that I was there, and why I felt like I sometimes
                                did. It was the "feeling" that made me say things and think things like Herman said
                                Father didn't like, and Mother seemed to understand but hushed me up so he wouldn't
                                hear me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was six years old we were still in Montabaur, when there began to be talk in the
                                family about going to America. It was then that I began to be conscious of a world
                                beyond the village limits, I climbed to the top of the hill to try to see some of
                                it. I was alone, but I imagined that men were walking up the hill with me, and that
                                I was one of them.</p>
                            <p>
                                We all had on light, flexible suits of armor, like fish scales made of metal. There
                                was a bright red cross on each breast, a sword in one hand and a Bible in the other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was fifty years before I found out, inadvertently, that the village of Montabaur
                                and the hill I climbed that day were originally called Humbach; and that centuries
                                before me the Crusaders had climbed that hill and looked down over the beautiful
                                country, calling it "The Holy Land." The hill reminded them of that Mount that Christ
                                had ascended to pray, with Peter, James and John, where He was transfigured before
                                them. So they christened it Mount Tabor, and henceforth the little village at its
                                foot was called Montabaur.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I did not know this as I trudged along that day, surrounded by the creation of my
                                own imagination, a company of Christian warriors with swords and Bibles.</p>
                            <p>
                                When I reached the top I still could not see America. So I closed my eyes, but all
                                I could "see" was a lot of Indians. That was of course because of what I had heard
                                about America.</p>
                            <p class="center">

                            <p>
                                So far as I know now I had no knowledge of the Crusaders, or in any case of their
                                relation to the hill at Montabaur. Of course it is possible there was a foundation
                                for the "image play" with my remembering it. The fact is here unimportant as the
                                purpose of these early recollections is more to provide the background and to portray
                                the general nature of early thought elements as based on experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At present this is merely illustrative of a later problem: <em>What distinguishes a "true"
                                    imagination from a "false" one</em> as an element of imaginative experience when
                                it is regarded as an established fact that <em>we can think only with what we have acquired
                                    to think with? </em>In other words, all imaginative experience is made up of
                                combinations and recombinations of elements of sensory experience with a physiological
                                foundation. Nevertheless it has been established by experiment that the separate
                                parts or memory elements may be put together correctly or incorrectly to form a
                                true or false internal representation of external events or conditions. What distinguishes
                                between the "true" and the "false" when immediate verification by observation or
                                experiment is impossible?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The answer, later to be set forth more fully, is that the distinguishing characteristic
                                of a "true" imagination is a "feeling" that must be felt in order to understand
                                its nature.</p>
                            <p>
                                I did not at first comprehend this, but now in looking back at many thousands of
                                imaginative experiences of childhood and youth, I see that when the exercise of
                                the imagination is either unaccompanied by any feeling whatsoever, or when the imagination
                                produces a feeling as a result of its exercise (e.g. imagining Indians is followed
                                by a feeling of excitement and anticipation), the imagination is not to be trusted
                                unless a train of thought is followed back to determine its origin, and unless the
                                logic and reason are sufficiently matured and trained to adjust and retouch the
                                picture in accordance with experience, or reason based on observation and experiment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the other hand, if a certain type of "feeling" (which is a dominant experience
                                throughout this record) precedes the exercise of the imagination, and in fact produces
                                the imagination by selective stimulation and blending of memory elements to express,
                                to clothe, to embody, or to interpret the "feeling," we have then a type of spiritual
                                inspiration and mental phenomena that merits further investigation, to which an
                                introduction will be found in these pages.

                                My first experiences of a distinction in feeling associated with imagination were
                                largely unrealized at the time, but preserved in memory. In climbing Mount Tabor,
                                for example, the "feeling" came over me first that I was not alone. This caused
                                met to imagine myself surrounded with companions all starting out together for some
                                distant place to fight a battle. We would have swords but we would also have Bibles.
                                The Cross would be our armor inside, but outside we would need armor of steel.</p>
                            <p>
                                I did not then realize that these details characterized the Crusaders, who gave
                                the hill historic background and a name. All the elements were familiar to me, but
                                not the history. My memory contained swords, Bibles, Crosses, metal armor, and the
                                idea of men who would use these things. Emphatically, I did not see the "spirits"
                                of Crusaders walking up the hill with me. What I "saw" was entirely the product
                                of my own imagination in which was composited various elements of memory acquired
                                by previous sensory experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But these memory elements were selectively stimulated, assembled, and imbued with
                                life by a "feeling" at a particular time, under a particular condition, at a particular
                                place, which invested them with a meaning I did not myself comprehend until fifty
                                years later. <em>Whence and what the "feeling"?</em> Why the particular mental imagery
                                evoked by the feeling? Not in these few childhood cases alone, but in thousands
                                upon thousands of cases extending through a lifetime: my own and the lives of many
                                others whose experiences I have investigated.</p>
                            <p>
                                That was the quest in which, symbolically at least, I set forth with a sword in
                                one hand and a Bible in the other, to find the answer. I sought the truth, and as
                                time went on I found that my imagination provided the truth in one instance and
                                deceived me in another. It deceived me when I used my own reason and memory to speculate
                                on things I didn't know enough about. It deceived me when I concentrated or "tried."
                                It never deceived me when I didn't try, and didn't care, and had a "feeling" first
                                that started my imagination going to piece together in a flash what was aroused
                                from my memory by the feeling. <em>What was the feeling?</em>

                            <p>
                                I stress this because as time went on people who knew more about such things than
                                I would say, "The boy is psychic," or "He is clairvoyant." "It must be telepathy
                                or psychometry," and so on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And I knew they were all wrong. I possess no special, mystic, or occult sense that
                                other men do not possess. My mental operations are limited entirely to what I have
                                acquired and recorded by sensory experience. My imagination has only my own memory
                                to draw on. I visualize something spontaneously past, present or future, near or
                                far; it proves correct, with witnesses to verify it. My records contain thousands
                                of such witnessed cases in which I was correct 98% of the time. What did I "see"?
                                Nothing but a composite of my own memory elements of past experience.</p>
                            <p>
                                Truly and literally it was "nothing but my imagination." Still it corresponded with
                                the truth. <em>Why?</em> Was it a good guess? Was it "coincidence"? Was it "chance"?
                                These were questions to be answered by experimental research. At first I did not
                                know. But time ruled out chance beyond all dispute. And I did soon find out that
                                man's most important thinking does not take place in the brain alone, but with the
                                entire body and nervous system.
                            </p>

                                Truth is not to be found in man's memory of words or his reflective visual or oral
                                thinking. Words and memories of sights and sounds may be woven together into endless
                                combinations. <em>What gives them meaning?</em> What determines the exact word or
                                memory elements that will be combined in any given concept or idea or train of thought?
                                What assurances have we that our ideas have any correspondence with reality at all?</p>
                            <p>
                                Our only assurance from a scientific point of view is one based on experience, observation
                                and experiment. How then is it possible to know things in the future, at a distance
                                in the present and in the past, without opportunity for experience, observation,
                                or experiment? I can only say that I have established this fact for myself, that
                                I am writing this commentary on my early experience to introduce you to what I did
                                and how I did it, so you too may establish the facts for yourself, without taking
                                anyone's word for it; mine or that of anyone else.

                                It requires not the use of some mysterious faculty you do not possess, but rather
                                the suspension of the use of your "intellect"(verbal memory, reason, etc.) until
                                after your feeling of intuition has clothed itself imaginatively. Then harness it
                                by "logic and reason," by all means, if you can. But you must first learn how to
                                stop thinking at will. You must learn how to "deconcentrate " instead of concentrating.
                                You must make no strenuous "effort." You can't "force" it. You can't "play" with
                                it. You can't "practice" it. Spontaneity is its most essential characteristic. It
                                cannot manifest in the realm of habit or "conditioned reflexes," as in the case
                                of instinct.

                                In the language of the New Testament, you must not try to move the spirit; you must
                                let the spirit move you. This means that you must let the truth shape you, for the
                                simple reason that you cannot shape the truth. Your relation to truth is direct,
                                and not by reflective or verbal representation. You will find the truth neither
                                in words nor in memories, but only in direct nervous coordination of the whole of
                                your immediate sensory experience, internal as well as external.</p>

                                Just as the law of crystallization and chemical combination in the mineral kingdom
                                and the inorganic world, so also the law of selective absorption in the organic
                                world and vegetable kingdom, preserving the species, materializing the truth and
                                meaning of the seed. And so also the selective excitation and conditioning of reflexes
                                in the formation and operation of instinct in the animal kingdom. And there is evidence
                                that a similar law is at work in a more complicated system of self-conditioning
                                reflexes as manifest in the Vastly superior nervous organization of man: a mechanism
                                of adaptation not only to so-called seen or visible environments, but also to "unseen"
                                environments such as those manifest in radiant energy and the specifications of
                                future growth as manifest in seeds.</p>

                            <p>
                                All I knew as a child was that I had some sort of relation with what I could neither
                                see, hear, smell, taste nor touch; and that relation was a "feeling."</p>
                            <p>
                                But I found that "thinking" and "imagining" first created a false feeling that lied
                                to me. It was only when the feeling came first, without thinking, that the feeling
                                was right. And my thoughts and imaginations were right only if they were induced
                                by the feeling and not by association of thought resulting from what I saw or heard.
                                Sometimes there was nothing in my experience to fit the feelings that came to me.
                                Often I could not understand them at all in terms of word or ideas familiar to me.
                                Still I "knew"; but I couldn't explain it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I feel it necessary for the sake of the intellect of those who have had no such
                                experiences to explain thus at length the view from which my own are regarded. None
                                was regarded as occult or mystic in nature; none involved mysterious unknown senses,
                                nor were they "extra-sensory" or "super-sensory." Man's relation with his environments,
                                the universe, the rest of mankind, Deity, or forms of energy or life beyond his
                                present understanding is regarded as a physiological, neurological, sensory relation.
                                No responsive or imaginative activity is regarded as possible without a nervous
                                organization with a physiological foundation. And I have established to my own satisfaction
                                by experiment that if I apparently "see" a vision or dream, a dream that proves
                                to be prophetic, there is no so-called faculty of prevision, or second sight. The
                                "third eye" employed in such experiences is nothing more nor less than the "imagination"
                                that every man, woman, and child exercises to a greater or lesser degree. This "mind's
                                eye" of imagination has never, does not, cannot, and never will "see" anything outside
                                of one's own physiological organization. Its sensations are entirely "memory sensations."
                                It is strictly limited to the momentary and fragmentary revival of past experiences
                                as recorded in memory. Its one and essential power, which distinguishes the complicated
                                nervous organization of man from the more simple one of the animal, is the power
                                of recombination by means of which the imagination can make new creations out of
                                the memory elements of old experiences.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus we symbolize; we indulge in fantasy; we speculate and theorize; we create works
                                of art; we invent; and thus we produce a culture and a civilization. But as we thus
                                change environments, we change our "destiny," and we change the character of adaptation
                                that operates in the law of the survival of the fit. It becomes necessary to adapt
                                oneself to subtler and more complicated environments. It becomes necessary to develop
                                foresight, a knowledge of consequences; to plan, to prepare, to prevent. We find
                                that only those who do this survive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So now we have a law of the survival of the intuitively fit. But <em>intuition</em>
                                needs to be redefined, or we shall have to find a new word for it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Possibly there was a time when brute strength survived, but it soon became evident
                                that a less strong and more sensitive nervous organism better adapted itself to
                                environments in the survival of the instinctively fit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the appearance of man there was a new element; intelligence. Neither brute
                                strength nor instinct could cope with it. The intellect that could make a trap,
                                dig a pitfall for mastodons, and invent a gun soon became king of the earth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then what, as men fight each other as well as the elements of nature, to say
                                nothing of man's own creations, which break his bones and blast him from the face
                                of the earth? Do the strong battle and kill themselves off so that the meek shall
                                inherit the earth?</p>
                            <p>
                                Man now finds others than himself to battle. He builds cities, and the earth trembles,
                                opens great jaws and swallows them up. Volcanoes belch forth and bury them. Winds
                                blow and lay them low. The rain falls and great floods sweep all before them. Lightning
                                strikes and burns his structures to the ground. He builds ships and they sink at
                                sea. He makes fast-moving engines and dashes to destruction. He digs in the bowels
                                of the earth for its riches and is buried alive. The sun dries up his crops and
                                he perishes in famine. Pestilence breaks out and leaves a city of dead to be buried
                                unknown by the sands of ten thousand years, which he later digs up to decipher its
                                records. And ever and anon, as the beating pulse of an eternal war drum, he goes
                                to battle again, with ever increasing cunning in horrible devices with which to
                                slay - <em>himself</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is the last cycle; the final "survival." And is it the strong who survive? Is
                                it the cunning? Is it the meek? Is it the tyrant? Is it the selfish and arrogant?
                                It is not. It is they who feel the "feeling" and act on it. It is they who had a
                                "hunch" not to buy tickets on the ship that was going to sink. It is they who did
                                not build a city where Vesuvius would belch forth its lava and flames. It is they
                                who do not buy or build a house below the future flood-crest of a river. It is they
                                who packed their belongings and left the day before an earthquake shattered their
                                home. It is they who do these things without even thinking why.

                                <em>What is the "feeling"?</em> If we waited to use it until we knew what it was,
                                we would be like the farmer who still uses kerosene lamps because he doesn't intend
                                to use electricity until he knows what it is. The wren does not know why it flies
                                south; but it flies, and thus escapes cold and starvation. An animal obeys a "feeling"
                                directly, without translating it into words or thoughts of visual (imaginative)
                                representation. Man has so far lost his neural relation with reality (by having
                                substituted a world of words and symbolic representations) that he regards as abnormal
                                those who retain it or regain it. He invests it with an air of mystery, and represents
                                it by misleading words of special vocabularies, mystic, occult, theosophical, theological,
                                psychological, and psychic.

                                The mystery is no longer in the physiological and nervous organization of man -
                                not any more than in the construction of the Geiger counter. The mystery is in the
                                so-called cosmic rays that act on the Geiger counter. What are they, and where are
                                they from? The mystery is in the source of energy or life that acts on the nervous
                                organization of man to produce the "feeling." What is it, and where is it from?
                                There need be no other mystery. The organism upon which it acts is now fairly well
                                known. New ductless glands will be discovered. Many functions and operations will
                                be better understood. But in all its essentials the physiological foundation and
                                nervous organization is well enough understood, in the light of developments in
                                the field of electronics and radiant energy, to know that man is capable of experiencing
                                "feelings" (independent of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching) that emanate
                                from sources known or unknown. Heat is but an obvious example, as well as electrical
                                conditions of the atmosphere.
                            </p>

                                Beyond this coordinated sensitivity of the entire nervous system no further or special
                                sense is required. It is superfluous and absurd to postulate mysterious powers of
                                vision, clairaudience, "psychic abilities," and so on, when the normal powers and
                                modus operandi of imagination and memory not only suffice in explanation, but may
                                be investigated experimentally to establish the fact that one's so-called psychic
                                faculties are entirely limited constituently to the contents of the individual memory,
                                just as the constituents of words are limited to the alphabet employed, and my verbal
                                representation is limited to my vocabulary (i.e., my verbal memory), unless I pause
                                to look up or coin a word for an idea that has not yet been incorporated in my verbal
                                organization.</p>
                            <p>
                                And yet I have had words come to mind and pass over my tongue in experimental conditions,
                                words entirely unfamiliar to me, words in foreign languages, or technical terms
                                that could be found in a dictionary, and some that could not, containing information
                                that I did not myself knew, and that was verified as correct. I used familiar syllable,
                                however. I used the familiar alphabet. And even where I inscribed hieroglyphics
                                entirely unfamiliar to me, it was a composition of familiar smaller elements of
                                lines and curves, shapes and angles. The fact still described in terms so vastly
                                misleading and misunderstood as remains that my vision of these things cannot correctly
                                be "psychic," telepathic, and so on. It was nothing whatever but imagination compositing
                                familiar elements of previous sensory experience recorded in memory.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I see and correctly describe a scene ten thousand miles away. (I have done this
                                under experimental conditions as recorded in my files.) I see and describe a future
                                event, which occurs exactly as I described it, with only minor variations. What
                                is lacking or faulty in my description is lacking in my memory. For what so I see?
                                Nothing but my own imagination.</p>
                            <p>
                                Actually I do not see ten thousand miles away with any form of "vision" whatever.
                                I do not "see" the future. My reception or perception of these things is entirely
                                formless, entirely a "feeling," entirely devoid of image, word, thought or concept.
                                What makes it intelligible to myself or someone else is the activity of my imagination,
                                which endeavors to symbolize, portray or interpret the "feeling."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And what is the "feeling"? That is the one great mystery. That is the quest. That
                                is the source of all inspiration, the fountainhead of all spiritual gifts, the heart
                                and life of all religion. This is the foundation that science has provided for spiritual
                                understanding: a physiological foundation for a nervous organization that responds
                                to an unknown source or sources of energy in the form of "feelings." These feelings
                                are neurological and physiological; not the activity of a special or occult "sense,"
                                but the coordinated activity of the entire nervous organization. The reaction is
                                one of selective stimulation of previously experienced and conditioned reflex arcs
                                of memory. The imagination interprets the "feeling" in terms of memories associated
                                with similar feelings. Thus a complex feeling is broken down into its elements by
                                symbolic representation in an imaginative composite of memory elements. Thereby
                                we "understand" it.

                            <p>
                                With this explanation we may hope to contribute to a better understanding of mental
                                phenomena stripped of the deceiving terminology of generations of "psychic racketeering."
                                Man's "all-seeing eye" is his imagination, and his imagination sees not beyond his
                                own nerve ends. It sees only the "past" that has been recorded in memory. Still,
                                by this means he may portray what has not yet been recorded (i.e., the future);
                                he may "see" around the world; and he may explore the past before his birth in the
                                history of the human race. And why? Because his quivering nerves are open to the
                                universe and susceptible to innumerable feelings. The feelings stimulate and thus
                                clothe themselves in reawakened memory sensations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus we do not see the past, present or future beyond the range of our senses, but
                                we "imagine" it. And if our "feeling" is genuine, our imagination is "true."</p>
                            <p>
                                Can there be a "false feeling"? Yes, when it is merely the echo of a past feeling
                                aroused by suggestion, association of thought, and memory of words: i.e., intellectual
                                activity in general. The "feeling from outside" can bring you information of a phenomenal
                                nature only when you are able to suspend all internal activity of thought. The "feeling"
                                must have an empty slate to write on. It must be allowed to select your memories,
                                to shape them in your imagination, to choose its own words. The result will be instantaneous;
                                and until you understand the language of feeling, you may not be able to distinguish
                                such formations from your own thoughts. Or, on the other hand, the experience may
                                be so pronounced that you will think you see a "vision," a "spirit" or a "ghost."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You may feel indignant if others call it a hallucination or "imagination," but that
                                is exactly what it is, nothing more. Still, it may be a genuine experience and the
                                "vision" may be true in every detail within the capacity of your memory to provide
                                the necessary elements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To help you understand how this can be, and to help you to distinguish between false
                                and true, the wrong and right use of the imagination, the false echo from the genuine
                                feeling, I have taken these pains both to record and to comment on my own personal
                                adventures and research along these lines.</p>
                            <p class="center">

                            <p>
                                Not everything is easy to explain, but we must avoid attaching the "mystery" to
                                the wrong place. Within all seeds is the "design" of what they will become by growth
                                and development. The creative power exists in the unrecorded. What has been recorded
                                is already "dead." Thus the creative and progressive power in man necessarily manifests
                                as a prophetic power, active in determining what he shall be, and not what he has
                                been.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What has been inherited or already determined as a conditioned reflex is of the
                                past. But what selects or chooses, as in the power of selective absorption of a
                                seed, or the power of selective stimulation in physiological man, is of the "future"
                                in function of "time," which exists solely as a biological phenomenon of succession
                                in growth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus there are innumerable sources of prophetic "feeling" in man that need not be
                                the occasion of any "mystery." In our very careless and inadequate verbal organization
                                we speak of <em>wishes, wants, desires, appetites, hunger; of ambition, aspiration, ideals;
                                    hope, anticipation, expectations, faith</em>, and so on. These terms are neither
                                clearly understood, defined nor differentiated; and means have not been provided
                                to distinguish between those sources of prophetic feeling that are inherent to the
                                structure of our physiological organization, as in the case of animals whose cycle
                                of progressive activity repeats itself each generation, and those sources of prophetic
                                feeling that are not inherent to the individual physiological structure but which
                                manifest in human progress, which repeats itself in cycles extending through several
                                generations.</p>
                            <p>
                                To the latter we must attach the "mystery." Self-preservation is not a remarkable
                                phenomenon, but race-preservation is. The man who will fight to preserve himself
                                or his family is not a particularly interesting object of study, but the man who
                                will live his life and give his life for the sake of mankind and human progress
                                is manifesting the mystery that is the religion of mankind. <em>What is the source of
                                    his "feelings"? </em>

                                But to return to my own experiences, I have found that whereas "memory is not inherited
                                (i.e., it is not possible to "remember" before we were born in terms of our ability
                                to recall our own sensory experience since birth), we do nevertheless inherit enough
                                of our parents, and through them of past ancestors, to manifest a "feeling" that
                                is capable of arousing parallel memories in our own experience. And thus our imagination
                                may approximate some condition or memory of a parent or ancestor before our birth.</p>
                            <p>
                                I make this statement on the basis of considerable evidence. Often, however, there
                                is a composite of elements derived from both father and mother, so that the feeling
                                is complex and the resulting imagination a mixture.

                                Just what caused my mother to dream prophetic dreams while bearing me, and not any
                                of the other children, is something that I do not even attempt to explain. What
                                caused me to dream at the age of seven, going on eight, on a night when I was "reborn"
                                by a distinct psychological change, a dream similar to one my mother dreamed the
                                night I was born one month too soon - that again is something I cannot explain at
                                this stage of the record. And why we both should have dreamed that Herman was hanging
                                on the wall, nailed there as if he had been crucified, might possibly be considered
                                a coincidence, in view of the fact that the symbolism is not unusual in a Catholic
                                family; and if we consider crucifixion to be a symbol of suffering, it could certainly
                                apply to poor Herman, a cripple from birth.</p>
                            <p>
                                Nevertheless I can swear that under the circumstances neither Mother nor I breathed
                                a word to Herman about that dream; nor did we tell anyone else, on account of Father's
                                attitude toward such things.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We could not regard the dream as prophetic in a literal sense, since it would be
                                absurd to think that Herman would ever really be found hanging on the wall. At most
                                we could regard it as symbolic, and at worst as symbolic of death. But the dream
                                of a series that had not come true, and it had upset her so much at the time that
                                I was precipitated into the world in a premature birth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Therefore our feelings can be imagined when Herman called Mother one day, after
                                a spell of suffering, and said, "<em>Mother, hang me on the wall here!</em>"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shocked, and thinking he was perhaps delirious, she asked, "And why should I do
                                that?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He answered, "Because I want to die like Christ died."</p>
                            <p>
                                Mother said, "But you are not going to die, Herman! Don't talk that way."</p>
                            <p>
                                He answered, "Yes, I am, Mother."</p>
                            <p>
                                She put her arm about him, and they prayed together. Then Herman cried himself to
                                sleep.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He never woke up again.
