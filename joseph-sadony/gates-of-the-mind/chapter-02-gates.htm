								So Herman died just when I felt that I needed him most. Now I was the only boy;
								I had no brother; and I was indeed alone in the world. For my father was working
								all day at the large paper mill; my mother was kept busy; the girls had their own
								interests. I was sent to a Catholic school, but outside of school had to shift for
								myself.
							</p>
							<p>
								And now I made some discoveries; first, that Herman was not "dead."</p>
							<p>
								How did I know? I could not see him, nor could I hear his voice. But I very definitely
								"felt" his presence. And then, of course, I could imagine him by remembering him
								and in my imagination I could carry on a conversation with him.</p>
							<p>
								Was this really Herman or only my imagination? Well, in the first place, what is
								the difference between the first sense impression, and the recalling of that sense
								impression as a memory?</p>
							<p>
								When the reflection of light from Herman that affected my optic nerves affected
								instead the silver emulsion of a photographic film, we look at the result and say,
								<em>"That's Herman."</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								I recall the image of Herman in my memory and say to myself, "<em>It's Herman</em>."
							</p>
							<p>
								Certainly I know that it is only my memory, and only in my imagination. But then
								I think, "Well, anyway, Herman is still alive in my mind."</p>
							<p>
								It was that way when Herman was still alive; when I was off somewhere and he was
								home. I could remember him then too. But now this was different, because there was
								a "feeling." And somehow Herman, or the thought of Herman, seemed to be able to
								put a life into my memory and make me imagine things I never imagined before, all
								through that feeling.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first time I felt it was a few days after Herman was buried. The feeling came
								first, and then I thought of Herman.</p>
							<p>
								I imagined him saying, "Well, Joey, I'm still here in your memory, anyway."</p>
							<p>
								I thought, "Now you won't have to stay home all the time, Herman. You can play with
								me"
							</p>
							<p>
								And then in my imagination, my memory of Herman said, "<em>Then don't remember me this
									way, Joey! I'm not crippled any more.</em>"
							</p>
							<p>
								It was then that I realized I was remembering Herman just as he had been when I
								saw him last. So I changed everything except his face and his eyes and my memory
								of his voice. Limb by limb I took my memory of Herman and made it over in my imagination,
								until it could run around as I did.
							</p>
							<p>
								And then I was so thrilled by the difference that tears came to my eyes. The feeling
								became so strong that it burst out of my mouth, and I said, "<em>Thanks!</em>"</p>
							<p>
								Then something struck me funny, and I said, "Herman, was that me thanking you, or
								you thanking me?"</p>
							<p>
								Suddenly a joyous feeling filled me, and I laughed with it.
							</p>
							<p>
								I ran out to play and imagined Herman running out with me. I began to show him all
								the things he hadn't been able to see or do when he was crippled.</p>
							<p>
								It did not occur to me to regard it as anything other than pure imagination on my
								part. I did not think Herman's "spirit" was running around with me. I had always
								carried on conversations in my mind; and now for a while, instead of talking with
								myself, I talked with a reconstructed memory of Herman in my imagination. The fact
								that my imaginary and reconstructed brother occasionally said things in my imagination
								that I did not knowingly put into his mouth was a fact that passed unnoticed by
								me at the time. I took it for granted as something quite to be expected.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, I would go to the woods, and I would imagine Herman saying, "<em>Well, Joey,
									we haven't seen any Indians yet</em>."</p>
							<p>
								And this would remind me that my chief anticipation on leaving Montabaur for the
								New World was the prospect of Indians. There was first a long coach ride. It was
								right, and I was the only one of all the passengers who stayed awake. I imagined
								Indians stopping the horses and saying that they would kill me if I made a sound
								or woke the rest up.</p>
							<p>
								I thought, "But you were asleep, Herman."</p>
							<p>
								And my imagination of Herman answered, "<em>Not when you were scalped, Joey. That woke
									me up." </em>
							</p>
							<p>
								And then I laughed, because I had forgotten that incident; but now I remembered
								that right while I was in the thick of my imaginary Indians during the coach ride,
								someone in the coach dropped something that hit me on the head. So vivid were my
								imaginings that for a moment I thought I had been scalped, and woke Herman up with
								my war-whoop.

							</p>
							<p>
								School made me nervous, sitting so still. One day I began to beat a rhythm with
								my hands and feet. The teacher told me to stop, and asked me what I was doing it
								for. I couldn't answer her.
							</p>
							<p>
								She said, "Well, if you can do a thing, you can explain why you were doing it. Now
								tell me!"</p>
							<p>
								All I could say was, "I don't know."</p>
							<p>
								So she struck me over the knuckles with a ruler, and said, "Well, don't do it again,
								or this ruler will know a better place to hit you."</p>
							<p>
								I sat there stunned and humiliated, with tears blinding my eyes. It was not just
								the pain on the knuckles. It was worse than that. I had not been long in the school,
								and I had looked up with admiration at the teacher. I had wanted her to like me,
								and now she had struck me.</p>
							<p>
								Needing some comfort, I imagined Herman, and said in my mind, "Was that right, Herman?
								Was it right for her to hit me that way?"
							</p>
							<p>
								I imagined Herman saying, "<em>Why didn't you tell her, Joey? Tell her why you were doing
									that. Go after school and tell her</em>."</p>
							<p>
								"But I don't know why."</p>
							<p>
								"<em>Yes you do</em>."
							</p>
							<p>
								And then it came to me. On the way to America we could not afford a first class
								passage, so we were near the engine of the ship during the entire trip. For seventeen
								days the rhythmic beat of the engine pounded its way into my system, so that whenever
								I became nervous or restless my feet or fingers unconsciously tapped out the rhythm
								of the monotonous chugging of the ship's engine.</p>
							<p>
								Then I imagined Herman saying, "<em>Do you remember how you tied a tin can to a string
									and let it down over the side of the ship, Joey?"</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								Then I thought, "Yes, I would draw it up full of water sometimes. But one day the
								water in the can was warm. And then it was cold again. I wonder why that was?"</p>
							<p>
								The answer came, "<em>Ask her. Ask the teacher when you explain about beating your hands
									and feet.</em>"</p>
							<p>
								And so I did. She was interested, and talked about it with someone else. Then she
								told me that when the water I drew up was warm, we were crossing the Gulf Stream
								. She said she was sorry she had struck my knuckles with the ruler, and would not
								have done so if I had explained to her; but I wouldn't answer her, and that's why
								she struck me.
							</p>
							<p class="center">

							</p>
							<p>
								As time passed I took more and more to wandering through the woods, studying all
								living things in my own way, speaking to them and making believe that they answered
								me.
							</p>
							<p>
								I thought, "<em>Everything could speak if we could only interpret it</em>."</p>
							<p>
								By this even as a child, I did not believe that animals and trees could speak the
								English or any other language of spoken words, or that they had human qualities.
								(That would have been anthropomorphic!) But I did believe that everything in nature
								had a "meaning," like a word in the language of Nature; and that this language that
								we see through our eyes, hear through our ears, smell through our nose, touch with
								our fingers, and taste with our tongues, was also the language that was in my head
								when I closed my eyes and ears, and "imagined" things.
							</p>
							<p>
								This was a language "without words," and this, I thought, was the one language of
								all the world, the language of thought itself, in which all knowledge could be expressed.
								I was forced to this language for my own understanding, moving from a country where
								one language was spoken to a country where another language was spoken.</p>
							<p>
								So I looked at a tree and understood it. I heard a sound and knew what made it without
								looking to see. I smelled odors in the woods, and knew what they came from. And
								then I found that if I touched something with my fingers, I could tell whether anyone
								else had touched it before me.
							</p>
							<p>
								How did I know? It was a "feeling." And then I found that if I let that feeling
								make me "imagine" things without thinking, I could describe who had touched, it,
								and other things connected with it in the past. As time passed, someone told me,
								"<em>What, that's psychometry </em>. You were able to psychometrize things."</p>
							<p>
								I answered, "But that's silly. It isn't anything but what I feel with my fingers.
								And then I try to imagine what the feeling means."</p>
							<p>
								And then they would say, "But you described the whole scene exactly, where this
								object came from. You must see it in order to do that."</p>
							<p>
								But I didn't see it. I saw nothing but my own imagination; nothing but bits and
								fragments of my own past memories. But what put them together correctly to express
								the meaning of a "feeling"?</p>
							<p>
								What puts the letters of the alphabet together to form words? What puts words together
								to form sentences of understanding?
							</p>
							<p>
								No one could answer me. Nor could I. All I knew was that if I stroked a thing with
								my fingers until I felt that it was a part of me, like my foot, I could "feel" it,
								just like my foot.</p>
							<p>
								There is only one way my foot can talk to me, and that is by a feeling. It may be
								pleasant or unpleasant, hot or cold; comfortable, tired or painful. My own memory
								tells me why, and what it means. I can't see my foot; it's in my shoe. I can't see
								my foot even if it's bare. All I can see is the dead skin outside. That's all I
								can see of anything. All we ever see is the dead skin of things. We never see what
								anything really is. We can only "feel" it.</p>
							<p>
								If people were going to insist on calling that "seeing," very well then. I could
								"see" better with the ends of my fingers and with my eyes closed. Also I could "hear"
								better that way.</p>
							<p>
								To prove it, and to amuse my friends, I would hold my hand high, fingertips in the
								direction of a distant railway engine five miles away that none of my friends could
								hear or see. I would say, "It's whistling, only you can't hear it now." Then, "It's
								coming closer, closer - <em>now it's going to whistle</em>: one, two, three - " and
								<em>whooo</em> came the shriek of the engine just after my third count.
							</p>
							<p>
								"But how did you know?"</p>
							<p>
								"I saw the engineer reach up to pull the whistle."
							</p>
							<p>
								"But how did you see it? We couldn't even see the train yet."</p>
							<p>
								"With my fingers."</p>
							<p>
								"But you can't see with your fingers!"</p>
							<p>
								"Of course not. But that's what you insist on calling it."</p>
							<p>
								"But you must see it in your mind, then. It's second sight. It's clairvoyance."</p>
							<p>
								"Those are just words. And what they mean to you isn't true. I don't see that train
								and that engineer at all. I'm just imagining it. What I see in my mind is a train
								I remember looking at one time from close up. The engineer in my mind is one who
								waved at me one time. That may be him, but I don't think so, and I don't know. It's
								the engineer in my memory and not the engineer in the train that starts reaching
								for the handle to pull the whistle. When he starts reaching, I start counting. That's
								all there is to it."</p>
							<p>
								"But what makes the engineer in your imagination start reaching at the right time?"</p>
							<p>
								"I don't know."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Well, I don't understand it at all. You're a strange one, and no fooling."</p>
							<p>
								I didn't like this. I would say, "You could do it too, but you don't try."</p>
							<p>
								One time I said, "I'll show you. Let me put your coat over your head. Hold up your
								hand. A cloud is going to pass over the sun. You tell me the minute it does. Then
								after a few minutes tell me when the sun breaks through again."</p>
							<p>
								When this was done successfully, I asked, "How did you know?"</p>
							<p>
								"Because I could feel the warmth of the sun on my skin. When it was cool I knew
								the cloud had covered the sun. When it was warm again I knew the cloud had passed."</p>
							<p>
								"Well what's strange about that? It was a feeling in your hand and you knew what
								it meant."</p>
							<p>
								"But that's different."</p>
							<p>
								"No, it isn't different. Not in the way you mean. Of course it's different, but
								it's the same thing."</p>
							<p>
								"What a way to talk! It's the same thing only different! That's about as clear as
								mud, Joey."</p>
							<p>
								So I stopped trying to explain things for a while. I didn't know enough about them
								myself.</p>
							<p class="center">
								* * * * *
							</p>
							<p class="totop">
								<a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">top of page</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								In school, things didn't go so well. Not that it was hard for me, or that I got
								poor marks. But they didn't teach the things I wanted to know about, and they didn't
								talk the language I understood best.
							</p>
							<p>
								What I wanted I couldn't express or explain at that time. My soul cried out dumbly
								what others before me and after me found words to say: "<em>Give me the things, not words
									about things. Give me the thoughts, not words about thoughts</em>."</p>
							<p>
								So I could not bring myself to study then; and in a whole lifetime of research I
								have never been able to study since; to study things and nature, yes; but not words
								and books.</p>
							<p>
								Thirty years later I dreamed a dream of being a schoolboy again, kneeling on a dusty
								corner asleep, while the other pupils worked their heads off studying the essential
								oils. When recess came, I went out and had a fine time, but the rest were too tired.</p>
							<p>
								This was symbolic of my whole life. I have seen more lives blasted and stunted by
								brain-cramming than by utter ignorance. Hence I have always preached against tiring
								out the colt in practice before the hour set for the race.</p>
							<p>
								Man's worst enemy is his memory, he has misused it. It was never meant to be a trunk
								into which to pack a lot of words and opinions. It was meant to record experience
								as a sample-case, an alphabet of nature's language, like stringing a harp or piano,
								one string of each tone. Then any melody in the world of music can be played on
								it. And even from a distance the vibration of another tone will produce a vibration
								in my instrument, if I possess a string of like pitch to respond to it. I do not
								need to see, hear, smell, taste or touch it. The string in my piano is going to
								vibrate if someone strikes the same string on another piano at a distance.
							</p>
							<p>
								But the string of my piano is not going to vibrate if I use the piano as a trunk
								and pack it full of words. The words are going to bang around on the strings so
								I cannot hear anything else.</p>
							<p>
								As long as I didn't learn from books; as long as I kept my memory from recording
								anything but direct experience, experiment and observation; and as long as I could
								seal off a part of my brain for a vocabulary, but refrain from using it in my thinking,
								then my thinking was not confined to my head. I could think with my whole body,
								with every nerve and organ: then I would know the truth, for they would not lie
								to me as men did, and as books did, using words.</p>
							<p>
								I wanted the truth to select its own words, and not for men to try to shape ideas
								of truth in my brain with their words. This would not be true, and it was impossible
								ever for it to be true; for that is not what truth is.
							</p>
							<p>
								Every argument that I ever heard was caused by someone trying to shape the truth
								by words, instead of allowing the words to be shaped by truth.</p>
							<p>
								Fervently and deeply I wanted the truth, and I could see that none of the teachers
								knew the truth; none of the books told the truth. It was nothing but words, and
								words about words. Brick by brick, word by word, I saw the wall being built around
								us children to seal us for life into one room of our brain, with only two windows,
								our eyes, safely guarded with prison bars of words stronger than steel that also
								kept out most of the light; with every other gate of the mind carefully sealed by
								a word, so that no feeling could be arrived at, save through a word first, like
								putting gloves on our hands, shoes on our feet, spectacles on our eyes, muffs on
								our ears, and a woolen padding on every nerve end so we would be cut off from the
								quivering, life-giving pulsations of direct contact with the truth.</p>
							<p class="center">
								* * * * *
							</p>
							<p class="totop">
								<a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">top of page</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								So I revolted; tore down the wall of words; threw off my shoes, both physically
								and mentally, and walked barefoot even where the stones were sharp and painful.</p>
							<p>
								I went on alone in rain and thunderstorms, praying to God to let me feel the truth
								that no one could tell me in words. I promised that if He could make me "feel" the
								right things to do, I would always obey those feelings, instead of what other people
								told me to do when one person said one thing, and another said another.
							</p>
							<p>
								When I got out alone like this, a strange feeling would sometimes come over me.
								When it did, then as far as I could see, everything, instead of being outside my
								head, seemed to be inside my head.
							</p>
							<p>
								Looking out over a marsh where the frogs were croaking, I would hear them as if
								they were inside my head. They seemed to be a part of me, and I would amuse myself
								by pointing in a certain direction, saying, "<em>One, two, three - now</em>!" - and
								a big bullfrog would croak from where I pointed.
							</p>
							<p>
								So far as the evidence of personal experience is concerned, it does not answer the
								question whether the seeming ability to "cause" a frog to croak at will was a real
								one, or whether I predicted the croak.</p>
							<p>
								This is merely illustrative. The problem comes up repeatedly in my records, as this
								type of phenomena is now an established fact with a sufficient number of reliable
								witnesses, so that the solution to this problem is one of the most fundamental considerations
								in the fields of science, philosophy, and religion. To what extent does the mind
								"make" things happen, and to what extent does the mind foresee what is going to
								happen? Does the mind create thought, or is it acted upon by thought?
							</p>
							<p>
								Has man deceived himself by extending his conception of biological time beyond the
								sphere of its function in nature? Does cause precede or follow effect? Have we perhaps
								gotten the cart before the horse in thinking that the cause comes first because
								of our manner of recording biological time in a reflective function of memory, where
								things are naturally reversed as in a mirror or any other phenomenon of reflection?
								How is it, for example, that in dreams the sound that caused a dream wakes you up,
								and that the dream precedes the sound that has "caused" it?</p>
							<p class="center">
								* * * * *
							</p>
							<p class="totop">
								<a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">top of page</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Then again, here is an acorn. Overhead I see the oak tree from which it fell. I
								know that if I plant it, it will grow into another oak tree; and if I gather all
								the acorns from that, I can prove that within my hand at this moment I hold the
								means to produce a whole forest of oak trees.
							</p>
							<p>
								The past is "outside," over my head; the acorn has left it forever. Yet in the same
								moment I imagine the future forest of oak trees; and I know that at this very minute,
								though the chemical constituents of that oak tree of the future are in the air I
								breathe, and in the soil beneath my feet, I know that the true cause of that future
								forest lies in the palm of my hand, inside the seed (in the future of that growth),
								and not in the tree overhead, (its past), from which it has departed forever.</p>
							<p>
								The cause of a thing is in action or a function, and not a position or sequence
								in space or in biological time. The old oak tree produced the acorn in my hand,
								but now the active cause of the future oak tree is in that acorn as its own future,
								which becomes manifest by selective absorption in growth. The old oak tree is cut
								off from any possible function as a cause of growth in the new tree. The power of
								creation is the future biologically. The past is the memory of the body, the future
								is the memory of the seed. My dream precedes the sound that causes it, just as my
								backward is forward in the mirror, for a dream is a reflex of memory.
							</p>
							<p>
								And likewise when by shock of emergency or will of intent and earnest desire we
								suspend our logic and reason, and revolt from our walls of words, then only our
								raw nerves are exposed to nature; we think with our spine, our hands, our feet,
								our skin. What is outside of us is now part of us, inside. We are a waking dream;
								we are conscious on the other side of the fence; our actions precede what causes
								them.
							</p>
							<p>
								I say, <em>"One, two, three - "</em> and the train whistles. I say, <em>"One, two, three
									- "</em> and a frog croaks. And one time, before eleven witnesses who are all
								still living as I write this (this was later in life), I said, in the midst of a
								storm. "Look at that tree, if you want to see something. Suppose I told you that
								I could make the lightning strike that tree; would you believe me? Of course not.
								But watch it. <em>One, two, three - ".</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								And no one was more astonished than I when a bolt of lightning split the tree before
								our eyes; for I was in a "waking dream" at the time, having abandoned myself to
								the spirit and enjoyment of the storm. The lightning bolt broke my state of contemplation,
								or whatever you may choose to call it; hence I was astonished at the fulfillment
								of what I had been only half conscious of saying.

								This may sound incredible, but I assure you that it is a fact of experience before
								witnesses, and only one of several thousand cases embodying the same principle.
								None of my witnesses is of a type to grant me power to cause a particular tree to
								be split by lightning at the third count of my finger. There are, therefore, only
								a few other possible conclusions:</p>
							<p>
								1. That as in a dream, my speech preceded the sound or event that caused it; in
								which case, our conception of and relation to "time" needs deeper investigation
								and perhaps drastic revision.</p>
							<p>
								2. That neither my speech nor the event was the cause of the other, both being the
								effect of a common cause; viz. the power that caused the event also called my attention
								to it, and through me the attention of others before it happened.</p>
							<p>
								Either 1 or 2 with variations could be embodied in a theory of prophecy or prevision.
								We could state another possibility:</p>
							<p>
								3. That the cause of my speech was not the power that caused the event, but rather
								a power in myself, or acting upon myself, which could foresee the event without
								any causal connection whatever.</p>
							<p>
								Still further, 2 might be clarified by limiting the "power" to a purely material
								nature. For example, we say that "instinct" causes muskrats to "hole in" just before
								a storm; but reflex conditioned by a change or degree of atmospheric pressure associated
								with a consequence would account for it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Moreover, I have turned one of my laboratories into a large electrical condenser,
								with an electronic ohmmeter connected between a metallic roof and the ground. The
								radiation resistance of this portion of space started building up one rainy day;
								and as the needle mounted higher and higher, till it could record no more, at one
								hundred million ohms, I knew without any "mental phenomena" that lightning was going
								to strike in the vicinity. It struck within two minutes after the capacity of the
								meter had been reached. Who is to say that the human nervous organization is not
								as sensitive as one built by man's hands?</p>
							<p>
								Still, that would not account for picking the right tree. Nor did the meter tell
								me what my nerves now did after the crash, when I asked, <em>"Did anyone get the horses
									in before it started to rain?" </em>
							</p>
							<p>
								My assistant said, "I don't know. Why? Shall I go and find out?"
							</p>
							<p>
								I said, "The bolt was so close it made me feel as if I were a horse. I imagined
								a horse leaping into the air and falling down dead."</p>
							<p>
								My assistant went back to the barn and found that the horses were not in, as the
								rain had come on so suddenly. One of the other men was standing in the barn looking
								out at the downpour that followed the crash.
							</p>
							<p>
								He said, "Yes, I know the horses should have been brought in, but I was just starting
								back to the pasture for them when it started. I'm just waiting for it to let up
								a little"</p>
							<p>
								So both went back to look for the horses, and found two of them dead. One of them
								had leaped a six-foot fence and was several feet away without any tracks leading
								there.</p>
							<p>
								In this case and others like it, I have had delicate instruments in my laboratory,
								in a temperature-controlled room, which correlated in their functions with outdoor
								temperature and weather changes, but slightly in advance of the outdoor effects.
								It became evident that the instruments were being acted upon at once by forces that
								a little later, sometimes five to twenty minutes, brought about the outdoor changes;
								thus enabling us to predict them by a small margin. Changes in atmospheric and electrical
								conditions, for example, preceded local meteorological effects, as also atmospheric
								tidal effects on temperature changes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thus it seems reasonable to believe that the human nervous system might be able
								to detect conditions on the same basis. But this will not account for all the phenomena
								observed. The imminence of a lightning bolt might be felt, but what explains pointing
								to the tree it will strike, and timing the flash to the second? What explains the
								fact that when a real horse leaped into the air and dropped dead, a memory of a
								horse in my imagination did likewise?</p>
							<p>
								And if what causes a frog to croak can act more quickly upon my nervous system when
								"attuned" to it, giving me time to count three before the frog reacts, how does
								this work with the engineer tooting his whistle, or a man doing what I say he is
								going to do without his knowledge of the fact, so that the power of direct suggestion
								is eliminated? Did I make him do it; did I foresee that he was going to do it; or
								were we both acted upon by some unknown third factor that caused me to predict the
								act, and the other man to fulfill it?
							</p>
							<p>
								All that is established experimentally (and this I have done thousands of times
								in the course of my research) is a relation of sequence with respect to the biological
								time of me and my witnesses. (1) I state what is going to happen. (2) It happens.
								Is 1 the cause of 2? Is 2 the cause of 1? Are both 1 and 2 the effect of a common
								cause? Is the relation entirely fortuitous, i.e., just a matter of "chance" or "coincidence"?
								Or is there some other explanation?
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, is it possible that our conception of causality is in error, and that
								prevision does not imply predestination; that prophecy and "free will" are perfectly
								compatible if not identical, in the sense that free will requires dimension in biological
								time?</p>
							<p>
								If free will on the part of Deity or man requires the setting in motion of processes
								that require or constitute time, the determination and the fulfillment of free will
								will be separated by a time interval that may vary from an instant in which you
								ask your neighbor at the table to pass the butter, up to a lifetime that may be
								cut short if it is your "free will" to end it, or to violate the laws of health
								in slow suicide of neglect.</p>
							<p>
								In any case the aim of the bullet can be altered up to the moment the trigger is
								pulled; but once pulled, the bullet is on its way to a target that was not predestined
								until the release of nature's forces beyond man's control.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since in every case free will does involve a time interval, however short or long,
								between its determination and its fulfillment, it is perfectly possible that prophecy
								is based on immediate knowledge or foreknowledge of the execution of free will in
								a determination that thus permits the manifestation of prophecy in perfect harmony
								with free will. Yet this has been considered in philosophic and theological difficulty
								of insurmountable nature, whereas it is in nature and human experience no difficulty
								at all.
							</p>
							<p>
								The only difference between scientific and intuitive prediction is that in science
								the execution of an act of free will is known by observation or intention, and that
								in the case of intuition it is "sensed" or "felt" in a way no more "occult" or mysterious
								than the function of an insect's antennae, but in man by the coordinated activity
								and sensitivity of his entire nervous organization. And whereas science is based
								on reflective analysis and comparison of sensory perceptions and memories of past
								sensory perceptions, intuition is based on the automatic and synthetic coordination
								of man's entire physiological organization, wherein by selective stimulation of
								reflex arcs (called "memory") a series of "feelings" is transformed into an activity
								of imagination that constitutes understanding and provides a basis for responsive
								activity of the motor or sympathetic nervous system.</p>
							<p>
								If thoughts may be changed, environments may be changed. If environments may be
								changed, destiny may be changed, for there is a constant adaptation to environments.
								So "destiny" may be altered by one who knows the laws by which he can do so intelligently.
								This knowledge constitutes "free will" and involves "moral responsibility." Not
								everyone acquires or exercises it, hence the present condition of the world today.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most of us do what we do today because of the momentum of yesterday, or by reaction
								to stimuli, without exercising the ability to resist or suppress that reaction.
								Thus we are governed by past and present (i.e., memory and sensory reaction), which
								perpetuates vicious circles, retards progress, and prolongs undesirable conditions;
								whereas the exercise of "free will" consists of and entirely depends upon a consideration
								of and preparation for "tomorrow."
							</p>
							<p>
								The present moment is too late to exercise this prerogative with any expectation
								of altering the present moment. We can alter our future in cooperation with nature's
								laws, by considering between two possible courses of action, and choosing not merely
								the course of action leading to the "most desirable" result, but the criterion by
								which we shall evaluate that "desirability."</p>
							<p>
								The mistake many make is in considering the "will" and "desire" as simple things.
								They are not simple but complex. It is possible to change the will by "willing to
								will," and to change a desire by "desiring to desire" (i.e., by changing one's criterion).
							</p>
							<p>
								Man has two sources of desire and will that are founded in two distinct physiological
								systems of conditioned reflexes. One of these he shares in common with all animals;
								the other is distinctly the endowment and distinguishing characteristics of man.
								Neither of these two systems is "free" insofar as the reflexes have already been
								formed and conditioned. The freedom that is denied to animals and enjoyed by man
								is the power and the necessity by reflection to create and modify the growth and
								development of further reflex arcs (i.e., to make or modify tendencies, habits or
								hopes).</p>
							<p>
								If we call this reflective and representative ability "intellect," then this is
								the seat and source and <em>modus operandi</em> of individuality and free will. For
								the intellect may lend its aid as a modifier to either one of man's two sources
								of will; or man's two sources of will may engage in conflict for the possession
								of the intellect. The one is the will of experience, habit, instinct; the other
								of the selective development of latent possibilities in the seed. One is the voice
								of the past; the other of the future. Free will is the gift of prophecy; and the
								gift of prophecy is free will.
							</p>
							<p>
								The moment you lose hope and faith, your destiny is established regardless of your
								will, like a bullet shot from a rifle that cannot be turned from its course. As
								long as your optimistic hand holds opportunity, you govern "fate"; but if you drop
								it through doubt, carelessness or pessimism, you are in the hand of fate's "destiny,"
								not your own will.</p>
							<p>
								Thus religion, as the guarantor of hope and the guardian of faith, is our only organized
								insurance of freedom and free will. A wholly dogmatic and authoritarian religion,
								however, is a religion in name only, a speculative system of beliefs, not an operative
								and phenomenal function of faith.

							</p>
							<p>
								Free will is the power. What man believes to be his "will" is but a dam for the
								capture and use of this power. All is right until he uses his willpower the wrong
								way.</p>
							<p>
								This is the power of the individual, of governing the polarity of his desires by
								commanding the animal propensities or the spiritual sentiments. Thus he determines
								which shall predominate, according to whether he allows himself to respond to instinct
								(past), or to be influenced by intuition or inspiration (future).</p>
							<p>
								Man's only escape from this fundamental conflict of choice has been a disastrous
								one for him (i.e., to reject both instinct and intuition), thus confining himself
								to the independent operations of the intellect (i.e., to a world of reflective and
								verbal representations).
							</p>
							<p>
								Within this sphere of purely intellectual activity, the truth is entirely irrelevant
								with respect to the physiological and psychological consequences of the reflective
								and representative activities of the brain and nervous system. For the multifarious
								combinations of memory sensations create states of mind and motivate action without
								regard to their "truth" or "falsity" with respect to any criteria whatever.
							</p>
							<p>
								Until we embody the physiological laws of thought in a logic capable of correlating
								language with life, more philosophic speculation is barren and without any probability
								of correspondence with truth.</p>
							<p>
								Our only practical physiological means of insuring the correspondence of our imaginative
								activity with external conditions is by the use of special sensory organs in the
								acquisition of experience, the exercise of immediate observation, and the invention
								of apparatus in experiments. This is science.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our only practical means of insuring the correspondence of our imaginative activity
								with external or internal conditions beyond the capacity and ability of our sensory
								organs to acquire experience, to exercise immediate observation, or to invent and
								apply activity of the entire nervous system as "antennae" in the acquisition of
								knowledge by "feelings," which are to be understood only by the selective stimulation
								of memory elements in the activity of imagination from which all independent operations
								of the intellect have been rigidly excluded.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the domain of religion, not as a system of speculative belief, but as an
								operative function of intuition and faith that involves and includes the inspiration
								of all the so-called spiritual gifts, including prophecy and all types of mental
								phenomena to which have been falsely attributed occult or psychic connotations.</p>
							<p>
								The exercise of the latter to the exclusion of the former produces but half-men
								and half-truths: i.e., mystics and mysticism. The exercise only of the former produces
								but half-men and half-truths: i.e., skeptics and skepticism.
							</p>
							<p>
								The materialism of science and the spiritualism of religion are each in themselves
								incapable of embracing the whole man or the whole truth. It is only the two together,
								functioning in one man, not in separate men, that produces the capacity of mankind
								to a universal consciousness, coordination and understanding.
