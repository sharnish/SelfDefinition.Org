							<p>
								PERIODICALLY in the history of the world it becomes essential for men mentally akin
								to find each other, to know each other, and in unison deliver a message of truth
								to enlighten, to strengthen, to correct mistakes, in an effort to avoid just what
								has happened to us all. But how is this to be done, if not by education? Not to
								condemn the methods of others, but to substitute a better way that will defend itself.</p>
							<p>
								All religions embody good and have bettered the world. There are still two factors:
								Faith and Science; two rules, and both are evidently right. Is it expecting too
								much that Religion and Science together create the third principle, resulting in
								the transformation of the world into one human family of many children, each to
								his own? With Science to preserve order by eliminating fraud and trickery, there
								would be no fear of judging the innocent as guilty.</p>
							<p>
								As man is inclined toward superstition, he naturally falls an easy prey to those
								clever enough to deceive his eye. In fact, some of the brightest minds of the nineteenth
								and twentieth centuries have been completely deceived in this way. The possibility
								of our loved ones returning after having passed away, or at least of sending us
								some message or thought, cannot be doubted. But it is the unreliability of the method
								used to receive these messages, as well as the unreliability of the person receiving
								them, that gives rise to a question. The truth is often exaggerated, and the open-minded
								victim easily duped.</p>
							<p>
								Within mankind there is a power so great that it would be dangerous to know it until
								we are perfect in humility and self-control. Until then it is hidden from us by
								our selfish, animal nature, which causes the mind to become cloudy and discontented.
							</p>
							<p>
								Even as trees sleep in the winter and blossom again in the spring, so also does
								humanity alternately sleep and blossom: periodically come the fruits of genius,
								great minds and sensitive souls who give voice, as "human radios," to the great
								broadcasting of the ages, the Song of Truth. And with their passing, humanity gradually
								falls asleep again until the next "wave" or cycle.</p>
							<p>
								In this spiritual sleep, this ebb of the soul, is the heyday of false prophets:
								therein will be found the origin of superstition, in "imitation" of what did hold
								some truth, but is now a word without meaning, a body without a soul.
							</p>
							<p class="totop">
								<a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">top of page</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Why do supposedly great but false prophets and teachers flourish for a day and then
								die in obscurity, leaving no flourishing field to prove the fertility of their teaching?</p>
							<p>
								The shell of the wheat was there; the words and phrases-all borrowed to feed people
								who do not think for themselves; and even when planted, gave up no fruit because
								the spirit of God was lacking, and because they who professed, denied the simplicity
								which was the soul itself.</p>
							<p>
								Man slowly approaches the epoch of the human radio. His antenna of imagination opens
								that inner ear that hears the silent broadcast of the ages. It still vibrates in
								the atmosphere. Man's mortal ear already hears the music and the words…</p>
							<p>
								We may view this psychologically rather than from a spiritual or religious point
								of view; nevertheless, it is clear that an even greater revelation will accompany
								the discovery of a "radio" in the human mind than what took place industrially,
								internationally, and domestically with the invention and introduction of radio into
								our homes.
							</p>
							<p>
								The entire universe is within the human head in the same manner that music broadcast
								from various cities all over the world is within the radio, or within the room in
								which it is being received.
							</p>
							<p>
								We forget that a well-governed and trustworthy imagination contains the tools that
								make education from the specifications of wisdom; that therein also are the antennae
								of man with which he searches for God: that aerial to receive the message; the chamber
								of transformation in which the "word is made flesh'; where thoughts are dramatized
								in symbols that are revelations if they be attuned to "facts."</p>
							<p>
								We still have more to learn of the rooms of man's mind, to find the doors leading
								to that religious ecstasy, the mystery, the frenzy of the aborigines, the bliss
								of divinity felt by martyrs and saints, the hypnotic power of our professional men--all
								still in its infancy.</p>
							<p>
								No one will deny facts, unless he has a subtle purpose to use opportunities for
								selfish purposes. Truth is self-evident, and needs no support. It supports itself.
								And if the pillars of a structure are lies, it will collapse. Still, the spirit
								of true support is ever present, so that a new permanent structure shall rise from
								the ashes and dust of falsehood. There are ever present health germs to continue
								life, even among death germs. That is the law of adjustment, compensation, and growth,
								the manifestation of life.</p>
							<p>
								All that matters most to man is back of his own eyes, and there he flounders in
								the dark, thinking he thinks a thought, but unaware of the origin of that thought,
								or of its fruits; "imagining' things without the slightest conception of the power
								and mechanism that he is using.</p>
							<p class="totop">
								<a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">top of page</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Surely we may learn much by watching the insect with its antennae moving in every
								direction, sensing the danger we cannot see. It protects itself without the great
								gift to man: imagination. It only acts upon its inherent power of instinct. It uses
								its antennae to sense approaching danger, which it avoids, but knows not its source,
								without reason. Why should not man have a more highly developed sense by the protection
								of reason, or the cause with its effect?</p>
							<p>
								If the same amount of energy and education had been utilized for psychological,
								mental, and spiritual power as for the comforts of economic, mechanical, and electrical
								power, what would have been accomplished to further the progress of humanity?</p>
							<p>
								There is no excuse for man to underestimate the power of the mind at the loss of
								his inheritance from God or Nature, from ancestry, or self-acquired. If we refuse
								to use reason and logic as a foundation to intuition, whom can we blame for the
								failure in evolution? whom but our own negligence? Nature offers us her fruits.
								Why are men ashamed to admit their belief for or against spirituality?</p>
							<p>
								How can anyone judge or give an opinion of the power of prayer, of Christianity,
								or of the prophets, unless he has given it a lifetime of experience to see the answer,
								and then left us the records, by which we may judge?</p>
							<p>
								There is much that might be said of certain facts and truths that would but compel
								us to search the Book of Mistakes made by those who were sincere, but too enthusiastic
								to allow Nature to grow in its own good time; where swords have been unsheathed
								without provocation, only in fear of apparently losing opportunities. If there be
								any loss, let us go back and see whether the purse had a hole in it: whether the
								compass was influenced by a nail; whether the watch kept good time as it should,
								or whether we were controlled by our stomach, our heart, or our mind....
							</p>
							<p>
								We are ever traveling toward the future, where all truth is born. Should we waste
								time in disputing the possibility of truth we think we have not, or be open to the
								possibilities that the world shall know tomorrow, as yesterday gave us for today?</p>
							<p>
								We have a duty we owe to humanity--to those who have knocked upon doors of empty
								churches, temples, and schools, but not prisons. We must help men and women who
								can do work, not as missionaries; nor under the flags of politics, cults, or isms,
								but just pure, cleanhearted leaders who are handicapped, discouraged, held back--being
								used as steppingstones to respectability by the profane.</p>
							<p>
								Why waste time, paper, and ink analyzing flavors, the taste of fruit? Let us eat
								what Nature has given for thousands of years; and turn it into good health, joy,
								long life, and normal appreciative thoughts, so that the real knowledge of life
								may be born normally for today and tomorrow, and not for thousands of years hence.
							</p>
							<p>
								We cannot afford to spend much time considering the opinions or methods of yesterday;
								nor stop to harvest their fruits today, when we must plant for a new generation,
								knowing that all those who do not now understand will gradually do so as time passes,
								for "Time proveth all things."</p>
							<p>
								The individual awakening and cultivation of intuition is the foremost concern of
								all leaders and teachers who may be pioneering in the prevenience of a new era;
								until all education is "Prevenient education" our problems as a nation shall not
								be solved.
							</p>
							<p class="totop">
								<a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">top of page</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Written history contains no records of a nation in the position in which the United
								States of American now stands, with the possibilities in its hands for the manifestation
								of a spirit of prevenience that would enable it to become the dominating culture
								of a new epoch by demonstrating a new level of revolutionary "warfare" without muscle
								and bloodshed, as an example to set before the other nations of the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								Who shall plant the seeds of the new viewpoint in the ground thus made ready; who
								but those thinkers and leaders who prove by their stability, adaptability, reliability,
								and endurance that they have been chosen by their own fertility to survive as the
								foundations for new structures and the roots of a new generation?</p>
							<p>
								As Americans should we not fight for what America represents, as the melting pot
								of the world, with many laws inherited, yet obeying but one law, that of our pioneering
								forefathers for freedom of thought, speech, and religion founded on logic, reason,
								and reality, as well as (and above all) one Supreme Being of power that may be clothed
								in any raiment desired, but internally one and the same hub of that <em>Wheel of Truth</em>,
								where the spokes are teachers and exemplifiers; the rim, those whose personal responsibility
								is to protect those who teach; the steel hoop, the beasts of burden; and the movements,
								of the combined machinery of the world?</p>
							<p>
								Things have only been partly done. The mansion is still in process. We are all but
								workers at the scaffolding (parties and divisions) of American as well as Christianity.
								When a mansion is done, what happens to the scaffolding? It is torn down, revealing
								the completed examples as models for a Universal Christianity and a United Nations
								of the World.
							</p>
							<p>
								The two are inseparables, the north and south poles of each other, the spirit and
								the body, the ideals and the nation, the way of life and the government to make
								it possible.
							</p>
							<p>
								Can we expect to crystallize Utopia and usher in the long-heralded <em>Millennium</em>?
								That's not the question. It is the dream and the vision that point down the highway.
								Though we fall by the wayside and never reach it, we must believe in it. Otherwise
								we travel in a vicious circle. It is only the hope that leads us on.
							</p>
							<p>
								The problems of the ages still face us, but today we are better equipped than ever
								before to understand them, if we will only discard the limiting thought habits of
								ancestral education, and adopt the mental tools and implements offered us today,
								with which to understand and shape tomorrow.</p>
							<p>
								What excuse have we to neglect a progress that we may further in our own way? Who
								should be to blame in the misunderstanding of a bugle call-the wounded lips that
								fail to shape the notes, the bugle, or the man who is supposed to know the signal
								and fails to execute it?
							</p>
							<p>
								Someone must hit the gong so the blind may hear the hour. Another must turn the
								hands for the deaf, so they may see. Why the slate and chalk, memory's purpose and
								traces of the blueprint? Surely there must be many laborers to one architect or
								overseer. Why should we deny our destiny? If there be an effect, surely there has
								been a cause. If we hear an echo there must have been a voice to send it. If you
								or I have an ideal to express, whence came its cause? Others may try to play music
								and fail. Why? Is it for the want of a piano, a melody, or trained fingers?</p>
							<p>
								If you have dreams and visions only, without framing them exposed to eyes that seek
								them, you speak a language that you alone understand. It is useless to those called
								to cooperate with you &ndash; workmen of the temple idle, waiting for your designs
								while you sleep, and they vanish. Whom do you think shall spin, weave, work in the
								quarries, or gather timber to materialize dreams given you, if you fail to sing
								your melody?</p>
							<p class="totop">
								<a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">top of page</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Why cannot more men utilize the gifts they really possess, but which they do not
								seem to realize are in their possession? Why carry the newly felled trees to be
								made into lumber, when beasts of burden would gladly carry them for a cast-off meal?
								Why all the spiritual confusion throughout the world, when there is no discord where
								truth exists?
							</p>
							<p>
								How many fine minds are there hidden in obscurity at the front line of commercialism,
								shackled to an organization because of wages and an inferiority complex; while if
								but allowed to dream, away from the grinding note of gears, a new musician, poet,
								or scientist may be born. Give men a chance to spread their shallow or clay roots.
								The top can always be pruned from faults. But let their roots alone, to allow character
								to prove their value before we forget why we live, and how.</p>
							<p>
								Why do not men of learning come together to exchange views, as pugilists do blows;
								wrestlers, holds; athletes, feats of endurance, so that monuments of knowledge may
								be like large, fine trees as landmarks to the wayfaring man who is traveling through
								unknown lands, the labyrinth of the world's paths, to his home and loved one, whether
								mortal or immortal, and do those things of the sake of truth instead of wealth and
								glory? Truth itself is glorified, and so are they who dispense it.</p>
							<p>
								The progress of the world's education, research, and understanding would be so much
								more enhanced if we allowed thinking men to do their thinking without a handicap.
								Let them be able to think and do their best while the man with muscle removes stumbling
								blocks so the dreamer may dream visions governed by thinkers for the doers to give
								it life.
							</p>
							<p>
								If each man or personality in the entire world represented an individual key to
								his greatest treasure vault, we would not need to fear a burglar picking our lock,
								for no two keys would be alike. Still, all are expected to eat from the same plate
								the same amount, dress alike, be punished alike, be rewarded alike, and die alike.
								Why not examine the tumblers of these human locks and see who should be trusted
								most, and with what responsibility, so that we will find geniuses to teach us short
								methods, instead of waiting for them every century or so?</p>
							<p>
								The trouble with most of us is that we shape things to suit ourselves, according
								to past acquirements; whereas we should permit truth to come to us, crystallizing
								in its own shape; we should then try to figure out what the shape its.</p>
							<p>
								The seed of truth must preserve itself for future generations in a vocabulary untainted
								by those words that have attracted to themselves all the odium of a confusion of
								fraudulence, fakery, trickery, and overgrown superstition.
							</p>
							<p class="totop">
								<a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">top of page</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								The world is waiting for someone to come to teach them; all looking in different
								directions for another coming, save those who believe that He has already come.
								Does one appear upon a crest of notoriety? Then it is not He. Does he found a cult
								or a "system"? The Maser himself comes not in these ways-but as a breeze across
								a prairie where labor all notions, all races, sects, and creeds…each fanned by the
								breeze, and differently; each giving expression to his reception and appreciation
								of the One Gentle Breeze through this world: each clothing a Christ in virtues thus
								conceived. One is wet, and the breeze dries him. One is covered with dust, and it
								blows away this dust, fanning the hair from his eyes. One draws a bow at his enemy,
								and the breeze prevents, carrying it back to the sender. One aims with the breeze
								a dart just to warn, and fall short of its mark, but the breeze carries it on to
								the heart of him who deserved the death-blow that it was…</p>
							<p>
								At best we are but cogs in the Wheel of Time, and call it "history"-which is but
								the echo for philosophers: the flames, and the smoke rolling away; cause and effect,
								blinded by the blindness of man to know neither the beginning nor the end, nor what
								is one; thinking mortal what is immortal; feeling the heat; seeing the smoke; combining
								nothing as one cause-thinking only in jets, as the beating and breathing of heart
								and lungs. Is it not true?</p>
							<p>
								The only cause a man has for not realizing his power as a man, is that he never
								has tried to select the mental food his brain should digest to prove how in all
								simplicity his ideals lie at his feet if he will but select the mental food to accomplish
								all his desires that but cast their shadow before him. Let him but cast their shadow
								before him. Let him but awaken his gift of logic and reason to realize that to think
								a thing is to shape action, energy, and influence to that creation thought. For
								we only want those things made manifest by what we have allowed our brain to consume.</p>
							<p>
								Thus we arrive at the purpose of these prefatory and fragmentary paragraphs, which
								is to provide a few samples of the food for thought that has sustained me in the
								continuation of that quest of which the beginning is subjected to both chronicle
								and commentary in <em>Gates of the Mind</em>.</p>
