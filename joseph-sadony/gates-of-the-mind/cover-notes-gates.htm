                                THROUGHOUT his life of eighty-three years the late Joseph Sadony, scientist, philosopher,
                                inventor and poet, searched for the truth about man, God and the universe. "Seek
                                the truth," he said, "and when you have found it, follow it, for it is God." Perhaps,
                                more than any other man of our time, he found the truth for which all men, to greater
                                or lesser degree, seek. What Sadony sought - and found - was a universal law applicable
                                to all science, nature and human nature. Through his studies of atomic energy, gravitation,
                                electricity, light, heat, magnetism and other scientific matters, he determined
                                upon the unity of all things: atoms, molecules, human beings, the world about us,
                                and galaxies of stars. All, including the body and mind of man, are one, each and
                                all constantly receiving and emitting radiant energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In his laboratories on his eighty-acre estate on White Lake, Michigan, near Muskegon,
                                Sadony spent many years in scientifically proving his theories, many of which he
                                knew intuitively. Behind his experiments and writings was the basic purpose to free
                                the mind of man from the restrictions of environment, faulty thinking, false intellectual
                                concepts and all other impediments to a true understanding of himself and the cosmos.
                                He saw in man an extraordinary potential which such freedom could bring. His own
                                intuitive abilities - powers which he said are possessed by everyone, though usually
                                dormant - enabled him to predict future events accurately, to "see" happenings in
                                far-distant parts of the world. On one notable occasion, through his mental powers
                                he was able to influence and direct the captain of a ship to another ship in distress
                                during a violent storm on Lake Michigan, with the result that many lives were saved.
                                This dramatic rescue was documented,
                                <!-- (continued on back flap) -->
                                as were many of his "psychic" accomplishments, and presented on a nation-wide radio
                                broadcast.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although Sadony was well known to scientists, philosophers and world leaders - among
                                his hundreds of correspondents he numbered Gandhi, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kipling,
                                Tagore, King Gustav V of Sweden, King George VI of England and Admiral Byrd - he
                                avoided personal publicity and was little known to the general public. This volume,
                                a condensation of his autobiography, in which he explains his "gifts" and his theory
                                of Radiant Energy, the source of all life, will come as a boon and deeply significant
                                revelation to all seekers after truth.

                                Joseph A. Sadony was born in Mountbauer, Germany, February 22, 1877. He came with
                                his parents to the United States when he was a small boy, and spent his childhood
                                in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Later his family moved to Chicago, where as a teenager he
                                was able, through his innate mental powers, to solve crimes which had baffled the
                                Chicago police. Soon the police were making regular use of his special abilities.
                                Later he spent a period of time in the West, where he conducted for President Theodore
                                Roosevelt a special investigation of conditions on Indian reservations. In 1906
                                he married Lillian Mary Kochem of Kentucky. The same year he bought the eighty-acre
                                estate near Muskegon, which he had visualized in precise physical detail, although
                                he had never before seen it, and which was to be his home for the remainder of his
                                life. It was on these grounds that he established his Educational Research Laboratories,
                                where he was to conduct his scientific work until his death in September, 1960.
                                Sadony was active in civic and fraternal work in his community and for many years
                                wrote a daily column, "Give Thought," which appeared in the Muskegon Chronicle.
                                He is survived by his wife and two sons, Joseph Junior and Arthur J.
