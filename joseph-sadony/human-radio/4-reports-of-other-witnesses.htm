							<h4>
								Section A
							</h4>
							<!-- split chapter here for page length, Start of Warnings part 2 -->

							<p>
								CASE 107 &ndash; Mr. Sadony was introduced to a Mr. A.A. at the Sylvan Beach Pier. In the course of conversation he told Mr. A. that his head, for the moment, resembled a long high bridge. Mr. A. replied, "That is strange, I am working on the new specifications of the bridge crossing the Mississippi River. I am an electrical Engineer." (Was this a form of visualizing the thought?)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 135 &ndash; Mr. Sadony warned William McKie, druggist in Kalamazoo, to be careful. He predicted an explosion. I received a letter from Mrs. B. enclosing a clipping, and saying "The prophecy to Mr. McKie came, and he is now lying at Borgess Hospital, severely burned as a result of the explosion. Mr. Sadony predicted to Mrs. B. that she was to meet a light complected man by name of Charles, a dentist. A month later she met a Dr. Charles H---, dentist, and married him the 20th of May.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 136 &ndash; One evening in 1902 a Dr. Bell of Chicago, interviewed Mr. Sadony with regard to his experiences in psychometrizing. He brought forth an odd pocket-book, asking Mr. S. to tell him what thoughts it brought. "I imagine myself riding along on horseback", was the reply, "I stopped at a bridge, heard a peculiar noise, and jumped from the horse." Dr. Bell then explained that the little pocket-book was made from the skin of the snake which had the "peculiar noise", and which he had actually killed at the brook.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony then said, "Doctor, do you fear the dog of one of your patients?" "No", answered the Doctor. "There is one that is dangerous, but he is tied up." "Why don't you carry a gun?" asked Mr. S., intimating that there was danger. That was the last time Mr. Sadony ever saw Dr. Bell alive, as the dog broke loose and bit him, thus causing him to die of hydrophobia.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 153 &ndash; Mr. Sadony told a Mr. B. that he would change his vocation in two weeks and three days. He replied that this was impossible as he had been in the same business for nine years. Mr. B. returned later, however, to tell Mr. Sadony that this had come to pass, although he could not understand how.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony told Mrs. B. to insure her husband, that she would thank him for it in two weeks. Ten days from this time he was struck by an auto and his skull fractured. Having five children, Mrs. B. was indeed thankful.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 399 &ndash; C.S., night clerk of the ---- Tavern, was threatened with death by a man whom he had reproached for appearing vulgar to a lady. Shortly after, Mr. Sadony advised him not to carry fire-arms. He did so, however, and one night encountered the man who had threatened him, and who now sprang at him. Mr. C.S. shot and killed him, after which he was arrested. Mr. Sadony told him in a letter not to fear as he would be acquitted, which came to pass.
							</p>
							<p>
								(NOTE: Letter 9998, from Mr. C.S. himself reads, "I take great pleasure in being able to say that I was acquitted as you said I would be.")
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 549 &ndash; September 1, 1922, Mr. Sadony predicted that before very long we would read in the papers of two attempts at assassination, one in a little country near Greece and Turkey, and one in France which would create quite a stir, as it would concern some prominent figure, such as Marshal Foche or the President. There were three witnesses to this statement. Nine others were told of the prophecy within the next day or two. Sept. 5th, clippings were found, "Arrests Bare Plot to Kill Royal Family of Roumania," and two others: Paris, Sept. 9th, "Student Fires on President's Home"; "Attempts to Shoot Millerand Fails."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 683 &ndash; Mr. W.R. of the Tannery was told that four inspectors would be sent to the tannery, who would find upon examination that the leather was far below average; also that an offer would be made to him, and that within three weeks there would be a man hurt badly on the second floor of the tannery. He was warned to look after the machine so that he would not be blamed. The four inspectors arrived. Four hides out of two hundred were accepted. He received an offer, and in three weeks a man's finger was torn off on the second floor at that particular machine.

							<h4>
								Section B
							</h4>
							<p>
								CASE 671 &ndash; "In 1907 Mr. Sadony and l were on a train coming from Belvidere, Ill. He made the remark, "The Engineer of this train seems nervous. I feel nervous too, but I think it will be over before we reach Elgin, which is the next station." Ten minutes later the train gave a sudden jerk, followed by spasmodic jerks. The connecting rod of the engine had broken, nearly causing a serious wreck."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1031 &ndash; On the first of January, 1923, Mr. Sadony told several friends that during the year to come there would be three occasions when the papers would take more than usual interest in a death in the moving picture world. One, he said, seemed to be, more than a movie star. One was a general favorite of many fans. The third case seemed different, not exactly a star, yet with stars involved. It looked something like murder, but he was not sure that it was actually a "death". The friends who kept track of this matter each offered the same list at the end of a year. The first was Wallace Reid, the "general favorite", (Jan. 17, 1923). The second was Sarah Bernhardt, who had been featured in pictures, but was "more than a movie star" being first of all a Tragedienne. The third, at the close of the year, being reported in the papers on the first day of the new year, was not a movie star, nor was it a death, but it "looked something like murder". The headlines read, "Two Movie Stars held after rich oil man is shot in his apartment."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 672 &ndash; "But by far the most remarkable prediction to me occurred when I was with Mr. Sadony in Los Angeles in 1906. At 3:00 A.M. on Feb. 1st, Mr. Sadony awoke himself, and then woke me to tell me that someone was passing away and calling for me. On Feb. 3rd, I received a telegram saying that my father had passed away in New York at precisely that moment."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 674 &ndash; In the year 1910 Mr. Sadony predicted that the Cayuga (a steamer) would sink, or nearly sink. A little later it struck a deadhead and had to land its passengers at once.
							</p>
							<div class="image-div">
								<img src="images/steamer-cayuga-1910.jpg" alt="Steamer Cayuga, Toronto to Niagara Route, circa 1910" title="Steamer Cayuga, circa 1910" />
								<p style="" class="note80">Steamer Cayuga, Toronto to Niagara, Route circa 1910</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								Case 680 &ndash; One summer Mr. Sadony remarked to Mrs. A., and M.L., as they sat on the shore of White Lake, "I feel sorry for the man who is to drown in a few hours." A few hours later a man was drowned near the Tannery.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 666 &ndash; "One time white eating at the table, Mr. Sadony made the assertion to the rest of us who happened to be with him, 'In twenty minutes from now, I see one hundred souls going down in a ship in the northeast.' He explained that a direct line from where he sat, lying between the Atlantic Ocean and Michigan, would locate the position. We found afterwards that the name of the boat was 'The Empress of Ireland,' and that it sank at the time mentioned."
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. May 29, 1914. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Empress_of_Ireland">en.wikipedia.org/<wbr />wiki/<wbr />RMS_Empress_<wbr />of_<wbr />Ireland</a>&nbsp;]
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 667 &ndash; "Another time, when I was having dinner with Mr. Sadony at the Saratoga Café in Chicago, we ordered soup. When the waitress brought it in, he said, "You certainly were speedy in removing the mouse that fell in this soup." She blushed and quickly returned it, but would not wait upon us. We made inquiry and found that this had actually occurred."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 710 &ndash; Mr. A.T. Mills was told that his son, Frank, then at London, would soon sign a big contract as leading man for a large Theatrical Company. A clipping soon stated "A cablegram to friends on this side of the water brings information that Frank Mills, the well known actor, has signed a contract as leading man with Olga Nethersole."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 253 &ndash; The following incident happened when Mr. Sadony was quite young. He visited the home of a man in Belvidere who took three or four swallows from a bottle of iron tonic at certain times of the day and before retiring.
							</p>
							<p>
								One evening Mr. S. was in the upper part of the house, when he called out suddenly, "What's that you're drinking!" He heard a crash of glass below, and ran to find his host in the pantry, pale as a ghost. "My God", he asked, "Why did you say that." "I don't know, I just had to," replied Mr. S., who was just as startled as the other, and hardly realized what had happened. They both looked at the bottle on the floor, which had been to the man's lips. In reaching to his accustomed shelf of medicines in the dark, confident with long habit, he had taken a bottle of iodine which had been misplaced.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 557 &ndash; ln 1911 Mr. Sadony sent for three large fire extinguishers. There were those who thought this foolish, with running water in the house, and no fire at the time. He insisted, however, and filled them at once. Six hours afterwards, at 2:00 A.M., he was working in his shop. He saw flames in the window. With the chemical the house was saved. The lamp had exploded and set fire to the bedding.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 558 &ndash; On meeting for the first time a Mrs. R.W., Mr. Sadony remarked that her face appeared to him, for a moment like an old man with a violin. She was startled and replied that this was strange because she had been thinking of such a man whom she had met at a musical in Paris. She expected to return to take lessons from him, if possible.

							<h4>
								Section C
							</h4>
							<p>
								CASE 158 &ndash; On the morning of September 2, 1917, while sitting at the breakfast table, Mr. Sadony told his family and others, who were with him, that he saw C.C. overlooking his aeroplane (Lafayette Escadrille at the front in France). He was smoking a cigarette, and saying to a blond man with a very short mustache, "Believe me, I'll get someone soon."
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony then spoke of seeing a German repairing something on a broken wing. Later he saw C. go up, and while about six hundred feet high he followed another machine, trying to rise over it. Then this same German came into view far above C., and, nearing him, shot twice. C. fell.
							</p>
							<p>
								This so impressed Mr. Sadony that he immediately wrote C. a letter, warning him, and stating "---if you will think of me and my words when in real danger, I will be able to take you by the hand and congratulate you.... But... be on the job.... I know what I am talking about...."
							</p>
							<p>
								This was the last. A cable from Paris, dated October 4th, told of his having been seen falling down out of control, back of the German lines, after an engagement with three German planes.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 371 &ndash; A. Mr. H.R. and his brother came from the East and worked for a wholesale house on Water Street, in Chicago, by the river. One day Mr. Sadony told them to "lay off" and come up, as he had something very important to tell them. They came, and that afternoon the building where they were employed, caved in, killing a number of men.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 547 &ndash; (August 31, 1922) Mr. Sadony spoke in the morning to all present at his breakfast table, (nine in number) of seeing mentally some miners caught in a pocket. He said that there were 47 miners, three of whom were still alive as he spoke, trying to dig out. The rescue party were trying to dig down to them, he said, and in a day or two we would read about it in the papers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Monday, September 1st, Miss A.H. found an article in the Chicago Tribune, dated Jackson, California, August 31st, and giving the details of the disaster. Reference to 47 miners removes the case from likelihood of "coincidence".
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 612 &ndash; In their first conversation Mr. Sadony asked Mr. H. about a business in which he seemed to be interested, saying that he saw mentally a house in construction, many houses in construction, but the whole matter puzzled him because there did not seem to be any evidence of occupation at any time, present or future, and their construction seemed odd, as well as the size. Mr. H. and his friend (Mr. W.) were very much amused, as one of the projects which Mr. H. was then interested in launching and furthering, was a new kind of toy, a peculiar kind of building blocks with which children could easily construct substantial little houses of any miniature size, according to the number of blocks at hand.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. S. wrote afterward to Mr. H., "I could not estimate how a structure could be built without anyone living in it! It confused me because it was so unique. But it is through these experiments that I obtain further knowledge in my researches. And as the language of symbolism was the first created, it is the most permanent and least confusing, and I naturally accept these impressions as truth. But it requires language to express, which is confusing, as it was in your case."

							<h4>
								Section D
							</h4>
							<p>
								The following has been selected from records in the notebook of one of Mr. Sadony's friends.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Mr. Sadony was on the production staff of a certain play in which Miss F.D. spoke the lines, 'A-Chang, another star is falling from the sky....' (meaning a death). Upon one occasion in calling this, her voice affected him so strangely that he could hardly speak. He felt the shadow of the death from which he had been doing his best to save her. Standing back of the scenes together they had talked often, and he had warned her repeatedly about certain things. The next day he wrote her a long letter, advising in detail and asking that she listen to his words before it was too late, so that in August of the following year she might look back in realizing the truth of all that he had said. But she did not heed his warnings. She did not write him at the time he had suggested. He could do no more. Six months before 'August' she was found dead." (Circumstances are here omitted, but it was by no means a natural or a necessary death.)
							</p>
							<p>
								"Then there was Mr. M.C. whom Mr. Sadony told in an interview to go slowly at Chicago Avenue and Wells St. He was one of the oldest gripmen on the Lincoln Ave. carline. The warning was not heeded. There were a number of men working at the corner mentioned. A colored man raised his head and turned around. He was struck and killed."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Mr. M.C. later brought another man to see Mr. Sadony. Mr. S. said that he could see nothing for him after Thursday. He seemed to be there, but in a sort of haze through which Mr. S. could barely see him. He could see a clock on Monroe Street, as the car in which the man seemed to be sitting passed a jewelry store. It was nine-thirty. The man made light of it. The next Thursday at nine-thirty he dropped dead of heart failure at Monroe Street."

							<h4>
								Section E
							</h4>
							<p>
								The following cases are selected from another notebook as recorded by one witness, and corroborated in many of its details by ten to fifteen others:
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1009 &ndash; One time, when eating some blueberries that had been brought to him, he spoke of what he saw "through the eyes of one of the berries." He described the scene, which was in large proportions, a giant burned stump on one side and nearby an enormous tree, also black and burned. We were told by the friend who had brought the berries that in just such a location the berries had been picked, but that the burned stump was quite small, and the tree of average size.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1010 &ndash; And again, some honey was sent to Joseph from another state. As he tasted it he closed his eyes, and said that he was imagining that he was one of the bees, and described the scene that he saw while in search of flowers for the honey that he was tasting. He wrote this description in the letter in which he thanked his unknown friends for the gift. They replied that the scene he had described was their own home and farm, where the bees had indeed obtained the very honey that they had sent him.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1014 &ndash; At lunch one noon in January of 1922, Joseph asked me to remind him to tell me of something that he saw, but which he did not like to mention at the table. Later I asked him, and he told me that he had seen a family in Russia eating the limb of a little girl. The rest was cooked and ready to eat. It was too horrible for him to look longer. The child was not their own, but a neighbor's. He spoke also of an old woman that had been consumed.... We found a clipping in the paper dated February 1st, which spoke of "an old woman and a child of nine that have followed the cats and dogs that already have been consumed."
							</p>
							<p class="center">
								* * *
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1024 &ndash; When Mrs. [Sabella] Nitti's case first came out in the papers, there appeared no other outcome than that she would hang. In fact she was sentenced, yet Joseph said "Mrs Nitti will never hang." He repeated this more than once, as time passed. So I made a note. "Mrs. Nitti will not hang. Watch papers." A clipping of April 14th read, "Supreme Court saves Mrs. Nitti from Gallows." "New Trial granted Mrs. Nitti." Other clippings gave further details. Joseph explained the form in which this prediction came to him. He "imagined" seeing the mother's hand stretched toward the Master praying, "Do not let her enter Eternity that way." The look on the Master's face was as it had been when He said to the woman, "---then neither do I condemn thee. Go -- and sin no more."
							</p>
							<p>
								Addendum, December 1, 1924: Papers reported "Mrs. Nitti Freed. Case is Dropped."

							<p>
								CASE 1025 &ndash; At breakfast on the morning of Feb. 15th, 1924, Joseph told us of having awakened early "seeing" a man striking his wife with an axe. Why he should have "tuned in" with this at just that time, he did not know. A few days later a clipping was found among some papers about to be thrown away. What he had "seen" in his passing "glimpse" was happening at the time. "Attacks his wife with axe," reads the caption. "Green Valley, Ill., Feb. 15th, Ed. Ary, a farmer living seven miles southeast of here, after attacking his wife and three daughters with an axe early this morning, hanged himself in a grove near his home in Malone Township".... etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1026 &ndash; As we were driving downtown one day, we passed a Mr. M. and his family. As we approached them Joseph said, "Just now he is saying, "Here comes Sadony's car." One of the boys afterwards asked Mr. M's daughter what her father had said as they approached. "He said, 'Here come's Sadony's car'" she replied.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1027 &ndash; The son of the owner of a gravel boat was drowned in White Lake. The coast guard were unable to locate the body. That night, at midnight, Joseph went out with a friend, equipped with an electric searchlight and a storage battery. He tied three sinkers to three corks and told the friend to row about in the dark, which he did, making circles with his eye on a dock-light to keep his bearings. Suddenly Joseph felt that they were above the body and dropped one of the corks. They repeated the process until the third cork had been dropped, then they turned on the light. At one side of the boat they beheld the three corks floating within a short distance from each other. In the midst of them Joseph put the light down into the water. He was himself quite startled to see the beam of light shining directly upon a dead and upturned face. The body was wedged between two logs so that the drags of the coast-guard had passed over it without revealing its presence.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1051 &ndash; We drove to Muskegon one day in October of 1923. Joseph pointed to a particular telephone post as we passed it &ndash; only one out of the thousands along the Michigan State Highway &ndash; and he said, "That post will be smashed by a car. We will watch and see." But November and December passed without the sign of a scratch. On January 15th we drove along the same road for the first time in a number of days. The post was broken and splintered. Markings on the ground showed plainly where a car had left the road at great speed....
							</p>
							<p>
								"A new bridge was being built over the river between Whitehall and Montague. Joseph pointed to a particular section of railing in the temporary detour bridge. 'Next time we pass, that will be broken,' he said. 'At that point a driver will lose confidence in passing a Southbound car.' And the next day, but one, we found the railing under repair at the point foreseen.''
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1029 &ndash; One evening Joseph parked his car in front of a small cigar and candy store. The little Italian keeper came out and began to tell him of his troubles with his wife, and of how terrible and cruel she was.

								Joseph told him to be good to her, "for just two weeks," he said, "And you will not regret it. Everything will be for the best then. She will not be with you after that. She will be happy. You will be happy, if you have been kind and good."
							</p>
							<p>
								"She will die," he told us after we had left. "He will then know that I knew, if he does not now."
							</p>
							<p>
								Three weeks later we drew up in front of the same little store. The little man ran out and offered Joseph a big fat cigar as a gift.
							</p>
							<p>
								"By golly, you were right," he beamed. "She died last week."
							</p>

							</p>
							<p>
								And from the same notebook we take the following extracts: "He predicted the transparent gas that was later developed and put to such deadly use.... He saw a fleet of submarines before the submarine was invented.... He saw the secret of blowing up submarines by foreseeing the side blown out of the first one, and watching it sink.... And he told in details of remarkable methods of the spies and spoke in particular of a string of English towns on or near the coast where men kept carrier pigeons that left for Germany daily with intimate reports of what was going on....
							</p>
							<p>
								He foretold a Catastrophy that would occur within a month or two &ndash; seven to twelve hundred people taken at once, &ndash; not shot as in war, but like a tidal wave of souls going over. And not once but many times he foretold such catastrophies as well as describing the scene at the moment that it was happening so many hundred or thousands of miles away. Many times it would be the sinking of a great ship. Other times an earthquake. But always we would hear of it as prophesied, and with all details as described.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Then perhaps he would speak of some smaller Catastrophe happening nearer home, as for instance was recorded on January 6th, 1918. 'A house is burning so many miles north of here', he said. And the next day this was proved to be true.
							</p>
							<p>
								"And again on the 10th of the same month he was seized with the feeling of houses burning or burned, and of persons lost in the snow and suffering with cold. It was discovered that one house was at that time completely destroyed by fire, and that the entire family, father, mother and four children were forced into the snow in their night clothes. And at the same time there were other fires less serious. And a man, the caretaker of Alexander Dowie's home on White Lake was lost in a snowdrift and died....
							</p>
							<p>
								"And then, at times, Joseph would show us a small revolving model of the world, with a detailed map upon its surface. He would imagine that it was the Earth itself, and would describe the feelings and thoughts that came to him from different parts at different times. Past, Present and Future. And he would point to certain countries and certain cities, saying 'At this moment this and this is happening such and such a man is planning that; earthquakes here; a ship at the bottom of the sea there....'
							</p>
							<p>
								"And Joseph prophesied the end of the war in a remarkable manner. He said that the war would be soon over. But there was an American flag hanging before his home. It showed signs of the weather. He was about to replace it with a new one, but he changed his mind one day when he was asked about the war. 'When the last star falls from that flag,' he said, 'The World War will be over.' And it is a remarkable fact that the last star blew down on Nov. 11th of 1918, when the Armistice was signed.
							</p>
							<p>
								"It is hard to explain these things. Was this a wonderful 'sign' from some higher power, or did Joseph in foreseeing the time of the War's end, see also other details of the same day, thus making use of a strange 'coincidence', just as he might have seen a certain branch of a tree to fall, which would enable him to say, 'When that branch falls down the war will be over?'"

								CASE 568 &ndash; (A newspaper clipping) "J.A. Sadony foretold a great disaster which would happen the first week in May, and no one paid much attention to his prophecy. The fact is being recalled in the light of the Lusitania disaster."

							<p>
								CASE 568a &ndash; (Another clipping) "Jan. 30th Now that Italy is beginning to recover from effects of the earthquakes which have brought ruin and desolation, country folk here recall that Mr. J.A. Sadony prophesied three months ago the approach of an unusual commotion of the earth in the southern part of Europe shortly after New Year's...."

								CASE 163 &ndash; Letter 1184 &ndash; "... You then told me about papers my family had of which they were not aware, that would show that we owned a mine in the southwest, away from railroads. The mine had been abandoned, but was still in operation at that time, although we did not know this then. We found the papers, showing that the records, etc., had been burned in 1872, and were never heard of since, as the original owners were dead. But now we own the mine, after several lawsuits, etc. But had we not found out about them that year, and paid the taxes, we would have lost them, as jumpers had been paying the taxes and working them....

								Chatterjee Letters
							</h4>

							<p>
								CASE 484 &ndash; (Srikrishna Chatterjee, B. L. Cuttack, India: youngest son of Prem Chandra Tarkavagisha, distinguished Sanskrit Scholar of Bengal in the 19th Century.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Chatterjee wrote to ask, "Do you know of anybody who could give me a spirit photograph of my departed father? He was the Professor of Rhetoric in the Sanskrit College of Calcutta from the thirties to the middle sixties....
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony replied, "As I read your card, a strange feeling came to me, as if your father brought it; and with him a younger woman, with a most beautiful soul. He spoke first in a strange language, then in five different tongues, the last a universal language I understood. The names were all foreign ones, but I will give them as closely as possible. "My son, the only photograph of my features I shall imprint on your soul. My deeds are photographed in the minds of my past friends. There is no pen, color, or chemical on earth that can reproduce my present features.... These words you are now reading are the only photograph of myself I can give you...." Now then, dear brother, the voice of the woman seemed to speak, and she called the name "Birwar", "Borwar", or "Birtware", and continued as if speaking to him. It appears that this boy, who must be her son, was at the brink of Eternity twice. She further speaks of the joy of holding in her arms in the future this boy's male child. But she warns him to he more careful of his health. Then there were three more she spoke of &ndash; one older, the name sounded something like "Ratuswar", and then she came to your name, but it sounded so different than you have signed it that I could hardly understand, till she pointed to your card. When I asked mentally when she was blessed with a spiritual form, the answer as near as I could understand was 1902. The relief from her suffering was so great, as she said, that she has been in ecstasy since." (Remainder of message omitted here.)
							</p>
							<p>
								"I have no doubt whatsoever" wrote M. Chatterjee, "that the 'younger woman' is my dear departed wife. She went to the Higher Life on the 4th of January, 1903." (Note: four days later than 1902.) "She died of tetanus after terrible suffering of 16 or 17 days.... The name 'Birwar' is a contraction or corruption of 'Bireswar,' the name of my third boy. Yes he was on the brink of Eternity twice, his last illness being double pneumonia. I fear my dear wife will not have the joy of holding in her arms in the future this boy's male child, as he has set his face against marriage....
							</p>
							<p>
								"'Ratuswar' is a contraction of 'Ratueswar', my second boy.... As to my name.... Do you know that Hindu ladies do not pronounce their husband's names during their earth life?...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony wrote in a letter of June, 1916, "This I know positively, that your wife will influence your son to marry."
							</p>
							<p>
								In a letter of 1916, Mr. Sadony predicted the end of the war. Then in April, 1917, he wrote to the son, ''.... You will make the change to another city, and before you receive this letter you will have made two changes. At first things may appear slow, but it is as a moth in a cocoon, waiting for this cruel war to end, which will come to pass sooner than the world realizes, as even now the central powers have formed a plan to surrender with as good grace as possible under the circumstances. England and the Allies will be the gainers. India will awaken &ndash; at least her sons, who will make use of the opportunity to become coworkers with all the world...." (Remainder of letter omitted.)
							</p>
							<p>
								A postscript to another letter read, "I see one body in your place being divested of its soul. Let me know if this has occurred since my writing this, as I expect one more to follow. And tell Abhaya that God has called her to His home...."
							</p>
							<p>
								In Jan. 1920, a letter from the son stated, "I have passed through the changes you predicted."
							</p>
							<p>
								In March, the father wrote, "'You say, 'At one time since my last communication (1917) I seemed to see you at the portals of death.' If it was in August or September, 1918, you would be right, for I was then in the death-door condition. It was an attack of influenza.... You say 'You are now 68 years of age, are you not?' My answer is, I am now in the 67th year of my age.
							</p>
							<p>
								"In reference to your message of death, my eldest brother died a year after your seeing the vision, (March, 1918), and my second brother followed him in December. Your prophecy about my sister Abhaya appears to be erroneous. She is living still." (Note: She died one year and one month after the date of this letter.)
							</p>
							<p>
								"Your prophecy that my wife's spirit will influence my boy to marry has come true. He married in August last. He is now Professor at the Bhumikar Brahman College...."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Another prediction of yours has also been verified. In your letter of Feb. 20th, 1916, you predicted a 'Journey'. That journey was undertaken by me in October, 1919. In September I was seized with a desire to see my second boy and his two children and wife at Nasirabad, which must be about 1500 miles from this place.... I went to Calcutta, and thence proceeded.... I visited Arraha, Pushkar, Chitor, Udaipur, Ujjain, (and eight other places) in the course of my 'Journey'. I showed your letter to several friends, and told many more that you had predicted my journey upwards of three years before.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Addendum</strong> Case 484 &ndash; In February of 1924, Mr. Sadony entered his Study, stating that he distinctly felt the presence of Srikrishna Chatterjee, who at that time seemed to be in a dying or unconscious condition.
							</p>
							<p>
								Upon receipt of a booklet sent him by Mr. Sadony in April, Mr. Chatterjee wrote, "There is much truth in the dubiousness expressed by the words, 'if still with us', on the title page.... I was confined to bed by a profound nervous prostration for five months from Nov. 1923.... It seemed to me that consciousness had left me. It has now come back...."
							</p>
							<p>
								In August of 1924 Mr. Sadony wrote, "With regard to my writing 'If still with us', in presenting my booklet to you, my reason was a peculiar incident. About the middle of February, while in my Study, I seemed to feel your presence, just as if you were in that sphere which hovers between death and life, a living dreamland, the sphere which brings me so many messages &ndash; as if you were in the next world, but still anchored by a silk thread to this one. I began to fear, for I felt that you had something still to complete...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Just as this booklet was going to press, a letter was received from Mr. Chatterjee, in which he stated, "You are quite right in saying that in February last I was in that sphere which hovers between life and death &ndash; in the next world. Dear brother, it seemed to me that I died, and have come back to life again..."
							</p>
							<p>
								With this letter came a copy of the fifth edition of the life of Srikrishna Chatterjee's father, (Life and Slokas of Prem Chandra Tarkavagisa, by Rai Ramakhoy Chatterji Bahadur, printed by Norendra Nath Bose at the St. Andrew's Steam Printing Works, 81 Radha Bazar Street, Calcutta). It is written in Bengali, but at the close, in English, we find an account of the attempt which had been made to secure a spirit photograph of the Pandit Tarkavagisa. There is reference to communication with "Julia's Bureau" in London, the medium photographer Edward Wyllie, the Normans, etc. (From all of which excuse had been offered for failure to produce the desired photograph).
							</p>
							<p>
								Then the account concludes, "At last in 1916, Mr. Joseph A. Sadony, the great American psychic, when communicated with on the subject, wrote to say: &ndash; 'As I read your card', etc. (quoting in detail the message given at the beginning of this case, 484.)
							</p>
							<p>
								"Thus", concludes the writer, "the question whether a spirit photo of the Pandit could be had, has received its quietus after a correspondence with different psychics and mediums in almost all parts of the world extending over a period of nearly twelve years."

							<h4>
								Mr. Sadony's Remarks
							</h4>
							<p>
								"I leave it to others to explain these things," Mr. Sadony has often said of his work and experiences, "These are the results. I am willing to tell of the steps that led up to them. The Scientist must explain, if he can."
							</p>
							<p>
								If I have prophesied, even once, correctly, this is absolute proof of more than the possibility. We all possess the ability to "foresee", but our objective desires are too strong to allow subjective thoughts to live. Meals and sleep come too close together for most of us, and our desire for excitement and companionship deafens our ears to the secrets of seclusion. I am often sad for the want of someone to share with me all that fills the entire atmosphere from time immemorial, using me as a willing subject. Does this seem strange? The air today is filled with music and laughter, even in the dead loneliness and silence of the Wilderness. Tune in your radio and see!
