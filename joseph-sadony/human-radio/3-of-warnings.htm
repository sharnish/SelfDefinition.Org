							<h4>
								Cases, typical instances
							</h4>
							<p class="first-para">
								We give only a few of the many cases of this nature on record. (Aside from the following, typical instances may be found in Cases 158 and 371 on page 75 as well as in the records beginning at the bottom of page 76, and Case 1057 on page 80.)
							</p>
							<p>
								From Notebook number 33 of -----: Mr. Sadony foresaw many accidents and did, in many instances, give warning. Where the warning was heeded there was no accident, and where it was not heeded his prophecy was fulfilled. There were also many cases where the accident could not be avoided, so he gave no warning, but told his friends and in every case they observed that it came to pass.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1009 &ndash; Letter 2827a &ndash; "Do you remember the day of my visit when you were all working on the Log Cabin? You warned us all to be careful as you were afraid that someone would be cut in the ankle. Some hours later I saw one of the men's axe raised for a blow, and remembered your warning. I stepped to one side as the blade descended. The head flew off and sank three inches in the ground where my heel had been, passing directly over my footprint, through the space in the air that had been occupied by my ankle. I did not 'ask for a sign,' but it seems that this was not sufficient. Twice since coming to C., have I so nearly failed to heed your last words of warning that l have tasted of what you feared, and it was bitter. Death is kinder by far than these conditions to which you have opened my eyes. I walked among living dead men and never knew, until a heartless smile on my own face hid the hell that was their daily bread. From this you have saved me."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 110 &ndash; "Mr. Sadony made a special call at our house to warn Mr. A. to be very careful, for in a short time he would be badly hurt. Three weeks later his hand was crushed at the foundry...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 115 &ndash; In the year 1901, Mr. Sadony warned Mr. John Ahlmendinger of Chicago, not to allow his young son to go swimming at the time of the next thunderstorm. A few days later It began to rain, and the son wanted to go with thirteen other boys to swim at the pier of the water works, North Halsted and Lake Michigan. The boy started and was called back. In the meantime the other boys were getting drenched, so they went under the tin-lined pier. There was a crash of lightning and all were killed.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sometime later Mrs. A. called and Mr. Sadony told her to tell her husband not to dance at the next dance which was given in honor of Mr. C. Harrison, then Mayor of the City. He danced one dance and dropped dead.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 256 &ndash; Mr. Sadony told the Mayor of K. to warn his daughter not to ride on a bicycle on a certain date, so as to avoid a serious accident by the cars. The warning was forgotten, and she was killed by the electric street car at Racine.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. S. had told Mr. I. that he was to have the greatest surprise of his life &ndash; which came to pass when he picked up his own daughter, right after she had been killed. He did not know who it was until he saw her face.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 289 &ndash; A certain leader of ballet dances in a well known theatrical company came to Mr. Sadony in Chicago. He warned her not to dance more than a year longer, and to report to him once a month, which she did for ten months. Then three months after that she wrote, saying that she could not keep her promise to give up dancing. One month later she was dead from an injury to her spine.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. C. A. tells the following:
							</p>
							<p>
								In the summer of 1913 K.J., C.A., U.S., P.S., Mr. Sadony and myself went up the river on a fishing trip. Mr. Sadony appeared to dread to go. He turned back three times, and even went so far as to dispatch a carrier pigeon (one of two which we carried), saying that we would leave for home in fifteen minutes. This was before we had reached the camping place. The boys all begged him to go on, so we finally reached camp. When we arrived, Mr. Sadony told us all to be careful, as he was still nervous. One of the boys had a bottle of whiskey which he asked him to give him in case of accident. In landing I had dropped my gun in the water. As I remember it, two of the other boys had dropped their guns in the mud or on land. However Mr. Sadony told each of us to look into the barrel of his gun. Fifteen minutes later I held my gun at arms length in one hand and did not grasp the barrel with the other, remembering the warning. But I did neglect to look into the barrel, although I had drained it. I pulled the trigger. The barrel burst, tearing off the thumb of my other hand which I held as far as possible from the gun. A piece of steel, nearly a foot long, knocked off the hat of Mr. U.S. Mr. Sadony immediately poured whiskey over the wound, and sent the other carrier pigeon with a note to have a doctor ready for an operation. The doctor was waiting, but I lost my thumb above the first knuckle. I no longer doubted the advisability of taking seriously any nervousness on the part of Mr. Sadony."
							</p>
							<p>
								From Notebook number 33 of -----:
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony with his family and a few friends drove around the lake past a point where he imagined seeing the fence all turn down, and a car go down the steep embankment. He spoke of this to his family and his friends. This was Monday evening. Tuesday evening, they drove by the same point. The fence was broken through. A Ford had gone down the embankment. From among the pieces at the bottom, his son brought home the rim of one of the lights, as a silent witness.
							</p>
							<p>
								It happened many times, that Joseph avoided accidents himself. He would refuse to travel on a certain road on a certain day, saying that there was to be an accident, and he did not wish it to be a car full of his loved ones, and himself responsible at the wheel.
							</p>
							<p>
								He would say, "We will watch now as we pass tomorrow, and see evidence of the poor blind careless mortal that does not use the power God has given us all. We may pity him, but he is reaping as he sowed. God is wise and good and just. The law of compensation does not err. We may say, 'It might have been us.' It might have been anyone. But was it? Were we not protected? All the world save that one could say, 'It might have been us.' And if so, would God then have been wise and good and just?"

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="masters">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4>
								Masters
							</h4>

							<p>
								"Masters rule their own destiny by thought or understanding, while the masses are ruled by environments or heredity," Mr. Sadony would explain.
							</p>
							<p>
								If we wish to be masters we must create a law unto ourselves, hew out a path of undeviating purpose. At the first unconscious step from this path, there tolls the death-knell of a lost soul. To waver at the influence of another, of circumstances, of environments, is to step into the path of this other, and be subject to its self-created laws for better or for worse.
							</p>
							<p>
								These things are so subtle and so many sided that it is not only foolish and useless, but impossible to analyze them with the human mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								Enough that we did not go. Vastly more than enough that we saw next day the wreckage of a horrible triple accident on the road in question. We did not ask or need such proof. And this happened not once, but countless times. Often Mr. Sadony would ask friends to tell him what had occurred at certain points, then pre-sensing of which made him apprehensive not for himself, but for his loved ones and his friends, whom he endeavored always to protect from taking that first unconscious step from their own path into that of another, and thereby into danger not their own....
							</p>
							<p>
								And always they would find it as he had said, and would tell of this accident or that narrow escape which they themselves had experienced.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1056 &ndash; Mr. Sadony foresaw an accident to himself on a winter day when the ruts of ice were deep and it was necessary to drive to another town in his car. He spoke of seeing himself in a ditch by the side of the road, with a heavy-laden truck thundering by, two wheels of which had been in the same rut as the left two wheels of his own car, neither of them able to climb out of the icy rut.
							</p>
							<p>
								It happened quickly and surprisingly in this wise. A large many-seated bus filled with people swerved around a bend, and toward us in one of the same ruts. Mr. Sadony tried to turn out, but failed. Then he put on the brakes, and swung the wheels violently so that he threw his car out of the track and we slid easily, safely down an icy incline into the ditch without tipping over, and the heavy bus, which had indeed been built out of a "truck", and was "heavily laden", tore by above. The prophecy was fulfilled. We were in the ditch. But an accident was avoided by Mr. Sadony's quickness to fulfill his part of the prophecy just enough in advance to avoid the "simultaneous" fulfillment that would have been a "collision."

							<h4>
								Man is a Barometer
							</h4>
							<p>
								There are many cases that indicate Man to be a "barometer", recording exterior conditions; even though not aware of the fact. The following are three of the many instances that Mr. Sadony, himself, has told.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 554 &ndash; I received a letter with request for advice. As I started to answer it I felt sort of dizzy, so I laid it aside. Next day I tried again, with the same result. A few days later I determined to finish, and did so, but it seemed with a queer dread. Afterward I learned that it was written by an insane woman. It seemed rather strange. Was I mentally in her environments? Did my subconscious mind sense her condition, interpreting it to my objective mind? Or was it a 'sixth sense' interpreting by 'psychometry' the magnetism of the letter."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 556 &ndash; "One summer, while writing letters, I began to muse, 'Suppose my best horse should break his leg. Would I have to shoot him? &ndash; or could I put him in splints.' I became nervous and sent Miss S. and Mr. A. out to see if everything was all right. They did not return, so in half an hour I went after them, finding that Andy, my best horse, had his right front leg over the manger with the tie-chain around it so that Mr. A. could not get it loose without cutting the halter. The scars of the links could be seen for a long while.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Was this the vibration of the horse's mind?"
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 1063 &ndash; Clippings were found of twenty-two years ago, telling of how Mr. Sadony had been impelled to a certain spot just in time to save a man from drowning. Upon being asked about the occasion, Mr. S. replied, "I felt a strong desire to go up the river three miles, with no other reason, apparently, than to see how a certain bank looked and how much the current had washed it away since the time when I used to swim there. I was so anxious that I could hardly wait to get started. As I approached I saw a man running along the bank. When I arrived and looked over the water, I saw an arm disappearing. I threw off my coat, took a dive, and reached him in time. When I had brought him to shore I felt satisfied that this was the mission that had forced me to go up the river at just that time." Can this be explained? (The rescued man proved to be one of the staff of a local paper, a Mr. Hall.)

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="truth-comes">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4>
								Truth Comes
							</h4>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony permits truth to come to him, crystalizing in its own shape. He then tries to figure out what the shape is. Whereas most of us shape things to suit ourselves, according to past acquirement.
							</p>
							<p>
								Often he would advise a man in terms of symbols which he, himself, did not understand, while the man to whom he talked, recognized the meaning instantly.
							</p>
							<p>
								On one occasion, while talking with a certain man, he seemed to see the symbol of a silver frog in connection with his name. It was indistinct and fragmentary. He could not himself interpret or apply this. However, it was later discovered that the middle two of his four names meant originally a silver-smith and a tadpole.
							</p>
							<p>
								Case 612, (page 76) is an example of the application of this principle. Mr. Sadony has often explained:
							</p>
							<p>
								"I use symbols in prevision because those things have not yet occurred, and are consequently not in my memory for comparison. Symbols therefore, in such a case, may be interpreted as 'Causes' rather than 'Effects' (or records)."
							</p>
							<p>
								Of section VII, a study of "Mechanical Intuition", with an account of experiences, would fill a good sized volume, and will not be considered in this booklet. Of "sensing the whereabouts of inanimate objects", Mr. Sadony has often said:
							</p>
							<p>
								"In reference to finding lost articles, I am never interested in the subject. Enough that we find and take care of what we possess. If harmony is lost, I am on the job."
							</p>
							<p>
								The subject of "Clairvoyance", and "Unconscious Preparation", will also be dealt with in another booklet, as they involve an account of cases that are too numerous to mention here.

							<h4>
								Prophecy &ndash; many cases
							</h4>
							<p>
								The following are quoted from a selection of typical cases illustrating the general subject of Prophecy:
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 317-19 &ndash; A friend writes, "For three years Mr. Sadony predicted every working order that came to the Iron works. He told the foreman of the company of these two months in advance...."He predicted Mrs. B's death, and the divorce of V., as well as his remarriage.
							</p>
							<p>
								"He warned Mr. C.S's father that he had better examine the straps to his wooden leg. Mr. S. replied, 'Oh, that's all right. No danger.' But he went fishing. The strap broke, and he used all his fish lines to fasten on his leg so that he could walk home.
							</p>
							<p>
								"And I remember of another case, of some time ago. Perhaps you have forgotten. There was a man and his wife and daughter, whom Mr. Sadony warned to exchange their theater tickets. The father could not go to the performance the next day, but the mother and daughter went, and were burned to death in the Iroquois Fire...." <sup>[1]</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. Iroquois Theater Fire, December 30, 1903, causing 600+ deaths. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_Theatre_fire">Wikipedia</a></sup>&nbsp;]
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 172 &ndash; "Last summer you predicted my mother's illness, (she was operated on Oct. 26); my present position, (I came on to N.Y., about Sept. 1st, and opened the same day); someone making a proposition for extra work, (a couple of weeks ago); and many minor details which I just can't recall at the moment...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 325 &ndash; "Mr M., proprietor of the K. House, and four friends were with Mr. Sadony when he heard a step in the hall. Mr. Sadony stated that he suddenly felt a pain in his right knee. He asked Mr. C. to see who had passed. It proved to be Mrs. P., the proprietor's sister, (fifty years of age). While Mr. C. was speaking to her, Mr. Sadony told the rest that the lady who had passed, suffered with pain in her knee, but that it would not bother her any more. Mrs. P. told Mr. C. that as she passed the door she thought, 'I believe Mr. Sadony could cure me.' She had planned a trip to Mount Clemens for treatment. From that moment, however, she ceased feeling the pain. Mr. Sadony felt the pain for three days."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 270 &ndash; And Mr. S. told a certain young man and young woman that they would be married in one year, but that they had better make sure that they were congenially mated or they would disagree in three years. In two, they would have a little boy. They married as prophesied. The little boy came. At the end of three years they were divorced.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 146 &ndash; "Last Spring I received a letter from you, which at the time seemed very confusing. Since then it has all become quite clear.... Perhaps you don't remember. It would be quite impossible, with all your correspondence. It was just advice in reference to some people...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Another letter: "Five years ago, on my first visit to you, you spoke of a man who was going to be a great help to me. You foretold my travels abroad. It was all very true." (V.B.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 254 &ndash; "On the first of February, 1906, Prof. Sadony told me that in a year and eleven months I would have a baby girl with blue eyes and black hair. Really, the baby was born exactly in a year and eleven months, on January first, 1908.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Then he told me that around June 20th, while going on a trip to Europe, my little girl would be sick, but that I should not worry over it because she would be all right again in a few days. I had forgotten this while away, until she was taken suddenly ill one night, and then it all came back to me. The date was June 21st." (Mrs. M.J.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 258 &ndash; Letter 2714 &ndash; "I have been simply amazed at times when I found that events which you prophesied concerning me came to pass, although I assure you I did nothing purposely to help bring the fulfillment about."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 152 &ndash; Letter 1089 &ndash; "Your predictions to myself and family have come to pass. First for my dear mother, you predicted that in the year 1914 she would suffer the loss of three loved ones. Correct." (Remainder omitted.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 305 &ndash; Letter 4071 &ndash; To Miss M. speaking of her mother not being well: "To me it appears as if there were something in the way of the blood or nerve impulse either at the base of the brain, the cerebellum, or in the convolutions back of the ear..." A letter came later telling of an operation which had proved necessary to relieve congestion in one of the sinuses.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 587 &ndash; "For some time previous to the death of George M. Sr., the large iron safe in this office had not been locked (that is, not thoroughly locked, with the tumblers being thrown over.) It was customary just to close the safe and give the combination a slight turn on the dial.
							</p>
							<p>
								"One night, G.M. Jr. accidentally closed and locked the safe. Mr. M. Sr. was the only one who knew the combination and as his personal papers pertaining to the estate were in the safe (He being dead), it was necessary that it be opened.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Being office manager and acting secretary, I made every effort to open the safe, but without results. As a last resort before breaking the lock, I requested you to try to open it. You agreed, and knowing that Mr. M. was the only one who knew the combination, you took off your hat and coat, and requested that you be blindfolded. You took your place at the desk over the open ledger (as if you were Mr. M.) You previously had requested me to ask you suddenly, at a certain time, to open the safe. This I did. Whereupon you turned to the safe, and to my astonishment opened it in about ten seconds."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 109 &ndash; A Dr. A. came to Mr. Sadony with a Mrs. R. (of Evanston). He advised Mrs. R. (who asked about her husband), to take him out in the country for a rest, saying that if she did not, he would become insane. A year afterwards he became insane. She came again, and Mr. S. told her that he could be cured in seven months, but to take him out at once, or it would be too late. This was disregarded, and he became a raving maniac.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 204 &ndash; Letter 1764 &ndash; "My boy is in F. He was married the 11th of Sept. in Canada. He is coming home Sunday. I am getting my divorce the 16th of January.... Everything so far you have told me has come just as you said...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 664 &ndash; One dark night, I drove to town with Mr. Sadony, behind a very nervous horse. As we reached the township line, Mr. S. became very nervous and asked me to get out and examine all the wheels. I said that I had done so before leaving, so we rode on for perhaps half a mile. At this point, Mr. Sadony repeated the expression of his nervousness, made the remark that he did not like to risk it any longer, and ended by making the assertion that as soon as we reached Dowie's gate, he would get out and see what could be the matter. At Dowie's gate he jumped out of the buggy. As soon as he took hold of the thill, it fell out of his hand. The bolt was on the ground a few feet away, in the rear.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 686 &ndash; Mr. Ch--- of Shelby, telephoned long distance, to ask if Mr. Sadony could give any information as to the location of the drowned bodies of his son and a companion. Mr. S. replied that it appeared to him as if only one boy had drowned, and requested that Mr. C--- come to see him personally, which he did. In the course of the interview, Mr. Sadony drew a diagram of the point where the body would be cast up by the first west winds. As he described his method of doing this, he imagined himself a bird flying by, looking down from way up, at what he imagined to be a body that he could discern at a certain point. The place marked on the diagram was to be six miles north of the place where the boy was drowned.

								The body of the Ch--- boy's companion was found, and examination proved that he had died of heart disease, verifying Mr. Sadony's belief that only one boy had drowned. The Ch--- boy was found about a week later a few hundred feet from the spot that had been designated.
							</p>
							<p>
								A letter dated June 23, 1916, reads in part, "am surprised that the Boys had not called you on the phone at the time of the finding. Yes the first west wind that came did the work. Again yes, your diagram was a little further North than the body was found, but such that the current could have moved the body...."

								CASE 687 &ndash; "Five or six years ago," said one witness, "Geo. --- Sr. asked Mr. Sadony for advice. He told him that if he did not take a rest within three weeks, he would never get out of bed after that. Mr. --- remained at work, was taken sick, and was then taken to the Muskegon Hospital. Mr. Sadony was notified one morning that if he didn't come to see him before noon, he would not be able to see him alive. It was impossible for him to get there in the morning as it was past train time. He said, 'G. --- shall live till I see him. He can not die. He shall not die.' There was great emphasis and determination in his words. In the afternoon, Mr. C. and I accompanied Mr. Sadony to Muskegon, arriving there about 3:45. He took Mr. Sadony's hand, who seemed to look past us, and said, 'I can go now that you have come.'"
							</p>
							<p>
								Previous to this, while Mr. --- was still ill at the hospital, Mr. Christian was staying at his home. Mr. C. became nervous one day and asked Mr. Sadony to stay with him. Mr. Sadony accompanied him, and as they passed into the parlor said, "Clarence, listen to this peculiar music that comes to my mind", whereupon he sat at the piano and improvised what he seemed to hear mentally. The music was very sad and affecting. So much so, Mr. C. tells, that Mr. Sadony's eyes were filled with tears. "So help me God, Clarence," he said, upon finishing. "I see a coffin and the remains of G---, and the piece that I played was a funeral march."
							</p>
							<p>
								"A few days later," said Mr. Sadony, upon being questioned with regard to the occasion, "I attended the funeral and saw the coffin just as it had appeared to me."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 688 &ndash; One Spring Mr. Sadony predicted to a party of fifteen or more, that there would be five deaths from drowning in White Lake; first two and then three. Dr. Montgomery and a lady were drowned as the summer was drawing to a close. The Captain of the Life Saving Station, having faith in the prediction, put on a double guard. Later Mr. Sadony attended a birthday party at the home of A. Mr. H. had promised to come there to meet him for the first time, but that night he was called out on duty as Deputy Sheriff. He had been nervous, however, and made the statement that he would much rather have met Mr. Sadony. He was accompanied upon his duties by two other men. About twelve-thirty Mr. Sadony went to the graphaphone and played "Nearer My God to Thee." For some unaccountable reason he appeared to feel very sad. It was seldom that he revealed this. It was nearing two A.M., when they left for home. As he passed along the shore of White Lake, he noticed that the water was rough, and said to Mrs. Sadony, "Suppose two or even three men should hang on a boat out there: God help them."
							</p>
							<p>
								The incident was forgotten, but next morning the bodies of the three men were found, Mr. J.H. and the two who had accompanied him on his duties.
							</p>
							<p>
								A week later, while putting up a stove pipe, a strong thought came to Mr. Sadony, so he wrote it down on a slip of paper to study it afterward. The words that came to him were, "Fanny, I was not murdered. It was an accident. Be happy. Someone will take my place in four years." It was signed "Joe." At the time Mr. Sadony did not recognize the meaning, so he placed it on file. Two months later, Mrs. A. brought a visitor to his home, and introduced her as Mrs. Nanny H. Instantly Mr. Sadony went to his file, brought the slip of paper, and told her of the strange thought that he had received. Mrs. H. cried, and swore that she would never marry. However, Mr. Sadony repeated that she would, and that the man would have the same name, "Joe." Four years later she met him on the street in another city and told him that she had married a man named "Joe", and was very happy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Later still, (March 2, 1915) she wrote, "in thinking over what you told me, I particularly remember one statement. That was, that in about five years I would be happier than I could think I would ever be again. And that I would be comfortably situated and well taken care of. You described my disposition very accurately and told me many instances relative to my past life very correctly...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 351 &ndash; Letter 5450 &ndash; "Contrary to your dope, I expect to move my offices tomorrow to 91 G. street...." Later, Letter 5451 &ndash; "You were right. I did not move my office junk on Monday..."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 650 &ndash; "... It's just as L. says, she is usually just on the point of writing you when she hears before the letter is even posted.... By the way, I made a mistake, in sending you the wrong handwriting to read last time, (saying it was Mr. B's) but I thought it so wonderful because you described Mr. O., the other man in our section, to a nicety, and hit upon facts which I appreciate very much."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 363 &ndash; Letter 5709 &ndash; "Prior to about October, 1910, I had no acquaintance with you. In that month I was at your place. At that time you assumed to see my past and future. At that time you informed me that Mrs. R., my first wife, had departed this life about Feb. 3rd of that year, which was true. You also informed me that I would marry a young wife from California; which I later did. You also informed me that you would first meet Mrs. R. on a train, which was true...." &ndash; Judge R.
							</p>
							<p>
								(NOTE: Mr. Sadony predicted Judge R's death, which occurred in 1924.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 364 &ndash; Letter 5710 &ndash; "... You told S. of his misfortune in the lumber business, that he would realize his life's ambition, to receive the appointment of an U.S. Judgeship &ndash; an office he had sought, and for which I had strained every energy to bring him. He abandoned hope. Time revealed the fact that the judgeship did come to him, and in the year you said it would.... You told Mrs. S. that she had left her jewelry at home and placed some in a certain drawer before her departure. You spoke of five rings. She insisted that there were only four. On her return she wrote to my wife, admitting her error, saying she had placed an old ring in the box given her by her mother. She did not wear it, but it made the five..."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 145 &ndash; Letter 1003 &ndash; ".... As far as I the long Journey, two large deals being offered me, and my turning down one of them is concerned, that has all come true. The accepting or turning down of the second one is undecided yet, but will be decided very soon... I have thought of writing you a good many times on the subject, but as you declined to accept remuneration for your services, I have hesitated in doing so...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Letter 1004 &ndash; (five years later) &ndash; "About five years ago last summer you, in conversation with my daughter, told her that within six weeks, a near relative on her Mother's side would pass away, and described the condition of her grandmother on her mother's side, giving exact description of her sufferings, but at the time you made these statements, none of the family had any idea that she would pass away for many months. Yet just four weeks from the time you made the prediction, Mrs. W. passed away. I am sure you had no knowledge that such a person lived, at the time you foretold her death...." (James Bayne, Pres. &amp; Gen. Mgr., The James Bayne Company, Grand Rapids, Mich.)
							</p>
							<p>
								(NOTE: Nine years later, in the fall of 1924, Mr. Sadony wrote to Mr. B., stating to a friend, "It is the last time I shall write him. It is his 'Death Letter' from me." A few weeks later, in November, and upon the day that the above portion of this manuscript was being prepared, Mr. Bayne passed away.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 165 &ndash; Letter 1198 &ndash; "You asked about my finger and stated that on July 3rd, 4th and 9th it worried you, as if you had a pain of your own. You say it was funny but simply could not account for it. Well, when I tell you that I was stretched out on an operating table about four-thirty Saturday afternoon, July 3rd, and my finger was laid wide open, you sure will smile...." (Mr. L.R.C.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 176 &ndash; Letter 1416 &ndash; "You told me about myself that it seemed to you that some time in the past there had been a division of property in our family of which I had not received all I was entitled to. That is right. The division took place in Denmark, and I had never mentioned it to anybody where you could have obtained any information about it.
							</p>
							<p>
								"You told Mrs. B. at our house, when she was worrying about her boy who had gone to parts unknown, that she would get a letter from him a few days before Christmas, as she did...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony explained about this matter, "I imagined I was her son, and then told her that I saw my sister in Chicago, and then left for the north. I then told her that I would try an experiment to make him write her a letter for Christmas. Before Christmas the letter arrived from Wisconsin. He was compelled to write. Why? Those are things that axe hard to explain...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 214 &ndash; Letter 1954 &ndash; "August 7 you predicted my husband would change his will before the end of that year, and to my advantage. It came true on Dec. 19th. You also said that he would meet with an accident about the same time, which came true too. He almost lost his right foot. You advised me to drop a certain friend, as she was a foe. It certainly was true. The death of my husband's mother came true the very month that you said, and sickness and disturbance at my home in Switzerland. Some of my friends lost a dear one through death and circumstances changed entirely...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 232 &ndash; Letter 2206 &ndash; "Sixteen years ago you predicted three things to me that came true. One was that I would meet a man and go to Kansas City with him. Second that I was to go to Denver, Colorado. Third, you warned me that X was no friend of mine. Right you were...." (H.W.K.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 264 &ndash; Letter 2810 &ndash; "A phone call this morning gave me the news that the 'blow had fallen'. They are going to break him if possible.... Prior to this it has been very quiet, and he felt it might blow over. But .... yesterday .... came in and served papers on him. They tied up his bank accounts, put a lease on his home and automobiles.... Now it gees to court.... I wanted you to know, for I remember you predicted this."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 320 &ndash; Latter 5137 &ndash; "About four years ago, before I was married, you told me that I would be married inside of two years. This was true. You also said I would not marry the girl with whom I was keeping company. This was also true. You said that I had met my future wife. This I did not know at the time, but I had met her as you said. You also said that in the near future I would be employed by a firm that had already worked for. This was true. Also that I would buy some property, which I did. Then you told my wife that upon a certain date, there would be a business transaction that would bring money. This was true, to the exact date given her about six months before this transaction.... etc."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 327 &ndash; Letter 5171 &ndash; "You told me if I didn't see my uncle I wouldn't get to see him. He died within a month from that time...." Another letter. "He was sick only five days. I am so glad I took your advice and came here, or I would never have seen him."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 335 &ndash; Letter 5260 &ndash; "I met the little gray-haired man you told me I would come in contact with unexpectedly. I met him on the boat coming home."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 406 &ndash; One afternoon Mr. Sadony was impressed to wire Mr. U.S. of the K. Hotel, to telephone his wife not to take the medicine she was about to take. He did so, and found that she had the bottle in her hand to take the medicine, set it down to answer the phone, and upon examining it, found that the bottle contained poison.
							</p>
							<p>
								Upon another occasion Mr. Sadony wrote, "Now tell me what is the matter at your home. Is your wife or wife's niece sick?... It worries me, and I would advise you to be careful." The reply stated, "My wife is sick and we are going to have the doctor in a few days so they can operate on her." (Letter 6533)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 420 &ndash; Letter 6704 &ndash; ".... One thing which most emphatically came out as you said, was that I would be backed in my new venture by two people, one who could talk, and one with money. Sure enough, the one who could talk, after a conversation with me, went to the one with the money, and I received a certain amount of backing.... If your predictions did nothing else, they put the right kind of punch in a pretty groggy individual, and helped a whole lot...." (W.S.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 421 &ndash; Letter 6729 &ndash; "You foretold the marriage of our daughter to B.A.D., who was at that time calling upon her, but we had never thought she cared especially for him, nor he for her. Both were so young. To our surprise they skipped to the Church, only a stone's throw from our house, and were married April 6th, 1913. This, I consider a most remarkable prophecy, .... You told my wife that her father, (then in frail health) would live longer than her mother. Her mother was buried Christmas Eve of the following year, and her father will come to visit us next week.
							</p>
							<p>
								"You will remember a robust, red-faced, philosophical sceptic, named ---. Well, he may be sceptical yet, but within a month after you left, what you saw for him materialized. You told him he had a man associated with him that would stand watching, and that he stood a good chance of having trouble and might lose something if not careful.... Now this Mr. --- was a traveling salesman, and he had a sub-agent, but he thought him straight. He was soon failing to get satisfactory reports, however, and found that the fellow had pawned a valuable diamond ring, using about $300.00 of the Company's money to redeem it...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 436 &ndash; Letter 7190 &ndash; "You will remember telling me at H. that I would hear from my son in Feb. (that he was still alive.) Well, I did...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 474 &ndash; Letter 7928 &ndash; "The most important predictions in my case are two. In March, I traded my farm for a house and lot. After signing the contract I found I was getting the worst of the deal. In speaking of the matter to you, you said there was a third party in the case who did not care to trade, and advised me to see this party, and between us we could agree to call the deal off. This matter turned out as you predicted. I desired a political position in this town. I wrote you about it, and you advised me not to run as my health would not permit it. A little later I was taken down with congested lungs, and was sick at the time of election...." (W.J.W.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 482 &ndash; Letter 9406 &ndash; "I have had very great mental trouble since the commencement of this year. One day, while looking into my papers, your letters came to hand, and on perusing them over again, I was struck by your prophetic insight into coming events in my life, which cast their shadows not before me, but before your mind's eye." (Details of case omitted.) &ndash; Banabihari Patit, Pleader, Cuttack, Orissa, India.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 588 &ndash; "I was much worried over my son, Clarence, who was then living in Pittsburgh, Pa. Not having heard from him, I was advised to call upon you for advice.... You told me that I would see my son shortly, and that he would have a lady with him. Of course I could not reconcile this statement with my knowledge of how sick he had been. But the next morning who should walk into my room but my son, with a lady who was a perfect stranger to me."
