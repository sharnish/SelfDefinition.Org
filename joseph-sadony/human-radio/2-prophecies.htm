							<h4>
								Introduction
							</h4>
							<p class="center note80">
								(The next 3 pargraphs are the words of the compiler.)
							</p>
							<p>
								The materials of prophecy are limited, as with numbers from the nine digits of which infinite combinations may be obtained. Hundreds of cases might contain similar predictions without two being alike, for the combination, circumstances and individuals differ. It is the spirit of prophecy which is unlimited. Details are but the letters of the alphabet that names the human family. The names are but words that group themselves into paragraphs portraying a symbol. Paragraphs form chapters of history. What matters is the book complete. Opposite to each page of closely packed fine print, there is a large picture that tells it all at a glance. Science, with bent head and strained eyes, reads and analyzes each word of the print. The spirit of prophecy turns the pages leisurely. It tells the story that is already written, by describing pictures which children understand.
							</p>
							<p>
								The elements applying to any subject are few. Aside form special phases that we will not consider here, the interests of an average human being may be found, for instance, in Birth, Movement, Marriage, Offspring, Condition, Relation and Death. Birth and offspring might be combined. Of birth might be told the time, sex and nature; of death, the nature and time. In movement is included change (of environments, states of being, thought, emotions, plans...). Marriage includes divorce. Condition, finance, health, etc. Relation includes meetings, as well as implying proposals, offers, propositions, transactions. And through all runs the matter of "date", which is the least certain of all, being a matter of estimate. We see a house. We judge it to be so far away. We may exaggerate according to our interest. But the house exists. If we will continue to walk we will reach it. If we run we find it the sooner. It has been said that there are some things the human mind can never know. But, there are no "letters" missing in the alphabet that Mr. Sadony has used to describe this picture.
							</p>
							<p>
								We quote briefly from a few. The evidence is overwhelming that the human mind may determine these things without the uncertainty of "guess-work", "coincidence", "chance."

							<h4>
								Of Birth
							</h4>
							<p>
								CASE 465 &ndash; Letter 7841 &ndash; "I particularly wanted to tell you of the fulfillment of your prophecy that the next addition to the W. family would be a boy. You may or may not remember that you told me I need worry about this no further, but that the boy was regularly scheduled, and would arrive in due course...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 606 &ndash; "Will write and tell you we have that new girl you told me of at Lone Lodge. Came Saturday morning, weighs 7.5 lbs...." (J. H.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 231 &ndash; When quite young Mr. Sadony made a prediction to a Mr. W. H..., that in one year and two months he would be the father of a little boy. It came to pass on the exact date. He also predicted that Mr. H. would be divorced three years later, which came to pass. A letter from Mr. H. of years later, reads, "Maybe you will also remember what you told us about a commotion in our house between the tenth of January and the fourth of February. Well, we had it. My wife was very sick and wasn't expected to live from the first to the fourth of Feb. Those three days she wasn't expected to live at all, but she was very sick for over four weeks &ndash; part of the time unconscious. I myself was sick from the 18th to 28th of January and my little boy was also just as sick as his mother, they both having pneumonia...."

							<h4>
								Of Death
							</h4>
							<p>
								CASE 350 &ndash; "We did have sad news from home. My little brother's death we did receive." It had not been stated that the sad news would be a death. Mr. Sadony wrote, "I dread to tell things of unhappiness before they come, but always try to impress the time, to prove that I felt the truth...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 563 &ndash; (From an editorial of the Morning Sentinel.) "Sunday noon, August 16th, Mr. Sadony.... prophesied the death of Mr. D.M. Miller to W.A--- of this city. This is only one of a great many prophecies which have come to pass since his coming to this city...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 565 &ndash; "Mr. Sadony predicted the death of Mr. C. Christians even to the detail of his dying with a rose in his hand. The last persons to see him remarked that he picked up a rose which he held as he passed away."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 582 &ndash; (With regard to the business affairs of a Mr. C., and a change and climax to come in 1921.) ".... You were very much correct, as a part of the firm did pass away the 16th of March."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 607 &ndash; "Yes, you were indeed right about the three men drowning in White Lake. And also when you said that Dr. H's friend would be dead when he reached Chicago. At the time, we were staying at the Beach. Do you remember telling me that we would lose two more distant relatives before the year expired, which also came to pass...." (Mrs. H.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 648 &ndash; "You also told me that someone was going to die, and I would hear about it. I did. That one was his father, and they sent me a wire...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 540 &ndash; A clipping was found which read: "Antiquarian dies reading an Ancient Tome." It was remembered that Mr. Sadony had predicted the death of Julius Doerner, who, as explained in the item, was "conspicuous for years as a bibliophile and antiquarian." Mr. K.J. of Chicago was written for details. He replied, "The prediction of Mr. Doerner's death was about six weeks before his passing out. I visited the Valley and spoke to Mr. Sadony about two oil paintings I had consigned to Mr. Doerner to sell for me. In the course of the conversation about the paintings, he advised me to take them out of his place before his death, as he had only a short time to live."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 473 &ndash; Letter 7914 &ndash; "Your prediction concerning father's death was quite correct. As you said, he had a cancer and would live about ten days longer. He died of cancer of the stomach eleven days later, December 22nd." (C. Weissmann.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 178 &ndash; "While visiting E. Rogers at C., in the fall of 1913, Mr. Sadony met Dr. D. and told him that his brother who had just left, would die in three weeks, and that Dr. D., himself, would take charge of his brother's sanitarium at Rochester. Three weeks later the brother died. Dr. D. went there, and is now in charge of the sanitarium."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 638 &ndash; (From a diary of a friend.) Name: C.P. 1-10-18, Prediction: Daughter will be ill twice, and die with her third sickness. Her baby will not live.
							</p>
							<p>
								1-24-18, Baby is in Hospital.
							</p>
							<p>
								1-27-18, Baby died.

							<h4>
								Death &ndash; Cont.</h4>
							<p>
								"There are several ways of discerning the approach of death," Mr. Sadony once explained, "sometimes when death is to take place within a few months, I unconsciously become passive for a second, then there appears to me a mental vision. It is as if I saw an angel in black at the bedside, and in my imagination all seems to be transparent. When I see this, death is sure to come. I would forfeit my life if it failed when the hand and wrist of this figure appears opaque as if ready to be led out. Another sign of death comes to me when shaking hands with a stranger. I sometimes feel a cold feeling, as if a cold draught were passing through my hands and veins. By this I know that death is near, but must use other methods to ascertain the time."
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony tells of an instance: (Case 1064), "In 1914 Mrs. Daily of Montague, eighty years old, came to visit me with her daughter, Mrs. J.A. I took her to my Study. She did not wish to leave. She cried bitterly and said, "May I come here when I am dead?" I comforted her and told her that she would be welcome. Later on, one evening in September, I remained in my office until late. At three-thirty. A.M., I went down for lunch, and then returned. When about to enter, I felt a sort of fear or dread, and waited at the door about five minutes. When I entered my thoughts turned to Mrs. Daily, and immediately I felt that cold draught of air through my body. This was about four o'clock. At nine Mrs. J.A. telephoned to say that Mrs. Daily had died at four that morning. Was this the influence of a disembodied mind, &ndash; or auto-suggestion?"

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="troubles">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4>
								Troubles, Offers, Change
							</h4>
							<p>
								Of Troubles as well, are there many instances, as In Case 162 &ndash; "The troubles you told me would come are coming thick and fast.... The battle will be a hard one for awhile, and only today a woman who you told me would come in to act as a friend, called me and told me of ---. You seem to have the situation so fully in mind...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Of offers, case 285 is typical, and it would be useless to quote from the hundreds of others. Letter 3290 &ndash; "You stated that some offers would be made by my firm. As yet I've not heard from them with reference to it, though I did receive one very soon, a few days afterward, from a firm that had made one several times before, and which I threw into the wastebasket as you said I would do...." Letter 3294 &ndash; ".... But let me tell you that the two offers you spoke of came in a most pronounced and distinct manner. It was a matter of choosing either, or, and set me to do some serious thinking."
							</p>
							<p>
								Of Change, Case 621, for example. ".... You said that I would make a change. This change seems to have taken place inasmuch as I am writing you from the city of D. instead of M...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 626 &ndash; "You told me that a condition which existed at that time, and to which I very much objected, would be changed for me, and I am happy to report that the change came just as you said it would...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 627 &ndash; "In reference to Columbia University, I fear you will change your mind before June, even were I to tell you to take a course. You will take several trips of interest that will change all your plans."
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: (Months later.) "The suggestion you offered about Columbia University came out as you foretold."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 293 &ndash; Letter 3422 &ndash; "Sometime ago I wrote you for information, and you told the conditions would change for me before Oct. 12th.... This change occurred to me about the 16th of October."

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="dates">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4>
								Of Dates to Note
							</h4>
							<p>
								Of Dates to note, Mr. Sadony was as a rule very accurate in his estimation. Case 203 is typical of many. Letter 1751 &ndash; "Mr. X. is a very sick man.... He has been near death's door three times, and this is one of them. Complications have set in. His stomach and worry have caused much of the trouble. You have not understood each other, consequently the circumstances which have often caused you to build aircastles (which may all come true within three years). Make a note of June 11th and the 23rd, then later July 4th, 10th and 27th and note how strangely and suddenly Fate seems to play with your destiny. You must take good care of your health now, above all.... Next week you will have company which you little expect, and later a trip alone, and you will enter new fields...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Letter 1752 &ndash; You may be aware by this time that Mr. X. passed away on June 11th, the first date of which you advised me to make a note and I am too stunned to know what to do."
							</p>
							<p>
								Letter 1753 &ndash; (Two months later.) "I wonder if you have anything to tell me at this time. Your first letter to me was prophetic. On the first date you mentioned, I lost my husband, then on each succeeding date there was something to remember.... I am going on the trip alone of which you wrote me, and I hope it is in the right direction.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 261 &ndash; Letter 2752 &ndash; ".... You predicted that I would be working at a better position by January 15th of the next year, which would eventually lead to something better still. I began work here on the 13th of January.... You told me of a few things which would happen, and a few suggestions, which have come to pass.... I know you told me accurately of many of my characteristics, and showed me that mind-reading was a possibility...."
							</p>
							<p>
								From Case 311 &ndash; Letter 5106 &ndash; ".... If you remember you said that I was going to have three offers, the first to come on the 28th of January. Well, it didn't come the 28th, but it came during the week of the 28th, which I think is near enough. It certainly is remarkable how you got that.... etc."

							<h4>
								Politics
							</h4>
							<p>
								Of Presidential or political prophecies there have been few, except among Mr. Sadony's most intimate friends, as he has consistently avoided prophecy of a public nature. However, we quote the following!
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 234 &ndash; Letter 2241 &ndash; "If I remember correctly the last time I called on you was in the Spring of 1901. Many things have happened since then. One of your prophecies was made when I was operating in stocks and bonds in the year 1901, when the market depended largely on the presidential election, at which time you predicted that McKinley would be elected President of the United States. There are other things that have come to pass, the dates of which I do not remember at present...." (R.A.H., Vice Pres. &amp; Mgr. of the Garment Co., Chicago, Ill.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 381 &ndash; Letter 6038 &ndash; "When your letter came saying that the world of commerce would be satisfied with the next administration, and that it would be Republican, it looked like something in the dim distance, but suddenly it is the 'next administration!' Did you sense something of Harding's death?...." <sup>[1]</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. President Warren G. Harding died of a cardiac arrest on August 2, 1923 while still in office. He was succeeded by Calvin Coolidge, also a Republican, who won the next election, in 1924.]
							</p>
							<p>
								Later, while talking with a group of friends upon the subject of "Gaudiness" and its "hollowness," Mr. Sadony used as one of his examples the Democratic party, which he said was "gaudy" in its intentions, and would therefore lose in the next election.
