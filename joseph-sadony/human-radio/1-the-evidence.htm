							<p>
								Mr. Sadony's correspondence and experience afford absolute evidence, with hundreds of affidavits and witnesses of certain powers or possibilities of the human mind. An exhaustive study of this evidence, or anything like a systematic weaving of phenomena with theory, would fill several volumes. In a booklet we can hardly more than touch upon a few typical cases that show the nature of our omissions. These have been selected promiscuously, just as they have been found, and as they have come, to give a better understanding of "the timber to the building." They are but a few out of thousands that have been verified. It will be understood that the confidence of personal friends removes their cases from consideration. Furthermore the identity has been concealed in the majority of cases, from which it has been considered permissible to quote.
							</p>
							<p>
								The material at hand arranges itself in several main divisions which prove, respectively, the possibility, ...
							<ul class="generic-list">
								<li>I: of correct character, delineation of those unseen and previously unknown, as well as acquaintances. </li>
								<li>II: correct sensing of thoughts or conditions "between the lines" (psychometrically, intuitively, or clairvoyantly). </li>
								<li>III: Correct reading of past. </li>
								<li>IV: Correct sensing of names, facts and intelligible messages from the deceased. "Air Messages", as Mr. Sadony has called them. </li>
								<li>V: Fulfillment of prophecies. a. intuitive, b. scientific, c.&nbsp;suggestive. &nbsp;<span class="note">See: <a href="2-prophecies.htm">2-prophecies.htm</a></span></li>
								<li>VI: Warnings (and results), both positive and negative, (with ample evidence of the result of failure to follow advice).
									&nbsp;<span class="note">See: <a href="3-of-warnings.htm">3-of-warnings.htm</a></span> </li>
								<li>VII: Mechanical intuition (sensing of conditions of inanimate objects such as machines, with diagnosis and repair of troubles). In this section also has been classed a sensing of the whereabouts of inanimate objects. And, </li>
								<li>VIII: clairvoyant or clairaudient knowledge of conditions and events transpiring at the moment, but at great distances. </li>
								<li>With a IXth section to include the more subtle manifestations such as unconscious preparation with a purpose that revealed itself afterwards, perhaps months or years later. And a Xth to include all those special and more remarkable cases not found in the preceding nine divisions. </li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								No attempt has been made to adhere strictly to this classification in selecting the following examples. The average "case" in all its details contains evidence applying to as many as six of these categories. The bulk of all cases applies to section V, the "Fulfillment of Prophecies." &nbsp;<span class="note">See: <a href="2-prophecies.htm">2-prophecies.htm</a></span>

								CASE 443 &ndash; Letter 7257 &ndash; "Your deductions regarding my character, disposition, and business activity are decidedly accurate, consequently your suggestions for future possibilities have set me thinking very seriously.... Your deductions from the handwriting I enclosed describe the character of each individual exactly &ndash; you could hardly have been more correct had you know each man personally.... You perhaps will remember having told my wife at that time (a year ago) that she would gain 16 pounds in weight in August. Well, you surely told her correctly, for she weights about 23 pounds more now. (September), she is expecting an 'arrival' about four weeks from now.... I am still with the same firm, with the exception that one of the partners left and went in business for himself, just as you predicted to me some time ago...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 192 &ndash; Letter 1624 &ndash; "After receiving your letters I took inventory of myself and found that your deductions concerning my affairs and myself were far more accurate than I could have given myself. This was somewhat astonishing to me, you being a perfect stranger...."

							<p>
								CASE 170 &ndash; Letter 1267 &ndash; "You will remember that when I had the talk with you, you did not make any predictions in regard to the future, but you told me matters that had happened in the past." (NOTE: This man's life was due to end in eight or nine years. There was nothing to prophesy of note, except his death, of which Mr. S. did warn his daughter later. He did, however, predict a preliminary illness from which he would fully recover in spite of medical opinion. This came to pass. Then came his death as foreseen.)

							<h4>
								Category IV
							</h4>
							<p class="note center toowide">
								Correct sensing of names, facts and intelligible messages from the deceased.
							</p>
							<p>
								In reference to section IV, it might be explained that while writing letters, Mr. Sadony often senses names in connection with thoughts that "come to him." Our manner of accounting for this does not alter the fact. Nor is the fact of importance to Mr. Sadony except in identifying the thought with the correspondent, or as a "milestone" which assures him that he is on the right track.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 127 &ndash; "Your letter of --- was read with much interest, especially as I can verify the names you mention, my father's name is Arthur, and I have a sister who is named Charlotte. The other Dorothy probably refers to a cousin of mine. We recall an incident of 18 or 20 years ago, to which I believe you refer...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 128 &ndash; Mr. Sadony wrote, "On picking up your letter I cannot help sensing or feeling that I am in a store of some kind, where there are cookies, perhaps some groceries, ham, or preserves, and that has all come through the hard efforts of Edward, Andrew, or Ed...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: ".... In the first paragraph you sensed in some way that we had a store, and certainly nobody could ever be more surprised than I. Yes, we have had a store for many years.... My father's name is Andrew...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 166 &ndash; Mr. S. wrote, "in reading between the lines there appears much of which I would not write at the present, because I wish to be certain that these thoughts come from you. For in their trend appears the name of 'Roy', and at the same time 'Will'. What can they have to do from a mechanical point of view?"
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: Yes, my son-in-law is an inventor &ndash; has a grinder he is trying to put on the market.... My sons are all mechanical too, &ndash; work for the American Railway Express Co., and my husband works for the Cadillac Motor Co. Tell me what he is going to do... and tell me about Roy, is he well?...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 215 &ndash; The verdict you render on my question of the 'aircraft' patent was quite gratefully received. You ask, 'By the way, what had John to do with this? Or Agnes with you?' John is my father's name, and my sister's name is Agnes. Both are interested in this stock."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 248 &ndash; From Mr. Sadony's letter, ".... But tell me, what is this light or flame he looks into? For he seems to be a hard worker, which has made him nervous and unstrung. It seems almost as if he walked a path similar to Oscar, or was it David?... etc. .... he seems to take after his mother as much as Ellen (I believe) when she was a little girl...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: ".... we are in doubt of the names Oscar or David, unless it might be relatives in Norway.... Ellen, as you mentioned is a sister to his mother. They resembled one another very much. You ask what light or flame my husband looks into. He is a watch-maker by trade...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 307 may bring a smile. "Now as for Robert, I hardly know what to say as I have no relatives by that name. My father's name was Robert when he was a little boy &ndash; but he changed it to B--- later. Then, too, mother said she had an uncle whose name was Robert. These two are the only two Roberts whom I know of...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 311 &ndash; (Extract from letter 5107) "... That afternoon that we had the talk together, you said that after I got home there would be letter for me from Chicago from a heavy thick man by the name of J. John, you thought, and that at first he wouldn't have any use for me, but afterwards would get to like me, and through him I would get a good job in March. But before that you said I would have two other offers which I would take but wouldn't keep. Well, it all came to pass within a day or so from the time you predicted, except that the man's name is Jeremiah instead of John. You said I was to sail a big boat successfully, which I did; and that I was to have a little girl born to me. I've got that too...." (Capt. M.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 337 &ndash; "You have given a true description of my character.... You ask me if I know a Jennie. They used to call me Jennie until I reached the age of twelve...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 459 &ndash; (Typical of many.) "You asked if there were not four in my family. If I am counted in, yes."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 624 &ndash; A letter was received on plain paper from a stranger. "What is the peculiar lotion and perfumes that you so often handle, and peroxide of hydrogen and muriatic acid," wrote Mr. Sadony. The reply was written on a letter-head of the "Hair shop" owned by the writer.
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 662 &ndash; Mr. S. wrote, "... Then comes the thought &ndash; (omitted) &ndash; and then your thought of an Arthur L. But, realizing as you do what might be said, I would rather be silent.... (Three paragraphs of details here omitted). And here again the name of Arthur appears, and shuts off the thoughts, as it were. Surely this party lives? If so what has he to do with you? And why the secrecy of thought? At any rate I cannot quite grasp the meaning of it...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: "... I found your letter thoroughly interesting and in many ways clear and easy to understand. The Arthur L. mentioned is my husband from whom I have been entirely separated for more than --- years, and surely this explains clearly your inability to see the picture distinctly concerning him...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 752 &ndash; ".... By the way, have you ever done any work for a hardware house, or something of that sort? It appears rather vividly to me...."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Yes, my work now is in the hardware line."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 275 &ndash; ".... I cannot help sensing an elderly gentlemen, who, while at work, used a peculiar hammer and chisel, whom you take after, as well as a younger man who is named after him. The name appears to be George.... Then go back twenty-seven years, and you can no doubt remember of the times that Henry Walter passed through. Had they known what was to be, there might be a different story to tell today because of property and relation.... While of the handwriting you sent, Otto and John, I have this much to say.... (omitted)... But again as with you, the name John rings to my mind an elderly man by the same name who, like George, has worked parallel. Then comes a little woman who must have passed away somewhere near thirty years ago, but whose love and blessing surely follows her children, for her burden was a very heavy one.... Her mother used to call her Gustel, I think. At any rate the vibration of her thoughts surely must be the influence of this letter, because the same thoughts seem to be entwined in Emil and William.... And by the way, there are certain problems that might have been solved in reference to Otto and Paul. Perhaps George can explain why the chime of bells, steam and rails...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: "In reference to Otto's hand-writing, he wrote both names, Otto and John. John is his brother. Your letter was very true, especially as far as my past is concerned...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Then later, ".... Regarding the names would inform you that George is the name of father's oldest brother. Gustel (who is dead) is the grandmother of Emil, William and Paul. And Emil, William and Paul are the brothers of Otto and John."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 294 &ndash; Mr. Sadony wrote, "At the close of your letter I heard these words, 'Tell Hage' (or some peculiar name) to stick to it and not let go just at the most important time, as I did. I'll strand by him.' The name given was Howard. I could not get the first name because I was not on the alert. I simply express the thought as it came to me, but in fear it was a delusion I asked if your father's name was Howard." (Reference to previous letter in which he spoke of the name without giving reason.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: "Your letter of ---- is a remarkably true statement of myself as I know myself honestly to be.... in regard to the message, I wonder if this is not my father speaking? For this name 'Hage' might be Hugh, my first name, and my father was known by the name of F. Howard for forty years of his life. And it is a fact that dad quit the show business at the height of his career when he should have stayed with the only business he knew. My brother and I have been thinking of getting out of the show business.... I wonder if he (father) meant us to stick to the show business by this message?"
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 412 &ndash; "While I was dictating the first part of your letter, this sort of mental message seemed to take effect in my mind, which is the case in four letters out of ten of all I write...." (Long message followed.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: "The message enclosed must belong to us by the names mentioned. My mother's name is Bessie, to whom it was addressed, and my father's name was G--- (by whom it was signed,) and the names E--- and G--- belong to my sister and myself. It is all very strange."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 471 &ndash; "I cannot help receiving strange thoughts. Whether they come from your letter or from thoughts in the air. I shall state them as they are." &ndash; Message followed with reference to "Chris", "Emma", and "Elizabeth or Lizzie, Lezzett, or Lisette &ndash; Stecha &ndash; hard to tell" as well as reference to certain matters of the past, with mention of twenty-five years before, and mention of "my good wife, M---." "I have simply written," wrote Mr. Sadony, "what to me would sound foolish, without knowing just all that is meant by it."
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply: "The Herman you spoke of... was my father who passed out twenty-five years ago. M--- is my mother, Lisette is my sister and Chris is my brother...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 104 &ndash; "When the first impression came, I imagined I sensed your mother's father &ndash; an old man &ndash; bent over, round-shouldered. He apparently assisted in giving me the impression which I enclose. Now you understand that I am not a spiritualist. Neither am I connected with any 'ism', I am alone in this study... for the purpose of research, consequently with no other motive than to know the truth...."
							</p>
							<p>
								(The message made reference to four names, and personal matters. It was signed by the mother and addressed indirectly to the son.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 118 &ndash; "While speaking this into my dictaphone, a strange sentence comes to me. I am taking chances that it belongs to some of you." (Message followed addressed to "Dear Anna." At the end of the two hundred words there was a break in the middle of a sentence. Mr. Sadony had been called to the phone. "I have tried to get more," he wrote, "but could not. All I could receive was 'Otto'".
							</p>
							<p>
								The reply read: "I thank you for the message for my Aunt Annie.... etc."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 580 &ndash; "This is my first letter to you. Miss --- gave me your address and told me of your good work, and I gave your name and address to a Miss C., who is living with me at present. She wrote you last week, and in your letter to her you sent a message which I know was meant for me.... It was from an ex-husband, who seems to realize how he wronged me, and the mistakes he made. But I do not think of the tears he caused me. I only think of the nice things he did...."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 652 &ndash; "Now you speak of getting a mental message concerning an elderly lady named Anna. My mother's name is Anna...."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Enclosed you will find a copy of the thoughts that came to me while dictating your letter. You are a stranger to me, and I to you. In writing these letters I write just what comes to my mind at the time, but I seldom send all I receive, because I am but a student, who has found some strange life's problems, and this is my mode of study...."
							</p>
							<p>
								(This message began "Dearest Anna or Nellie." The latter was the name of the daughter, the correspondent in this case. There was reference to twenty-three and thirty-two years before, as well as the name of another. It was signed by name.)
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 390 &ndash; A letter was received from Chicago. Mr. Sadony wrote, "To me it appears as if you did not live in Chicago, as your surroundings do not indicate it.... Seems to me more like a village...."
							</p>
							<p>
								"You speak of my being a lawyer or salesman, but what of the new project you speak of, what do you see?.... How did you get that I was not in service?.... My wife and I live in a small suburb of Chicago, a village of 5000 inhabitants. I am serving this village as a village trustee. My business is selling sugar on commission."
							</p>
							<p>
								CASE 419 &ndash; "By the way, does your tooth bother you? Left, lower second molar? If so, look after them soon."
							</p>
							<p>
								"My lower left molar bothered me a little but not much. Thanks!" (Letter 6671.)
							</p>
							<p>
								From case 764 &ndash; "Tell me, has there been poison in his blood within the last seven years? Either his kidneys or his bladder seem to have been affected...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Reply stated that he had been a printer all his life, and the poison in his body was printer's lead.
