									&quot;My philosophy is not new. It is but the true inspiration of the prophets of old: for I do prophesy things that are to come. And if I am able to do so, then I must live in the future in order to bring it back today.
								</p>
								<p>
									&quot;Our &apos;knowledge&apos; began in the past, by the accumulation of timber as material to compare with these things that happen each day. But that inspiration which every child of God can acquire, has been, is, and will continue to be in the very air we breathe. It is recorded as the rippling sands upon the sea-shore, which give evidence that there have been waves as sculptors; and when you see the waves, they tell you that they are sculptors at work, doing what they have done centuries ago, and will continue so to do.&quot;

							<h4>
								About Joseph Sadony
							</h4>
							<p class="center note80">[A little tedious, presumptive, but has some good info.]</p>
							<p>
								Most of us think of a "Prophet" and the "spirit of prophecy" as a thing of the past. If we should ask a modern business man whether Prophets lived today, he might smile. Yet he is himself a "Prophet" or he would not be a successful business man.
							</p>
							<p>
								The fault lies in association of thought and emotion about a word, such as "Prophet", and an idea, such as "Prophecy", which originally rotted themselves in the soil of a religion fertilized by superstition and blind unreasoning faith.
							</p>
							<!-- Next paragraph is not in Gary's, typed in by sh from scan -->
							<p>
								It is a human &quot;faculty&quot; of which we speak in a new, not a preconceived light: a milestone of evolution, the application of which is asserted at the focus of interest and vluntary activity, be that what it may for the indivuidual &ndash; religious, scientific, or industrial.
							</p>
							<p>
								The man of today might prefer the term "Seer", for his encyclopedia tells him that a "Seer, in the sense in which all antiquity believed in them, is simply a man who sees what others cannot see, whether of public or private interest" &ndash; whereas the Prophet is "an organ of Jehovah's Kingship over His people...."
							</p>
							<p>
								The spirit of prophecy in the light of today retains the idea of foreseeing, (prevision), of foretelling, (prediction), but is stripped of Mystery and fanaticism. It is as free as the air we breathe, and not the reward exclusively of long struggling and ridiculous self-torture.
							</p>
							<p>
								Call it a "Hunch", an "Inspiration" &ndash; what you please. It is a "feeling in your bones", whether based on experience amassed subconsciously through years of effort, or utterly without foundation of reason and logic. It is the "Intuition" which has evolved from animal Instinct, through knowledge in man, to itself as the mark of the "superman" that we may each become. It is to quote Mr. Sadony, "that law which governs crystallization in minerals, a law of individuality which governs instinct, the milestone of distinct species in animals: character and personality in man...."
							</p>
							<p>
								Each generation brings its greater Prophets. We call them "men of foresight", and speak of their deep insight into this and that &ndash; which is sufficient. They do not all cry out to the multitude. They may prophesy by their endeavors. They may materialize their own visions before others think to reap the fruit of what is possible, therefore inevitable if human progress is a fact.
							</p>
							<p>
								We each tend to prophesy within boundaries familiar to our ambition. Our scope measures our prophecy. "I don't believe it will rain today," we state. "I wonder if...." and then we forget the conclusion of our own thoughts.
							</p>
							<p>
								A genius in any line confines his thought and efforts to the field of his interest. He specializes. He speaks with authority of past and present, which entitles him to "expectations" that are no less than predictions.
							</p>
							<p>
								A Prophet to all would need be practiced in every trade, familiar with every tool, experienced in each phase of life.
							</p>
							<p>
								False prophets are many. Thirst for gain or fame carries them out of bounds on wings of an imagination nourished by vanity but not governed by reason.
							</p>
							<p>
								The essential thread of mankind has not changed. Intelligence of the past was transformed into beauty and jewels, instead of mechanical achievements. The Egyptians erected pyramids and preserved their dead instead of conquering the air. The Chinese studied stars and made delicate instruments of ivory, instead of harnessing steam in an engine. The age of specialization had not yet come. A man was a man; if a "scientist" he was likely also a "priest"; if he thought at all, he was a "philosopher". Life as a whole was unified by that attitude which, being the "cause" of religion, was essentially religious.
							</p>
							<p>
								Born on the crest of each wave of thought are its own prophets. Early interest was national, religious, militant. The spokesmen prophesied wars, the fate of nations, the wrath of a God. Later interest was individual, industrial, scientific. There was reaction against war and a revengeful God. Prophecy concerned itself with individual desire, needs, ambitions, with political and business ventures, scientific discoveries; it was in terms of love, happiness, peace, a state of mind and manner of living symbolized in "paradise" rather than "falling cities".... ...
							</p>
							<p>
								The astronomy of early China gave birth to astrologers that were punished with death for a mistaken prophecy. Astronomy today reveals prophets of eclipses, of comets, of all stellar movement according to known laws. And prophecy implies rather than prohibits such a knowledge of determined laws, be they of mathematics, Nature, or human nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								A physician is consulted. By application of knowledge to his observations he diagnoses the present, deduces the past, and foresees likely developments which to the extent of his ability he controls. Without this insight into present and past, with its resultant foresight, he would fail in his profession.
							</p>
							<p>
								Success in any line of endeavor is evidence of the conscious or unconscious use of this "power", be it what it may. In fact, the test of the prophet is in achievement. A false prophet will have "words" without works.
							</p>
							<p>
								So it is not difficult to find the true prophets. Edison made a business of organizing the fulfillment of "prophecies" on a large scale. The Wright brothers, Bell, Marconi &ndash; each a prophet in his own way. Then we find the "Business Prophets", whose vision leads them to promote plans that determine the future condition of thousands of employees. Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford, in fact every millionaire who did not inherit his money, are all Prophets.
							</p>
							<p>
								Artists and authors strive to imprison their visions in pictures, symbols, words. Musicians and dramatists anticipate the trend of human emotions and often think themselves to be molding it, whereas they are merely the slaves.
							</p>
							<p>
								An adequate study of living prophets would necessitate a catalogue of human endeavors, which in an age of specialization would be a tremendous task.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our point is made. To those who have not understood the nature of Mr. Sadony's work, we wish to say that whereas another might choose electricity, one of the sciences or arts, business or politics, Mr. Sadony has chosen as his field of labor, the human being which includes them all. His studies have been the human mind with all its attributes, human nature, human emotions, strengths, failings, possibilities and limitations. He has explored the human heart in all phases of life. He has equipped himself by experience with a knowledge of every tool and endeavor. He has undergone all sorrows, joys, as well as tortures to which the flesh is heir, that he might see and feel the needs of others. And he has investigated every line of thought and belief in the freedom of being identified with none.
							</p>
							<p>
								For thirty years, without exacting compensation of any kind, Mr. Sadony has devoted his life to the solving of human problems.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this, his chosen field, have this insight and foresight applied themselves. And that we, his friends, might better understand a certain result that we have questioned, he has permitted this booklet to be prepared, in which we quote, from letters, observations and accounts, a brief glimpse of the great amount of evidence on hand that the mind is indeed a human radio, that thoughts are things, and that the "spirit of prophecy", far from being a thing of the dead past, is a vital activity of the human soul, expressing itself in all human endeavors as orderly and unmistakably as instinct in the perpetuation and preservation of animal species.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr. Sadony applied his theories not alone to others but to himself. That they "worked" was a matter of great moment to those who sought his advice.
							</p>
							<p>
								He did find the sane solution of life and happiness in the world. Twenty years ago he set out to demonstrate that a man could build himself a "paradise on earth" with nothing but the desire to do so. His own desire for seclusion on a little eighty acre farm, near a large body of water, with a hill and valley, a winding stream, a grove of virgin pine, was so clearly formed as to convince him that it was the shadow of a reality that existed.
							</p>
							<p>
								He sent forth a description. The place was found, but was not for sale. "It belongs to me!" he declared. And circumstances of the owners soon resulted in a reasonable sale. But it required all that he possessed. Then, without money, and as a labor of love, he built his paradise, The Valley of the Pines.
							</p>
							<p>
								The world soon beat a path to his door. He continued his work of advising, without charge, the many thousands that wrote or came to him. His correspondence became so heavy at last that he was forced to select a little "flock", over which he watched more closely, keeping in touch with them through correspondence. This "little flock" contained two thousand families in five hundred towns, in forty-three states and twenty-six foreign countries. Hundreds traveled long distances to talk with him. Still he found time to labor, and at the end of seventeen years felt that he had sufficiently demonstrated what a man could do with "nothing", and that it was time to apply his theory to "business" for the better support of his family, as well as those whom he desired to help through charity.
							</p>
							<p>
								His Valley was now a miniature kingdom, equipped with every tool, convenience and need. He had made a machine to form concrete blocks with which he built a laboratory for experiment in many fields; a studio for his correspondence, library and collection of curios; and a little home for his mother.
							</p>
							<p>
								So at length he allowed himself to become known in a business way: first as "Consulting Efficiency Expert", and then as "Advising Promoter and Consulting Executive" &ndash; not a sacrifice of his chosen work, but that he might better carry out his purpose among those in need.
							</p>
							<p>
								The field of interest in a work of such scope, is unlimited. The subject in question, however, is "prophecy." This includes with foresight, an insight into present and past, as well as that sensitivity of the mind which might be discussed in terms of "psychometry", or "telepathy", but finds more perfect illustration in its own counterpart and creation, the Radio" all thoughts that ever were or will be.
							</p>
							<p>
								After thorough investigation extending over a long period of years, the evidence at hand has been found undeniable. The brief records to follow have been selected from unpublished records containing hundreds of cases in all details. But we agree with Mr. Sadony, that predictions, in themselves, whatever the comfort to an individual, are after all of less importance than that attitude or philosophy of life of which his foresight, success and mode of living are but the fruits.
