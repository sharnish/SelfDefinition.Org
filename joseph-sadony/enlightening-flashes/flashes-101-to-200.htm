								<li>WHY NOT ELIMINATE doubt and give your hope a chance to strengthen your faith in yourself? </li>
								<li>THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY for a man to lose a real friend, and that is for him to lose himself. </li>
								<li>A "BIG SHOT" is a little shot trying to be a big shot. </li>
								<li>A THIEF steals from himself his clear conscience. </li>
								<li>HE WHO HATES ANOTHER borrows from his victim, fear. </li>
								<li>MAKE MEN fear your honesty, respect your understanding, and love your kindness. </li>
								<li>A DOG ONLY BARKS; it requires man's reason to know why. </li>
								<li>THE CURE for idle misery is labor's contentment. </li>
								<li>HE WHO HOLDS HIS FIRE has always death to deal out. </li>
								<li>THE WAGES of happiness are found in frugality and thrift. </li>
								<li>EVERYBODY WANTS to wear diamonds but they don't want to dig for them. </li>
								<li>WHAT YOU WANTED YESTERDAY is dead today. </li>
								<li>IF YOU ARE GUILTY of anything don't look for powder or dynamite with a match. </li>
								<li>NO MATTER WHO the pagan may be I shall still respect his God. </li>
								<li>THERE IS SOMETHING suspected and expected of every man. </li>
								<li>SOME PEOPLE won't like what they could like, so they look for what they can't like if they have it. </li>
								<li>WE OFTEN SAVE our lives by the sacrifice of what we lost. </li>
								<li>HOW EASY IT IS to get courage; and with courage, how easy it is to succeed! </li>
								<li>IF ONE DOESN'T KNOW what to give, he has nothing to receive. </li>
								<li>YOU ARE UNWORTHY of protection if you do not do your part, as weak as it may be, to prevent. </li>
								<li>BE PATIENT! Eternity teaches us never to count. </li>
								<li>THE MAN WHO ACTS with vulgarity has no respect for respect. </li>
								<li>NEGLECTED VIRTUES become burdens of necessity. </li>
								<li>GOD WAITS to win back His own flowers as gifts from man's hands. </li>
								<li>FORTUNATE IS THE MAN who knows his own faults and does not defend them. </li>

								<li>HE WHO TAKES NO advantage of others is doubly welcome by all, even a vicious dog. </li>
								<li>WITH HONOR come responsibilities, and with responsibilities come worry if you don't relax. </li>
								<li>IF YOU CAN'T lengthen your life by years, do so by activity. </li>
								<li>DON'T HAVE such respect for a person unworthy that it will make you lose respect for yourself. </li>
								<li>IF YOU THINK you have time to burn, why not wait until after you die before blistering your friends. </li>
								<li>BE SURE that your gratefulness is honest gratitude, and not a bait. </li>
								<li>"I NEVER HURT ANYBODY." <em>No. But you don't save anybody either.</em> </li>
								<li>IF YOU ACCEPT flattery, and thank the flatterer you give a receipt for counterfeit money. </li>
								<li>ALL LIFE IS A LABOR until we love to labor, and then it is play. </li>
								<li>THE LORD POINTS where the water is; man must make a pump. </li>
								<li>EVERYTHING IS STUBBORN &ndash; when dirty. </li>
								<li>BLESSED IS HE who knows what to do &ndash; and does it. </li>
								<li>IT IS ONLY A FOOL who can be discourteous. </li>
								<li>IN THE WORLD OF DISCORD EVERY deed done must be accounted for by him who did it. </li>
								<li>PEOPLE WHO THINK OUT LOUD are just as shallow as what they say. </li>
								<li>POWER is for him who is strong enough to harness it, and wise enough to use it properly. </li>
								<li>A MAN WHO IS ALIVE can no more prove he is alive than a man who is dead can prove he is dead. </li>
								<li>WE LIVE WITHIN THE TRUE LAW only when we are not aware of anything else. </li>
								<li>GOD PUTS INTO the brain of man the value of his existence. Thus a fool treads where angels fear. </li>
								<li>IF YOU HAVE something to give, where did you get it? </li>

								<li>WHY DOES FEAR follow the death of desire, where faith doubts and hope turns into despair. </li>
								<li>HALF THE WORLD'S BATTLES are lost by the efforts to win them. </li>
								<li>YOU BLEW UP your dynamite without knowing what it was. </li>
								<li>A NEW BROOM sweeps no cleaner than an old one. It depends on the hands that grasp it. It is the ambition of him who sweeps. </li>
								<li>A MAN WHO TALKS TOO MUCH <em>has already</em> neglected his day's labor. </li>
								<li>EPITAPH: For the lack of ambition to blind his fear he remained a coward. </li>
								<li>THERE IS STILL more hope for fools that are than those that were. </li>
								<li>LET THE TROUBLES of others burn out your own. </li>
								<li>THE VALUE of a pitcher is known only after it is broken; and then it is useless. </li>
								<li>WHEN YOU FLATTER your friend you strengthen his vanity and adulterate his virtues. </li>
								<li>NO ONE CAN TELL how cold it is until he can tell how warm it was. </li>
								<li>A FOOL may find fault with you; but are you wise enough to recognize your own? </li>
								<li>THE MAN WHO PLAYS FAIR and loses, wins. </li>
								<li>THE MAN WHO CAN lose himself in his work will find himself in his play. </li>

								<li>IF YOU HAVE something to give away, and don't, then it is lost to you. </li>
								<li>THE MAN WHO IS remembered most, was most. </li>
								<li>WHEN GOD can trust you, you are apt to live up to it. </li>
								<li>HE WHO CRITICISES the good bread offered, is not hungry &ndash; but soon will be. </li>
								<li>TAKE A LITTLE, improve a little, and leave a little, to be remembered a little. </li>
								<li>SOME MEN who want to be good, try so hard that they become bad. </li>
								<li>MEN ARE CHOSEN who are best able to do what is best, under the law of moral compensation. </li>
								<li>THE MAN WHO GIVES of himself lives the length of its value even though he be dead. </li>
								<li>WHEN A MAN ADMITS he knows nothing, he is measuring what he doesn't know. </li>
