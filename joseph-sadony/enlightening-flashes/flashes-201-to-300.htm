								<li>WE MUST LEARN not to allow minor influences to control us; we must be conscious of our own propelling force. </li>
								<li>CONDEMNATION has <em>not</em> the greatest effect to eliminate vice, but careful praise for the remaining virtue. </li>
								<li>HE WHO CAN ACCEPT REBUKE with gratefulness will soon learn to wield a sceptor with Justice. </li>
								<li>HE WHO LEARNS TO SUBDUE his lesser senses, acquires greater power in thought, which is the blossom of the next newborn fruit. </li>
								<li>USE SYMPATHY and you won't lose it. </li>
								<li>LOVE HAS HOPE where reason dies of starvation. </li>
								<li>IT IS NOT ALWAYS a change of mind, but a change of food, that drops the wrench in the gears. </li>
								<li>OFTEN WE ABSORB KNOWLEDGE or food not meant for us, and of which, like a stain, we must rid ourselves in order to start anew. </li>
								<li>DO YOU NEED A LIFETIME of experience to find out that you were born to have been what you will; and that your bulbs were born before your blossoms? </li>
								<li>FAITH IS A LIVING BOOK of future events; history but experience of the dead. </li>
								<li>WHEN A MAN ACQUIRES more than he deserves, that moment he loses the value and pleasure of it all. </li>
								<li>A MAN BECOMES WISER in the attitude of aspiration than in the realization of his acquired knowledge. </li>
								<li>IT'S NOT WHAT you make; it's how you make it, that lives after you. "How" is it's soul. </li>
								<li>WHAT GOOD ARE LESSONS if you don't learn them? </li>
								<li>IF YOU INTEND to climb a high mountain, don't tie yourself to relations who can't. </li>
								<li>YOU MUST LIVE long enough to forget your faults. </li>
								<li>OFTEN TESTS of worthiness are made through sorrow, depressions and catastrophies. <em>Cheer up!</em> </li>
								<li>HOW HAVE YOU kept house in that body of yours, to make it think the thots you do? </li>
								<li>SCRATCH A MAKE-BELIEVE bite long enough and you soon will be obliged to heal it up. </li>
								<li>IT IS ONLY TODAY that you may leave your mark. Fail not, good or ill, for others to behold. </li>
								<li>THERE IS ALWAYS a future. <em>Eternity is proof of that.</em> </li>
								<li>PEOPLE SEEM TO FORGET God when most in need of Him. </li>
								<li>IT IS ONLY FALSE PRIDE that tries to exhibit a greatness that is not possessed. </li>
								<li>THE TRUTH ANSWERS for itself if one is patient. </li>
								<li>WHEN IN A MOB it is best to drift along, or you will be trampled upon. </li>

								<li>IF YOU CAN'T walk or talk yourself out of it, think yourself out of it. </li>
								<li>YOU MAY SEE your virtues; but the question is, do you feel them? </li>
								<li>SO FEW SEEK THE FUTURE that those who do are alone. </li>
								<li>OUR OWN SINS judge us; our own virtues forgive us. </li>
								<li>HE WHO TALKS too much is baiting a trap for a hungry man who, when caught, starves to death. </li>
								<li>IT IS ONLY A FOOL who is ever ready to call others one. </li>
								<li>THE TRUTH is no better for your telling it, but you are better for trying to be a part of it. </li>
								<li>IS THE OPINION of a fool more valuable than the oath of a hypocrite? </li>
								<li>WHICH IS GREATER: <em>an honest failure</em> or a cheater's success? </li>
								<li>A BIG MAN can be simple and small; but a small man can't afford to be big, for then he won't live long. </li>
								<li>CAN GOD TRUST <em>you with the confidence of a sinner?</em> </li>
								<li>IF YOU ARE NOT in touch with God above the clouds, then you are under the dominion of man. </li>
								<li>WHY DO SO MANY good ears listen to evil tongues, then wonder what blinded them? </li>
								<li>A MAN WITH BRAINS on a tension is hurt by idle and useless things. </li>
								<li>SWEETNESS can be surpassed only by a pinch of salt or a drop of bitter. </li>
								<li>MANY USE THE COIN of sorrow to pay for lasting happiness. </li>
								<li>WITHOUT A FULCRUM a crow-bar isn't worth a darn. </li>
								<li>WHEN A MAN DWELLS on what he has done, he shows what he can't do, or he would have done it. </li>
								<li>YOU TAKE WHAT YOU GET; ah yes, but you don't get what you take. </li>
								<li>LITTLE THINGS look best in small mirrors, and are more appreciated. </li>

								<li>HIS FALSE PRIDE and his own deception changed the name of God to <em>Satan.</em> </li>

								<li>A MAN who has to live on the past is a scavenger. </li>
