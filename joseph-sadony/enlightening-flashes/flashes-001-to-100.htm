								<li>GOOD IDEAS, like money should be in circulation to better the world's population. </li>
								<li>THE REASON MOST MEN WEAR OUT is because they don't know how to transform the beautiful things around them into energy and enthusiasm. </li>
								<li>WE FEAR <em>for what we doubt in our own.</em> </li>
								<li>THE SAME POWER THAT CREATES is there waiting only for an instant of unbalance to burst its bonds of destruction. </li>
								<li>WHEN YOU HEAR A SHOT, don't worry if you hear the echo. </li>
								<li>WE ARE APT TO FORGET that the leveling of the ocean is not the affair of two drops. </li>
								<li>THE BEST TALKER is the man who knows what to say at the right time. </li>
								<li>AN IDLE MAN is as useful as a car stalled in traffic without gasoline; and as helpless. </li>
								<li>IF YOU DON'T strive for a thing, someone else will use you to do so. </li>
								<li>MAN SEES only what he feels, and feels what he longs for. </li>
								<li>HE WHO DEFENDS HIMSELF for a virtue he does not possess, adds theft to his sin. </li>
								<li>HAPPY IS THE MAN who can make what he needs with what he has. </li>
								<li>LIFE is the expression of nature; but love is the expression of God. </li>
								<li>THE DANGER in life is to feel too safe &ndash; or not safe enough. </li>
								<li>THE MAN WHO STARTS a stampede shall be under it if he cannot direct it. </li>
								<li>WE LEARN KNOWLEDGE <em>by success,</em> but wisdom from failure. </li>
								<li>NO ONE CAN FORCE you to break your will but yourself. </li>
								<li>THOSE GUILTY of sin are the first to believe a liar. </li>
								<li>SOMETIMES WE THINK we become angered by someone else; but it is ourselves. </li>
								<li>MAN MAKES WHAT HE CAN to pay for what he can't. </li>
								<li>IF PLEASURE <em>makes you forget,</em> by sorrow shall you become wise to prevent. </li>
								<li>WITH THE SAME NUMBER there are more friends amidst poverty than in wealth. </li>
								<li>ARE NOT YOUR LOSSES often due to unexpected profits? </li>
								<li>HE WHO MAKES himself a slave to truth becomes a master. </li>
								<li>THE MAN WHO KNOWS what he wants is already half way on the road to success in attaining it. </li>

								<li>A WHEAT will never be a corn, no matter what fertilizer you use for it. </li>
								<li>FAULT FINDS FAULT with itself. </li>
								<li>WE ARE EACH a missing page of a Book, looking for the Book. </li>
								<li>IT IS WELL to learn new swear words so we won't get too used to the old ones. </li>
								<li>IF YOU WANT VENGEANCE without regret, don't interfere with God's justice. </li>
								<li>SOME OF US FIND a truth, and expect to spend it without having earned or paid for it. </li>
								<li>HE WHO SAYS faith is blind, is blind to faith. </li>
								<li>WHERE REASON can avoid extremes, logic can control them. </li>
								<li>EAT WHEN YOU EAT <em>and you will sleep when you sleep.</em> </li>
								<li>MAN IS TESTED only by his faith to endure. </li>
								<li>ONE NEED NOT express in words what the heart never forgets. </li>
								<li>A FOOL acts according to what he is; a wise man according to what he'd like to be. </li>
								<li>IF A MAN can sit and listen to birds and enjoy it, he is not very far from God. </li>
								<li>THE AUTOGRAPH on a photograph is like the handclasp with the extra grip. </li>
								<li>WE FORGET out secret debts, then bemoan the consequences. </li>
								<li>EVEN THE VERY GOOD can be selfish to gratify the ego to make others happy. </li>
								<li>WHY BELIEVE AN ECHO if you have the voice? </li>
								<li>WHEN KINGS dethrone fools, they join them. </li>
								<li>STICK TO YOUR JOB or someone else will find yours easier than you thought. </li>
