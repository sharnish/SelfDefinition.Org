								<em>My son, should I ask these questions? If not then why asketh thou not?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, I HAVE BEEN CONFUSED mentally by sensing the thoughts and grief of others. Was it so with you?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>It was ever thus and ever will be in the redemption of mankind who may know all things, but will not.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT SHALL I DO TO OVERCOME THIS HELPLESSNESS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Accept it in the spirit of love and confidence to transmute it as thou will it. Good, in faith, overcometh all evil, discord and despair. For what thou believeth thou maketh.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								IF ONLY I COULD EVER ASK OF YOU!
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thou must share thy time as the day does the night to create the energizing sunrise and the calm, restful sunset, spring and autumn, man and wife. Pay thy tribute to mortality on thy way to immortality. This is the law under which thou art holden.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WILL WE EVER KNOW?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Yes, in the solitude of thy thoughts, when thine eyes and ears have been filled too overflowing wilt thou think realities. For what thou art, comes from within. What thou covet is but grafted on thee to bear the fruit of others for them, not for thee.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, I AM SO GRATEFUL AND CONTRITE FOR YOUR ANSWER.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>But, my son, I have asked thee for the moment, to prove that we are always together. Canst thou deny thy shadow after sunset? If so, stand with thy back to the lamplight and behold the result of thy substance.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								IT SEEMS SO SELFISH ON MY PART.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Wouldst thou accuse me of the same for thee, expecting thee to hear me? What is the difference between a question and answer if the truth was ever present? Which is the most important: the question or the answer?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHEN WILL MEN UNDERSTAND?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>When their soul starves for their Creator.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD WE TRY TO CONVINCE THEM?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Canst thou walk through a locked door even though the hypocrite calls, 'Come in', who would listen but believe thee not, only to steal thy effort and time at their own price? One will find listeners where there are no doors.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER I FEEL BETTER NOW.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thus one feels at the dawn of a new day: thine and mine.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								LET US MEET SOON AGAIN.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>That, my son, must be thy will, as God's be done. I shall await thy coming always. Peace be thine.</em>
