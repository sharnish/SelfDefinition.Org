							<p>
								I thought: WHAT IS NORMALCY OR EMOTION?
							</p>
							<p>
								I got answer: <em>Test thy pulse, thy temperature and the strength of thy heart-strings. If they agree, thou art normal. If not, thou wouldst not ask the question &ndash; the sin already committed.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHY ARE MEN SO BLIND?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Dost thou think they are, or do they but appear to be. Dost thou think thyself to be? Dost thou express all that thy vision beholds? Do the blind?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								IT SEEMS SUCH A TASK TO CONVINCE BY THE SIMPLE TRUTH.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Why identify, christen or title each seed in Latin or Greek? I give thee when asked of thee. Will not each seed speak for itself when planted to blossom and bear fruit for him who asked of thee?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>He who asks of thee, and still beholds not what is in thy hands, must have a concept of expectancy. Thus answer only at the knock at thy door. A sign of a fish on the door was an invitation to my disciples; but not so to the profane.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THEN, MASTER, I SHOULD SCATTER SEEDS EVERYWHERE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Yes, they will not be wasted, even among rocks (hearts of stone); some, to feed the least of them, (insects). The select and worthy will find fertile ground to flourish in my name and offer up the fruits of truth and love.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT SO MUCH CAN BE DONE WHEN SO MANY DIE IN VAIN, WITHOUT RESULT!
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Did I die in vain with so little results or display as only a malefactor between two thieves?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								NO, MASTER; YOU WERE THE SYMBOL OF GOD, HIS SHADOW.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Then what are silent shadows that identify a substance or a cause self- creative?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT SHALL I DO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Just deliver the message to him intended. He is responsible as to its meaning: thy duty fulfilled; his, pending.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHALL I WAIT FOR A RESPONSE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>No. That is his responsibility to know and to do. He can read.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								DO I WASTE TIME IN DOING?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Are not each five minutes of the clock's time identified to be accurate? Only some seem longer on the part of him who doubts, fears or is too mortal.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD WE STUDY THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Dost thou study the highest technique of the university in thy kindergarten or primer class of school? Hast thou the answer to mortality? If not, study and acquire the parables nature reveals every day. Then thy knowledge of mortality will be the question that immortality shall answer for thee.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HOW SHALL WE LEARN THIS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Behold the eyes of a child as new things appear before it: blind to a gold, diamond-studded watch but not to its ticking. Its simple mind questions only that which is simple to its understanding. Ask a master jeweler to look at thy price-less watch. He will ask how many seconds does it gain or lose in a month. Thus that which appears interesting to thee is already a part of thee &ndash; until thy album of memory be filled as tools and instruments to make use of. And when thou hast filled this album from cover to cover, thou shalt find thy answer of immortality in thy last word, 'Finale' &ndash; newly born spiritual childhood.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, SHALL I MAKE THESE WRITINGS PUBLIC?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, must thou go before thy door to knock for admittance to enter? Let the student and seeker find thy door in search for what he hast not. Does not every chimney belch forth smoke in the cold winter to reveal occupants? Do men seek alone what they have lost, or do they seek for what they never possessed? Reveal only that which is asked for &ndash; to be appreciated, preserved and made use of.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THAT, DEAR MASTER, I SHALL DO BY YOUR KIND HELP.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, 'tis well. Be thou prepared for greater duties, responsibilities and labor of love for thy brother man and my lost sheep. I shall guide thee as I have ever done. Again eternity answers that question. I shall await the coming of thee and thine. So when I ask one of thy companions to come unto me, mourn not.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THY WILL BE DONE IN THE NAME OF GOD.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Amen, my son.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THANK YOU, MASTER; I WILL DO MY PART.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>'Tis well, for they are waiting for the message entrusted to thee and my followers. Peace be with thee.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AMEN.
