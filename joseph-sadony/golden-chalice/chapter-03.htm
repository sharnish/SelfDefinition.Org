								I thought: WHAT IS TIME?
							</p>
							<p>
								I got my answer: <em>the strength and limitations of thy main spring, wound up through nature by the hand of God. 'Tis not thy hour and minute hands that tell the time, but the energy within the spring born of a thought.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD WE COUNT THE HOURS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Do so, and thou hast forgotten Eternity. Create and forget time that exists only in thy mental concept, the influence of mortal things.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								DEAR MASTER, I AM SO HAPPY WITH YOUR NEARNESS EVEN IF IT BE ONLY IN MY IMAGINATION.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, though it be but thy concept, tell me why it gives thee that joy not sensed by those who have greater imagination than thine. If thine be self-creating, canst thou pull thyself up by thine own bootstraps; or art thou lifted up by hands other than thine own?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, SHOULD ONE DISPUTE OR DEFEND THE TRUTH OF IMMORTALITY?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, dost the review of the two opponents reveal anything new, or that which has not been recorded as truth &ndash; thus not enlightened, and less friendly? If truth has not revealed itself, be silent until manifested.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT MENTAL ATTITUDE SHOULD ONE HAVE IN A SEARCH FOR TRUTH?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The same as when thou art hungry or thirsty. What effort dost thou make to gratify or to die?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHERE CAN TRUTH BE FOUND?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>All within the functions of thy body, its precepts and reflections which symbolize every living thing and chemical on earth: even to the storms and lightning, anger and tidal waves of destruction and hatred; a living universal dictionary &ndash; including even the answer to what and where God is; an atom of God, the Author of progress and evolution upwards, which by inherited faith thou assumeth and for which thou striveth; where hope gives thee thy desire that love amplifies.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, WHAT WOULD THE WORLD DO WITHOUT YOU AND THE GOLDEN RULE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>I will let the very few who have seen answer that.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHY CAN THEY NOT SEE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Because they have been taught by the profane only to hear what is told them, blind and deaf to aught else.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, WHOM SHOULD WE SERVE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, be not influenced by anyone, man or woman. Dost thou regard one finger of thy hand as a favorite? No good great man would expect it of another as great as he may assume himself to be. To contact thee is to admit he knocks at thy door which must ever be open to the least of them. A closed door is for those blind, deaf to the Lord and unworthy.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD WE GO OUT OF OUR WAY?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Hast thou not? Is thy house not built on a rock? Let those who are lost go out of their way to meet thee for directions to their home.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD I LABOR MORE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Some accomplish more in idleness before choice. He who thinks, labors less but creates more, he who thinks less, adds more burden on his shoulders to labor for him who thinks for him.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER DO INSPIRE US THROUGH THESE BLACK CLOUDS OF SELFISH DOUBT. MY WILL I OFFER TO YOU FREELY. I SHALL OBEY EVEN UNTO DEATH.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Then, my son, thou hast life as thy gift. I shall not be silent to thy offer.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AGAIN I HAVE THE COURAGE TO GO ON.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Then follow my footsteps with my blessings.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THAT I WILL, MASTER.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>I know thy heart. Peace be with thee and thine.</em>
