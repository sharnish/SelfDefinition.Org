								MASTER, IT HAS BEEN A LONG WHILE SINCE I HAVE ASKED QUESTIONS OF YOU.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, nights are not always the same length; and if too long, then the day is shorter with its light to see by.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT IS LIFE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Study death and thou shalt know.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THEN WHAT IS DEATH?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The birth of Life.</em><em> Ask the fragrance of a rose that whispers only in spirit. Listen likewise.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHY ARE MEN SO CONFUSED AS TO SPIRITUAL TRUTHS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Because speechless men preach to the deaf, and neither know it because they will it not.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT IS THE QUICKEST AND SUREST METHOD TO PEACE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Understand the Golden Rule and the consequences of its violation.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT IS MODERN RELIGION COMING TO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>A universal understanding where hunger, mental and physical starvation, will ask the question; and the answer will be, 'Love ye one another as my Father loveth thee and as I do.'</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>To its senses.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THROUGH WHAT CHANNEL, MASTER?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Through the heartaches of mothers bereft, and those guilty of shedding blood.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT SHALL WE DO TO HELP?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Ask a faithful shepherd what he does at sunset for his flock. He may tell thee that he sleeps at daylight.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT WE SEEM SO IDLE.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>A lull before activity.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								I WILL DO MY BEST TO CARRY ON BLINDLY.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Do this, my son, and thine eyes shall be more keen to the wants of those who have appealed to me half-heartedly.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WILL THIS EVER BE A PERFECT WORLD TO LIVE IN?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>It has been and still is. It is only the children of men with poor examples shown that appear imperfect, but still drift to that understanding of spiritual inheritance where the body labors and the spirit evaporates back to its Creator, a released prisoner from earth's green grass.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								CAN WE DEVELOP FASTER THAN WE DO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>If thou wilt gaze at the hands of a clock and a small watch, both will reveal the correct time. Go no farther. Do not count their ticking. It will confuse thee as foolish questions and answers. Thou asketh for the time, not how and why. Time is the keeper of thy mortal prison.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WOULD PEOPLE MOCK ME WERE THEY TO READ THESE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Does not an idiot gaze into the mirror to criticise and mock him whom he sees in it? Men see only what they think.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HAVE I MADE MANY MISTAKES?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Who has not? The more made, and victorious, the greater the reward. There is a vast difference between a sainted sinner and a sinful saint.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WILL GOD FORGIVE US FOR OUR MISTAKES?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Yes, if thou hast forgiven the mistakes made by others against thee. According to what thou hast done to others, the same must thou expect to be done unto thee; for thou art the father of it. Thus is the law where the child be witness against thee.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								IS THERE NOTHING EVER FORGOTTEN?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Canst thou annihilate an atom which is a lesser reality?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THEN WHAT IS MEMORY?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The witness of action for God.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHY DO THEY ARGUE SO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Because they know so little, and fear to reveal it; while others try to convince a fool who reveals what he is by what he does not know.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								DO REAL WISE MEN ARGUE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Seldom.</em><em> They realize so much that they don't know, hence in fear they might miss something they forgot to argue.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT SHOULD CHILDREN BE TAUGHT FIRST?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Respect for those who protect them.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND THEN?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Faith in a law of a God.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND THEN?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Reason, logic and application unto good deeds.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AND THEN?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Nothing.</em><em> For then they may teach thee.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES MAN THINK?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Light added to light, until there be understanding.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT IS UNDERSTANDING?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Reality.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT IS REALITY?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>That which always was, is now, and ever will be, as understandable as light is to thought: that thought which a spark of thy soul ignited to behold a God.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT SHALL I DO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Ask that of my hungry lambs and weary sheep; they will answer thee.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								PLEASE BE NEAR ME TODAY SO I WILL WASTE NO TIME.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>I shall always be at thy side. There is no time for my followers, hence no time to waste. Thus waste is but a loss to him who neglects normalcy or who takes from those who make light of values &ndash; at their loss; so they must search for time to repay their loss to them. There is self-created time paid objectively, by neglect.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, I WILL DO MY BEST TO IMPROVE BY YOUR HELP.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, what thou art have I chosen. 'Tis not in vain. Greater work shall be done when thy shoulders become stronger to help carry the shadow of my cross.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THANK YOU, DEAREST MASTER.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Peace to thee and thine, my son.</em>
