								MASTER, WHY DO SOME MEN DENY GOD?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>They do not, my son. They but think they do. And what are thoughts? Echoes from the soundingboard of their choice.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT WHAT CAN WE DO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Let them but behold the character of their audience and the applause drown their echo in shame.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								DO THEY REALLY BELIEVE THEIR CLAIMS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, they but paint darkly their glasses with their sins of omission and deformed reason of arrogant ridicule.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT CAN I DO TO ENLIGHTEN SUCH A MAN?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Let him argue until he becomes hungry and thirsty. He will gently knock at thy door. Feed him just a little, and give him to drink with thy back turned. Then he, like some of my disciples, will follow thee as they didst me.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Never say: Thou shalt not do this. Ask: Why do ye this? Their silence is the answer, the affirmation of their guilt.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>There are no arguments, disputes or denials in one’s heart or mind when in the solitude of one's conscience. For their one is face to face with God.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, SHOULD PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Should children go to school?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD I GO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>If thou wouldst go is it to find me? If so, and I be with thee, must I follow thee if thou hast already found me?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT I AM SO ANXIOUS TO LEARN OF YOU.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Canst thou point out a worthy teacher to tell thee what they have read, and prove the truth, when thou hast the same privilege of assuming?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT THESE MEN SAY THEY OBEYED THEIR CALLING, THY VOICE IN THEIR HEARTS.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Hast not thou obeyed my whisper to thy soul, and as proof prophesied in my name? Have they all done these things?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT CAN WE BELIEVE IN OUR WORLDLY WAYS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>What do little children believe when they play with toys, dolls and horses, shadows of coming events.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT IS THE TRUEST RELIGION ON EARTH?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The highest divine principle and concept of a loving God and Father.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD WE STUDY THE BIBLE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>To what dost thou listen when thou hearest a love song from a loved one: the melody or words; the printed words of the Bible, or their true meaning?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								IS THE BIBLE A BOOK OF ALL TRUTH?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, what is the written opinion of wishful-thinking men, ill inspired by environments? Thou might ask me what is dirt? Then ask the blind worm that also claims a bible for worms. No absolute truth can ever be printed without a loss or deformity; for when written or printed it is dead, without life, with meaning only by the reflection of him who reads it.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, WHICH NATION OR RACE OF MEN HAVE THE TRUE RELIGION?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, ask each fruit of the world which fruit has the true seeds on earth? An apple may reply: I have, to be true to my creator as an apple.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THEN SHOULD WE COMBINE THEM ALL IN ONE FAITH OR BELIEF?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>If thou didst that, thou wouldst create hypocrites, liars, deceivers and sinners. For could a man believe something that has no meaning to him; or a tenor sing bass; a cruel murderer think the thoughts of a virgin? One should believe in that which he can worship in respect to better his morals and virtues.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								COULD WE CONVINCE THEM OF OUR WAY OF THINKING?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>How couldst thou &ndash; if an alter and method of thinking be inborn?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								ARE THEY INBORN?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Ask that question of an apple by trying to convince it that it should be a pear. Would its flavor change at its attempt?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THEN IT IS BEST FOR EACH TO HAVE ITS OWN CHURCH AND RELIGION.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Just as well as that each finger of thy hand should function as due its individuality.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WILL THE PRAYER OF A PAGAN BE HEARD?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>His soul must have been touched by God to have prayed at all, such as it was.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT ARE THEY CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE RIGHT?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Art thou, my son?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								I AM, MASTER.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thus shall they be when they reach the destination thou hast.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT ARE THEY NOT PRIMITIVE IN THEIR METHOD?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>What is man when he has only mastered the alphabet; and what good are words to thee if in a foreign tongue &ndash; whether curses, prayers or blessings?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT THEN SHALL ONE DO?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Be faithful to thy belief and respect theirs if orderly, until they ask thee to lend them thine own.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, STRENGTHEN MY FAITH!
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Can thy faith be any stronger than it is? Weaken thy doubt to know that strength.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								ONCE AGAIN I AM THRILLED BY YOUR NEARNESS!
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Then, my son come thou nearer to me in thought that gives birth to deeds to the fulfillment of the Law of God, the Prophets and my Shepherd, even as thou senseth.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THANK YOU, MASTER.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Peace, my son.</em>
