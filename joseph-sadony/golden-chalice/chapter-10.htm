								MASTER, WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES APPARENTLY TURN YOUR BACK TO ME?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, because I trust thee.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MY FRIEND SHOT HIMSELF TO DEATH.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Art thou certain that he destroyed himself after saving so many other lives? Or did his tired, weak body only hasten the soul's release.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								IS THERE NO HOPE FOR HIM FOR TAKING HIS LIFE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Hope is eternal, the child of faith where faith is the child of truth. Which was destroyed? Surely not the soul.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHY DO THEY DO THESE THINGS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The lack of faith where hope first was starved to death.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD I HAVE MORE HOPE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thy hope is unnecessary since thy faith has made thee whole. Does a man seek what he possesses, or hope still to find it?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								ARE WE ALL DOING OUR DUTIES?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Yes, save some mix a little different coal or green fuel to the fire, causing more smoke and longer to cook their meals, with sooty chimneys to clean occasionally.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO BETTER UNDERSTAND?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Pray to our heavenly Father for a little more light to read and understand a little better the signs under dark clouds of doubt and thoughtlessness.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HOW CAN ONE USE THE POWER OF PREVISION?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>By thinking of it.</em><em> And if forgotten, then 'tis still asleep beneath flesh, bone and blood: just as the ripe grape knows not the Spirit of Wine until fermented, and thus separated from material things.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HAVE WE ALL THIS POWER?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>If not, where was it hidden in my forefathers who did not reveal it as I did? They possessed it. Are not often brave heroes born of cowards? Why?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHY CAN WE NOT ALWAYS FEEL YOUR NEARNESS IN OUR PRAYERS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Try to ask for a favor when thou needest none; then when thy life depends on it. Is there a difference?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HOW OFTEN SHOULD ONE PRAY TO GOD?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>As often as thou art grateful to Him.</em><em> That alone is a prayer of thanksgiving.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HOW CAN WE BE TAUGHT HOW TO PRAY?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Ask that question of a newly born babe by observing who taught it to nurse from its mother's breast.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, SHOULD WE NOT OVERCOME SIN AND THUS CONQUER THE WORLD?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, conquer thyself. That is thy world. Instead of overcoming sin, let not sin overcome thee, by inviting it to a battle. It requires two to battle: thou and sin. Then why offer a challenge? Walk in the path of virtue.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT THERE ARE SO MANY PITFALLS.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Only to the blind who will not see.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HOW CAN WE OPEN THEIR EYES TO SEE?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>By not closing thine own.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HOW CAN WE INFLUENCE THEM TO SEE AND BE CONVINCED?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Man seeks what he cannot possess, and asks questions of him who can answer but doeth it slowly.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								SHOULD ONE HASTEN HIS EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, eternity is very long. Do thou things that last as long as thou wouldst possess them. The journey of labor up a high mountain is the same distance as the gliding down with little effort; as from childhood to manhood, and manhood to old age &ndash; with the same loss or profit.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC TIME TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Dost thou count thy heart-beats to see if there are any missing, or question the breath thou inhaleth? If not, who doeth these things for thee, if not the answer God giveth, and whose will be done?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THE DAYS SEEM SO SLOW AND WASTEFUL.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>But, my son, each moment that passes brings us closer in unity, each breath closer to eternal things to be recognized as thou approacheth my Father’s House as promised to my followers.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								ONCE AGAIN HAVE I TASTED OF SPIRITUAL FOOD.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>May it not be the Bread I did break at the last supper? Has it such a flavor?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, I AM NOT WORTHY BUT I SHALL TRY TO BE.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>(Note: NOT was changed from an obvious misprint of HOT in original book.) Thou hast said it, and I am well pleased to entrust to thee my faith and confidence. Thus prophets are subject to the prophets. Peace be with thee.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								AMEN
