								MASTER, I LOVE YOU!
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, that is the truth of the God thou seeketh. Fear nothing; and ever seek for those too blind to open their eyes and hearts so they too may love, to be loved.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHY ARE SOME MEN SO CRUEL?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, observe how they eat, and what; where they live, and how. See if a parallel with the animal: clever as a fox, cruel as a tiger, meek as a lamb, bold as a lion, faithful as a watch dog, keen-eyed as an eagle or as dangerous as a cobra. Make thy comparison and judge where the man really is.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT WHY?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Has he not absorbed all the things of earth that the animal has, retaining the characteristics of certain animals that make up his personality?</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT WHY THE SLOW PROGRESS?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, had man gazed upward instead of beneath him he would have seen the light where even the sun-worshipper without a teaching of God found Him in the light of the world.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WAS IT WRONG FOR THEM TO WORSHIP THE SUN?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>They were not shown the ten commandments; still they worshipped the kin of God, obeying a principle beyond their comprehension, a faith in the Power that be.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HOW SHALL WE KNOW AND FIND GOD?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Learn who created thee, and why. Then thou shalt be at His side.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT HOW?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Roll away thy animal years. Let thy soul stand naked. Then behold thy God in spirit.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT ONE SEEMS SO ALONE IN THIS SEARCH.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Canst thou not find the better what thou seeketh, away from the crowd that hampers thy efforts? Is it not a blessing to be all alone with thyself to study who thou art, and thy destiny? Wouldst thou follow the blind crowd into the pit of annihilation? Who were they that survived all the epidemics, pestilence, floods and fire up to date? Surely the survival of the intuitively fit.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHERE ARE THE TRUE, CHOSEN LEADERS OF GOD?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>They are hidden in every nation or group of men to perpetuate the truth even if it be in the seventh generation of their offspring, to avoid annihilation of the times.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								WHOM SHALL WE FOLLOW?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Take a long walk and see if thou art followed. For thou thyself may be the man chosen, or thou wouldst not walk with confidence and faith to a destination of hope.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								DEAR MASTER, MY EFFORTS SEEM SO HOPELESS AND SLOW.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>'Tis thy intellect, not thy faith, that judges that.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								I WISH I WERE MORE WORTHY!
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thou art.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT I CAN'T SEE IT.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>'Tis all the more credit that thou dost not count thy wealth.</em><em> 'Tis often vanity to do so.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								HOW WILL I KNOW I AM DOING RIGHT?
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>By not trying to know, but only to do.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								BUT IT SEEMS SO LITTLE.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>My son, let me judge that. And let thy prayers guide thee in confidence.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								MASTER, I SHALL DO AS YOU COMMAND.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>'Tis not a command, but only a favor to me.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THEN PLEASE IMPRESS ME AS TO YOUR WISH.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>'Tis already done.</em><em> Observe thy returns shortly, and build upon it a stronger structure of security in the eyes of friends, strangers and enemies.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								THANK YOU, MASTER. I WILL.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Bless thee, my son, with Peace.</em>
