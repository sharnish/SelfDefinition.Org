                                Good sir, have you not yet caught sight of the one who has broken off his pursuit of knowledge, seeks no goals and now leisurely walks the Way?</p>
                            <p>
                                He does not try to exclude from his mind foolish or deluded thoughts nor does he hunt after Truth,</p>
                            <p>
                                For the real nature of his ignorance is none other than Buddha Nature</p>
                            <p>
                                And his illusory, ever-changing body, empty of any permanent self, is none other than the Dharma Body.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Once we have realized what the Dharma Body is, not a single thing exists that we can call "our own"</p>
                            <p>
                                For our original Self-nature is this Buddha of Ultimate Reality.</p>
                            <p>
                                Our five skandhas are as floating clouds, vainly coming and going,</p>
                            <p>
                                And the three poisons of greed, hatred and delusion are as water bubbles which emerge and disappear to no purpose.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Once we have awakened to That Which Is Real, "persons" and "things" no longer exist</p>
                            <p>
                                And, in a second, the karma that has been dragging us through the incessant torments of avichi<sup> *</sup> hells dissolves into thin air.</p>
                            <p class="fnote">
                                * lowest level</p>

                                But, were we then to deceive any sentient being with false words and claims,</p>
                            <p>
                                We would incur having our tongues ripped out in aeons of future lives as uncountable as dust grains in the universe.</p>

                                Upon our sudden awakening to the meditation of a Tathagata</p>
                            <p>
                                Our myriad practices of the six paramitas are perfected within that essential state.</p>
                            <p>
                                Whilst we are within that dream called life, the six realms of existence are all too clear;</p>
                            <p>
                                After awakening, the great universe of universes is completely empty of any substantiality.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Therein are no defilements or blessings, loss or gain,</p>
                            <p>
                                For, within our Original Nature, serene and free of defiling passions, there is no need to raise questions or search for anything</p>
                            <p>
                                And, as the mirror of mind which is covered with the dust of age-old ignorance has not yet been wiped clear,</p>
                            <p>
                                Now is the day to be scrupulous in our cleansing of it.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Who is beyond thought? Who beyond birth?</p>

                                If truly there is the Unborn, then there is not anything that is not born of It.</p>
                            <p>
                                Summon up your mechanical man, the one with the wooden head, and ask him</p>
                            <p>
                                How soon in his search for Buddhahood he will attain his goal through his kind of efforts.
                            </p>

                                Let the four elements go free; do not grasp after them.</p>

                                Acting from within your serene and defilement-free Nature take what you need of food and drink;</p>
                            <p>
                                For all your actions lack any permanence, are empty of any substantiality,</p>
                            <p>
                                And are nothing but the great, perfect, enlightened understanding of the Tathagata.</p>

                                Those who are given to disagreeing display signs of emotional commitments.</p>
                            <p>
                                The direct severing of the roots of karma is what a Buddha attests to with His seal;</p>
                            <p>
                                If you just pick at the leaves or search for the branches, I cannot help you.</p>

                                The whereabouts of the Mani-pearl is beyond the ken of ordinary people</p>

                                But you can find It for yourself within the Tathagata's Treasure House which is within your own being.</p>
                            <p>
                                Its wondrous spiritual functioning through your six senses will be both empty and not empty</p>
                            <p>
                                And the halo of light of Its manifestation will take forms and be beyond form.</p>

                                But it is only after you have attested to It for yourself that you will truly know how unfathomable It is;</p>

                                But, if you grasp at the moon in the water, how will you succeed in taking hold of it?</p>

                                His tune is an ancient one, his spirit pure, his temperament naturally elevated;</p>

                                Gaunt of countenance, sturdy of bone, he does not turn back to give others a second look.

                                For within his Essential Nature the threefold Buddha body and the four forms of Buddha wisdom have been perfected</p>

                                Whilst the eight forms of liberation and the six wondrous spiritual abilities are the seal that attests to his training.</p>

                                But the Buddhas as uncountable as sand grains are, in essence, the same.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Speak with the fearlessness of a roaring lion</p>
                            <p>
                                And all the beasts, upon hearing it, will be boggled out of their minds;</p>
                            <p>
                                The elephant, fragrant with springtime passions, may lose his dignity and composure as he thunders about like a restless surf</p>
                            <p>
                                But the devas and nagas, tranquilly listening, will beget joy and delight.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Travelling the broad rivers and seas, fording the mountain streams,</p>
                            <p>
                                I sought out teachers, inquired about the Way and challenged the understanding of Masters,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, ever since I found the pathway of Hui-neng,</p>
                            <p>
                                I have thoroughly understood that the issue of birth and death is not necessarily involved with such activities.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Meditating whilst active as well as meditating whilst sitting,</p>
                            <p>
                                Whether speaking or silent, moving about or inactive, my Self-nature is quiet and tranquil.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Should I happen to encounter those with swords or daggers, It will continue ever-peaceful</p>
                            <p>
                                Or, were I to be poisoned by some drug, again It will remain at Its ease.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                In a former life our Master Shakyamuni attended on His twenty-fourth predecessor, Dipankara Buddha,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, after many kalpas, He trained Himself as the holy ascetic who patiently experienced mutilation in order to convert King Kali.</p>
                            <p>
                                How many rounds of birth, how many rounds of death He passed through!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                His births and deaths were unbounded whilst He remained uncertain when they would end
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Until He Himself suddenly awoke to fully know the Unborn.</p>
                            <p>
                                For, in the midst of all the struggles and rebuffs of life, what are momentary grief and pleasure?</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Entering deep into the mountains to abide in a forest,</p>
                            <p>
                                As isolated and remote as the mountain peaks, under some tall pine tree I have taken my place,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Strolling about or tranquilly sitting with my family of rustic monks.</p>
                            <p>
                                Silent in our solitude, we peacefully dwell together through the rainy season, truly solitary and unattached.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Once you have fully and completely awakened, there is no striving after things
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For none of the things of worldly purpose and common value is the same as this.</p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, with an eye on your condition in life, to practise charity in order to beget celestial blessings and auspicious fortune</p>
                            <p>
                                Is no different than shooting an arrow into the heavens.</p>
                            <p>
                                For, once its potential power is spent, your arrow merely falls back to earth</p>
                            <p>
                                And what you will receive in future lives will not be what you desire.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                What resemblance does this kind of behaviour bear to that gate to Reality which is the breaking free from entanglement with the every-day world's sense of worth?</p>
                            <p>
                                Once you have crossed over that threshold, straightway you enter the Tathagata's realm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Therefore, simply get to the root of the matter; do not worry yourself over the new shoots that branch out atop the tree.</p>
                            <p>
                                It is just as the clearest porcelain holding within itself the Precious Moon.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                I now understand what the so-called Wish-granting Jewel is:</p>
                            <p>
                                It is our seeking spiritual benefits for ourselves that we might spiritually benefit others without surcease.</p>
                            <p>
                                Within the river the luminous moon floats; among the branches of the pine the wind blows softly,</p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout the long night the dark sky is clear - what is there that needs to be done?
                            </p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                The Precepts, the Buddha Nature's pearis, are imbedded upon the very ground of my heart,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Frost and dew, clouds and mist, are the raiment of my Original Self.</p>
                            <p>
                                Coaxing dragons into one's begging bowl, pacifying quarrelsome tigers with one's travelling staff</p>
                            <p>
                                Whose jangling metal rings clearly resound</p>
                            <p>
                                Are not mere conventional metaphors for dutifully conforming to the Precepts,</p>
                            <p>
                                But are the very leaning on the Tathagata's precious staff and the walking in His traces.
                            </p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                It is not a matter of seeking Truth or cutting off false views,</p>
                            <p>
                                Just fully understand that dualities are void of meaningfulness and have no reality of their own.</p>
                            <p>
                                To be beyond form is to be beyond emptiness and beyond being not empty;</p>
                            <p>
                                This is precisely what the genuine form of a Tathagata is.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                His Original Nature is as a mirror bright, a looking-glass without obstructing blemishes,</p>
                            <p>
                                Its vastness and clarity permeate realms as numerous as the Ganges River sands.</p>
                            <p>
                                The whole universe and all that it contains are but silhouettes reflected within It.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The halo of light of Its manifestation has no duality of outside and within.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Vacant-headed notions of emptiness which deny causality</p>
                            <p>
                                Bring about calamities as dire as a raging conflagration or a rampaging flood.</p>
                            <p>
                                Rejecting that anything exists whilst clutching on to emptiness is a sickness and a fever</p>
                            <p>
                                And is no better than avoiding drowning by throwing oneself onto a fire.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                If someone tries to discard his deluded mind in order to snatch at the True Principle,</p>
                            <p>
                                His mind, given over to the duality of grasping and abandoning, will become a clever and deceiving cheat.</p>
                            <p>
                                The novice who has not yet comprehended this needs to train;</p>
                            <p>
                                When he has deeply perfected himself, he will recognise this thief which he was wont to take for his True Child.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                The loss of the Dharma's wealth and the destruction of merits and virtues</p>
                            <p>
                                Invariably come about through the wilful and conscious indulgence of the discriminatory mind;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Therefore the gate to meditation is the complete dropping off of discriminatory thoughts,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whereby you will suddenly awaken to the ability to know and see for yourself the Unborn.

                                The one of great zeal holds within his hands the sword of wise discrimination;</p>

                                This weapon of wisdom is the very flame that springs forth from the indestructible Jewel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not only does it utterly smash the mind-sets of those outside the Way
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It also has, for ever so long, discouraged the boldness of those demons who reside in heavens.</p>

                                He sets the thunder of the Teaching to vibrating, strikes the drum of the Dharma,

                                Though you may search for it in me, know, good sir, it is beyond sight.</p>
                            <p>
                                It cannot be grabbed onto nor can it be removed.</p>
                            <p>
                                Only within the Unattainable is it to be realized.</p>
                            <p>
                                When I am silent it speaks, when I speak it is silent;</p>
                            <p>
                                The great gate of its charity is open wide, nothing bars the way.</p>

                                When people ask me what the Principle is that I expound,</p>

                                I respond that it is the power of Mahaprajna, the Great Wisdom,</p>

                                But, whether they say yea or nay, it is beyond their ken</p>
                            <p>
                                For, whether they resist it or walk in compliance with it, it is even beyond heaven to fathom.</p>
                            <p>
                                For too many kalpas have I trained myself in it</p>
                            <p>
                                For this to be some idle boast or attempt at deception or delusion.</p>

                                By hoisting up the standard of Buddha Truth in order to establish the Principle for which we train</p>

                                Hui-neng did what Buddha decreed and ever so brilliantly.</p>

                                The first to Transmit the Lamp was Mahakashyapa,</p>

                                Then, through twenty-eight generations in India, It was kept burning in memory</p>
                            <p>
                                Until the Dharma flowed east and entered this land.</p>

                                Bodhidharma was our First Ancestor</p>

                                And for six generations the Kesa has been Transmitted as people have heard.</p>

                                So, when the duality of existence and non-existence is altogether banished, then even non-emptiness is a vain term.</p>

                                The twenty gates to Emptiness are, from the start, non-attachment;</p>

                                The mind is a sense organ, dharmas are its objects;</p>

                                Both are just as dark smudges upon a mirror.</p>

                                Once such dirt spots are completely removed, its light, for the first time, is fully revealed.

                                When both mind and dharmas are forgotten about, one's Nature is the Truth.</p>

                            <p>
                                Such a person would not fail to offer the four essentials of clothing, food, bedding and medicine,</p>
                            <p>
                                To say nothing of dispersing ten thousand ounces of gold where needed.</p>
                            <p>
                                To have one's body crushed and bones reduced to powder is not sufficient to repay him,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For one verse, clearly explained, surpasses ten million merely mouthed.</p>
                            <p>
                                He is a lord amidst the Dharma deserving of highest respect,</p>
                            <p>
                                And Tathagatas, as numberless as the sands of the Ganges, are alike in their attesting to what he has attained.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                Now, comprehending what this Wish-granting Jewel is,</p>
                            <p>
                                I know that those who have accepted It in true faith are all in accord with It.</p>
                            <p>
                                Such a one clearly sees that not a single thing substantially exists,</p>
                            <p>
                                That there are neither ordinary people nor Buddhas,</p>
                            <p>
                                That the great thousandfold universes, containing worlds as numerous as the grains of sand, are as bubbles within the ocean</p>
                            <p>
                                And that all saints and sages are as lightning sweeping across the sky.</p>
                            <p>
                                Even if an iron wheel were sent spinning above his head,</p>
                            <p>
                                The perfect brilliance of his meditation and wisdom would never be lost.</p>
                            <p class="newparagraph">
                                The sun can grow cold, the moon can turn hot,</p>
                            <p>
                                But the host of Mara's demons cannot destroy the true speech of such a one.</p>
                            <p>
                                Like a lofty elephant drawing a carriage slowly along the road,</p>
                            <p>
                                What praying mantis can stop his turning of the Wheel?</p>
                            <p>
                                The lordly elephant does not wander about in the rabbit's trails;</p>
                            <p>
                                One of great awakening does not adhere to petty formalisms.</p>
                            <p>
                                Do not malign the blue heavens as you peer at them through a slender, hollow reed.</p>
                            <p>
                                Since you may not yet have comprehended, I have now, for your sake, good sir, given you here my parting words as a key.</p>
