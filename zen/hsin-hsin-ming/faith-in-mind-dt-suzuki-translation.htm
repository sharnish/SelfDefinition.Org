                                The Perfect Way knows no difficulties
                                <br />
                                Except that it refuses to make preference:
                                <br />
                                Only when freed from hate and love,
                                <br />
                                It reveals itself fully and without disguise.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A tenth of an inch's difference,
                                <br />
                                And heaven and earth are set apart:
                                <br />
                                If you want to see it manifest,
                                <br />
                                Take no thought either for or against it.

                            <p>
                                To set up what you like against what you dislike –
                                <br />
                                This is the disease of the mind:
                                <br />
                                When the deep meaning [of the Way] is not understood
                                <br />
                                Peace of mind is disturbed and nothing is gained.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                [The Way is] perfect like unto vast space,
                                <br />
                                With nothing wanting, nothing superfluous:
                                <br />
                                It is indeed due to making choice
                                <br />
                                That its suchness is lost sight of.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pursue not the outer entanglements,
                                <br />
                                Dwell not in the inner void;
                                <br />
                                When the mind rests serene in the oneness of things,
                                <br />
                                The dualism vanishes by itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you strive to gain quiescence by stopping motion,
                                <br />
                                The quiescence thus gained is ever in motion;
                                <br />
                                As long as you tarry in the dualism,
                                <br />
                                How can you realize oneness?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And when oneness is not thoroughly understood,
                                <br />
                                In two ways loss is sustained –
                                <br />
                                The denial of reality may lead to its absolute negation,
                                <br />
                                While the upholding of the void may result in contradicting itself.
                                <br />
                                Wordiness and intellection –
                                <br />
                                The more with them the further astray we go;
                                <br />
                                Away therefore with wordiness and intellection,
                                <br />
                                And there is no place where we cannot pass freely.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When we return to the root, we gain the meaning;
                                <br />
                                When we pursue external objects, we lose the reason.
                                <br />
                                The moment we are enlightened within,
                                <br />
                                We go beyond the voidness of a world confronting us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Transformations going on in an empty world which confronts us,
                                <br />
                                Appear real all because of Ignorance:
                                <br />
                                Try not to seek after the true,
                                <br />
                                Only cease to cherish opinions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tarry not with dualism,
                                <br />
                                Carefully avoid pursuing it;
                                <br />
                                As soon as you have right and wrong,
                                <br />
                                Confusion ensues, and mind is lost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The two exist because of the one,
                                <br />
                                But hold not even to this one;
                                <br />
                                When the one mind is not disturbed,
                                <br />
                                The ten thousand things offer no offence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When no offence is offered by them, they are as if not existing;
                                <br />
                                When the mind is not disturbed, it is as if there is no mind.
                                <br />
                                The subject is quieted as the object ceases,
                                <br />
                                The object ceases as the subject is quieted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The object is an object for the subject,
                                <br />
                                The subject is a subject for an object:
                                <br />
                                Know that the relativity of the two
                                <br />
                                Rests ultimately on the oneness of the void.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the oneness of the void the two are one,
                                <br />
                                And each of the two contains in itself all the ten thousand things:
                                <br />
                                When no discrimination is made between this and that,
                                <br />
                                How can a one-sided and prejudiced view arise?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Great Way is calm and large-minded,
                                <br />
                                Nothing is easy, nothing is hard:
                                <br />
                                Small views are irresolute,
                                <br />
                                The more in haste the tardier they go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clinging never keeps itself within bounds,
                                <br />
                                It is sure to go the wrong way:
                                <br />
                                Let go loose, and things are as they may be,
                                <br />
                                While the essence neither departs nor abides.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Obey the nature of things, and you are in concord with the Way,
                                <br />
                                Calm and easy and free from annoyance;
                                <br />
                                But when your thoughts are tied, you turn away from the truth,
                                <br />
                                They grow heavier and duller and are not at all sound.

                            <p>
                                When they are not sound, the soul is troubled;

                                What is the use of being partial and one-sided then?

                                If you want to walk the course of the One Vehicle,

                                When you are not prejudiced against the six sense-objects,
                                <br />
                                You in turn identify yourself with Enlightenment;

                                The wise are non-active,
                                <br />
                                While the ignorant bind themselves up;
                                <br />
                                While in the Dharma itself there is no individuation,
                                <br />
                                They ignorantly attach themselves to particular objects.
                                <br />
                                It is their own mind that creates illusions –
                                <br />
                                Is this not the greatest of self-contradictions?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ignorance begets the dualism of rest and unrest,
                                <br />
                                The enlightened have no likes and dislikes:
                                <br />
                                All forms of dualism
                                <br />
                                Are ignorantly contrived by the mind itself.
                                <br />
                                They are like unto visions and flowers in the air:
                                <br />
                                Why should we trouble ourselves to take hold of them?
                                <br />
                                Gain and loss, right and wrong –
                                <br />
                                Away with them once for all!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If an eye never falls asleep,
                                <br />
                                All dreams will by themselves cease:
                                <br />
                                If the mind retains its oneness,
                                <br />
                                The ten thousand things are of one suchness.
                                <br />
                                When the deep mystery of one suchness is fathomed,
                                <br />
                                All of a sudden we forget the external entanglements:
                                <br />
                                When the ten thousand things are viewed in their oneness,
                                <br />
                                We return to the origin and remain what we are.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Forget the wherefore of things,
                                <br />
                                And we attain to a state beyond analogy:
                                <br />
                                Movement stopped is no movement,
                                <br />
                                And rest set in motion is no rest.
                                <br />
                                When dualism does no more obtain,
                                <br />
                                Even oneness itself remains not as such.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ultimate end of things where they cannot go any further,
                                <br />
                                Is not bound by rules and measures:
                                <br />
                                The mind in harmony [with the Way] is the principle of identity
                                <br />
                                In which we find all doings in a quiescent state;
                                <br />
                                Irresolutions are completely done away with,
                                <br />
                                And the right faith is restored to its native straightness;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nothing is retained now,
                                <br />
                                Nothing is to be memorized,
                                <br />
                                All is void, lucid, and self-illuminating,
                                <br />
                                There is no stain, no exertion, no wasting of energy –
                                <br />
                                This is where thinking never attains,
                                <br />
                                This is where the imagination fails to measure.

                            <p>

                                There is neither "other" nor "self":
                                <br />
                                When a direct identification is asked for,
                                <br />
                                We can only say, "Not two."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In being not two all is the same,

                                All that is is comprehended in it:

                                The wise in the ten quarters,

                                They all enter into this absolute faith.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This absolute faith is beyond quickening [time] and extension [space].
                                <br />
                                One instant is ten thousand years;

                                No matter how things are conditioned, whether with "to be" or "not to be",

                                It is manifest everywhere before you

                                Be sure not to tarry.

                                If only this is realized;

                                This is where words fail,
