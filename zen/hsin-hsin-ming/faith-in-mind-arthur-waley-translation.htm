                                The Perfect Way is only difficult for those who pick and choose;
                                <br />
                                Do not like, do not dislike; all will then be clear.
                                <br />
                                Make a hairbreadth difference, and Heaven and Earth are set apart;
                                <br />
                                If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The struggle between &quot;for&quot; and &quot;against&quot; is the mind's worst disease;
                                <br />
                                While the deep meaning is misunderstood, it is useless to meditate on Rest.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It [the Buddha-nature] is blank and featureless as space; it has no &quot;too little&quot; or &quot;too much;&quot;
                                <br />
                                Only because we take and reject does it seem to us not to be so.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do not chase after Entanglements as though they were real things,
                                <br />
                                Do not try to drive pain away by pretending that it is not real;
                                <br />
                                Pain, if you seek serenity in Oneness, will vanish of its own accord.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stop all movement in order to get rest, and rest will itself be restless;
                                <br />
                                Linger over either extreme, and Oneness is for ever lost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Those who cannot attain to Oneness in either case will fail:
                                <br />
                                To banish Reality is to sink deeper into the Real;
                                <br />
                                Allegiance to the Void implies denial of its voidness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The more you talk about It, the more you think about It, the further from It you go;
                                <br />
                                Stop talking, stop thinking, and there is nothing you will not understand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Return to the Root and you will find the Meaning;
                                <br />
                                Pursue the Light, and you will lose its source,
                                <br />
                                Look inward, and in a flash you will conquer the Apparent and the Void.
                                <br />
                                For the whirligigs of Apparent and Void all come from mistaken views;
                                <br />
                                There is no need to seek Truth; only stop having views.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do not accept either position [Assertion and Negation], examine it or pursue it;
                                <br />
                                At the least thought of &quot;Is&quot; and &quot;Isn't&quot; there is chaos and the Mind is lost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though the two exist because of the One, do not cling to the One;
                                <br />
                                Only when no thought arises are the Dharmas without blame.
                                <br />
                                No blame, no Dharmas; no arising, not thought.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The doer vanishes along with the deed,
                                <br />
                                The deed disappears when the doer is annihilated.
                                <br />
                                The deed has no function apart from the doer;
                                <br />
                                The doer has no function apart from the deed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ultimate Truth about both Extremes is that they are One Void.
                                <br />
                                In that One Void the two are not distinguished;
                                <br />
                                Each contains complete within itself the Ten Thousand Forms.
                                <br />
                                Only if we boggle over fine and coarse are we tempted to take sides.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In its essence the Great Way is all embracing;
                                <br />
                                It is as wrong to call it easy as to call it hard.
                                <br />
                                Partial views are irresolute and insecure,
                                <br />
                                Now at a gallop, now lagging in the rear.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clinging to this or to that beyond measure
                                <br />
                                The heart trusts to bypaths that lead it astray.
                                <br />
                                Let things take their own course; know that the Essence will neither go nor stay;
                                <br />
                                Let your nature blend with the Way and wander in it free from care.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thoughts that are fettered turn from Truth,
                                <br />
                                Sink into the unwise habit of &quot;not liking.&quot;
                                <br />
                                &quot;Not liking&quot; brings weariness of spirit; estrangements serve no purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you want to follow the doctrine of the One, do not rage against the World of the Senses.
                                <br />
                                Only by accepting the World of the Senses can you share in the True Perception.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Those who know most, do least; folly ties its own bonds.
                                <br />
                                In the Dharma there are no separate dharmas, only the foolish cleave
                                <br />
                                To their own preferences and attachments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To use Thought to devise thoughts, what more misguided than this?
                                <br />
                                Ignorance creates Rest and Unrest; Wisdom neither loves nor hates.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All that belongs to the Two Extremes is inference falsely drawn -
                                <br />
                                A dream-phantom, a flower in the air. Why strive to grasp it in the hand?
                                <br />
                                &quot;Is&quot; and &quot;Isn't,&quot; gain and loss banish once for all:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the eyes do not close in sleep there can be no evil dreams;
                                <br />
                                If the mind makes no distinctions all Dharmas become one.
                                <br />
                                Let the One with its mystery blot out all memory of complications.
                                <br />
                                Let the thought of the Dharmas as All-One bring you to the So-in-itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus their origin is forgotten and nothing is left to make us pit one against the other.
                                <br />
                                Regard motion as though it were stationary, and what becomes of motion?
                                <br />
                                Treat the stationary as though it moved, and that disposes of the stationary.
                                <br />
                                Both these having thus been disposed of, what becomes of the One?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the ultimate point, beyond which you can go no further,
                                <br />
