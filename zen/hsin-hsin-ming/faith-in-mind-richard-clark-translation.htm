                                The Great Way is not difficult
                                <br />
                                for those who have no preferences.
                                <br />
                                When love and hate are both absent
                                <br />
                                everything becomes clear and undisguised.
                                <br />
                                Make the smallest distinction, however
                                <br />
                                and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.
                                <br />
                                If you wish to see the truth
                                <br />
                                then hold no opinions for or against anything.
                                <br />
                                To set up what you like against what you dislike
                                <br />
                                is the disease of the mind.
                                <br />
                                When the deep meaning of things is not understood
                                <br />
                                the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Way is perfect like vast space
                                <br />
                                where nothing is lacking and nothing is in excess.
                                <br />
                                Indeed, it is due to our choosing to accept or reject
                                <br />
                                that we do not see the true nature of things.
                                <br />
                                Live neither in the entanglements of outer things,
                                <br />
                                nor in inner feelings of emptiness.
                                <br />
                                Be serene in the oneness of things
                                <br />
                                and such erroneous views will disappear by themselves.
                                <br />
                                When you try to stop activity to achieve passivity
                                <br />
                                your very effort fills you with activity.
                                <br />
                                As long as you remain in one extreme or the other
                                <br />
                                you will never know Oneness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Those who do not live in the single Way
                                <br />
                                fail in both activity and passivity,
                                <br />
                                assertion and denial. To deny the reality of things
                                <br />
                                to assert the emptiness of things is to miss their reality.
                                <br />
                                The more you talk and think about it,
                                <br />
                                the further astray you wander from the truth.
                                <br />
                                Stop talking and thinking,
                                <br />
                                and there is nothing you will not be able to know.
                                <br />
                                To return to the root is to find the meaning,
                                <br />
                                but to pursue appearances is to miss the source.
                                <br />
                                At the moment of inner enlightenment
                                <br />
                                there is a going beyond appearance and emptiness.
                                <br />
                                The changes that appear to occur in the empty world
                                <br />
                                we call real only because of our ignorance.
                                <br />
                                Do not search for the truth;
                                <br />
                                only cease to cherish opinions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do not remain in the dualistic state
                                <br />
                                avoid such pursuits carefully.
                                <br />
                                If there is even a trace of this and that, of right and wrong,
                                <br />
                                the Mind-essence will be lost in confusion.
                                <br />
                                Although all dualities come from the One,
                                <br />
                                do not be attached even to this One.
                                <br />
                                When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way,
                                <br />
                                nothing in the world can offend,
                                <br />
                                and when a thing can no longer offend, it ceases to exist in the old way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When no discriminating thoughts arise, the old mind ceases to exist.
                                <br />
                                When thought objects vanish, the thinking-subject vanishes,
                                <br />
                                as when the mind vanishes, objects vanish.
                                <br />
                                Things are objects because of the subject (mind);
                                <br />
                                the mind (subject) is such because of things (object).
                                <br />
                                Understand the relativity of these two
                                <br />
                                and the basic reality: the unity of emptiness.
                                <br />
                                In this Emptiness the two are indistinguishable
                                <br />
                                and each contains in itself the whole world.
                                <br />
                                If you do not discriminate between coarse and fine
                                <br />
                                you will not be tempted to prejudice and opinion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To live in the Great Way
                                <br />
                                is neither easy nor difficult,
                                <br />
                                but those with limited views
                                <br />
                                and fearful and irresolute: the faster they hurry, the slower they go,
                                <br />
                                and clinging (attachment) cannot be limited;
                                <br />
                                even to be attached to the idea of enlightenment is to go astray.
                                <br />
                                Just let things be in their own way
                                <br />
                                and there will be neither coming nor going.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Obey the nature of things (your own nature),
                                <br />
                                and you will walk freely and undisturbed.
                                <br />
                                When thought is in bondage the truth is hidden,
                                <br />
                                for everything is murky and unclear,
                                <br />
                                and the burdensome practice of judging brings annoyance and weariness.
                                <br />
                                What benefit can be derived from distinctions and separations?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you wish to move in the One Way
                                <br />
                                do not dislike even the world of senses and ideas.
                                <br />
                                Indeed, to accept them fully
                                <br />
                                is identical with true Enlightenment.
                                <br />
                                The wise man strives to no goals
                                <br />
                                but the foolish man fetters himself.
                                <br />
                                This is one Dharma, not many: distinctions arise
                                <br />
                                from the clinging needs of the ignorant.
                                <br />
                                To seek Mind with the (discriminating) mind
                                <br />
                                is the greatest of all mistakes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rest and unrest derive from illusion;
                                <br />
                                with enlightenment there is no liking and disliking.
                                <br />
                                All dualities come from ignorant inference.
                                <br />
                                They are like dreams of flowers in the air:
                                <br />
                                foolish to try to grasp them.
                                <br />
                                Gain and loss, right and wrong:
                                <br />
                                such thoughts must finally be abolished at once.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the eye never sleeps,
                                <br />
                                all dreams will naturally cease.
                                <br />
                                If the mind makes no discriminations,
                                <br />
                                the ten thousand things are as they are, of single essence.
                                <br />
                                To understand the mystery of this One-essence
                                <br />
                                is to be released from all entanglements.
                                <br />
                                When all things are seen equally
                                <br />
                                the timeless Self-essence is reached.
                                <br />
                                No comparisons or analogies are possible
                                <br />
                                in this causeless, relationless state.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Consider movement stationary and the stationary in motion,
                                <br />
                                both movement and rest disappear.
                                <br />
                                When such dualities cease to exist
                                <br />
                                Oneness itself cannot exist.
                                <br />
                                To this ultimate finality
                                <br />
                                no law or description applies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the unified mind in accord with the Way
                                <br />
                                all self-centered straining ceases.
                                <br />
                                Doubts and irresolution's vanish
                                <br />
                                and life in true faith is possible.
                                <br />
                                With a single stroke we are freed from bondage;
                                <br />
                                nothing clings to us and we hold to nothing.
                                <br />
                                All is empty, clear, self-illuminating,
                                <br />
                                with no exertion of the mind's power.
                                <br />
                                Here thought, feeling, knowledge, and imagination are of no value.
                                <br />
                                In this world of Suchness
                                <br />
                                there is neither self nor other-than-self
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To come directly into harmony with this reality
                                <br />
                                just simply say when doubt arises, 'Not two.'
                                <br />
                                In this 'no two' nothing is separate,
                                <br />
                                nothing excluded.
                                <br />
                                No matter when or where,
                                <br />
                                enlightenment means entering this truth.
                                <br />
                                And this truth is beyond extension or diminution in time or space;
                                <br />
                                in it a single thought is ten thousand years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Emptiness here, Emptiness there,
                                <br />
                                but the infinite universe stands always before your eyes.
                                <br />
                                Infinitely large and infinitely small;
                                <br />
                                no difference, for definitions have vanished
                                <br />
                                and no boundaries are seen.
                                <br />
                                So too with Being
                                <br />
                                and non-Being.
                                <br />
                                Don't waste time in doubts and arguments
                                <br />
                                that have nothing to do with this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One thing, all things:
                                <br />
                                move among and intermingle, without distinction.
                                <br />
                                To live in this realization
                                <br />
                                is to be without anxiety about non-perfection.
                                <br />
                                To live in this faith is the road to non-duality,
                                <br />
                                Because the non-dual is one with the trusting mind. Words! The Way is beyond language,
                                <br />
                                for in it there is
                                <br />
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;no yesterday
