                                <br />
                                for those who have no preferences.
                                <br />
                                Let go of longing and aversion,

                                and it reveals itself.

                            <p>
                                Make the smallest distinction, however,

                                and you are as far from it as heaven is from earth.

                                If you want to realize the truth,

                                then hold no opinions for or against anything.

                                is the disease of the mind.

                                When the deep meaning (of the Way) is not understood

                                the intrinsic peace of mind is disturbed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As vast as infinite space,

                                it is perfect and lacks nothing.
                                <br />
                                Indeed, it is due to your grasping and repelling
                                <br />
                                That you do not see things as they are.

                            <p>
                                Do not get entangled in things;

                                Do not get lost in emptiness.
                                <br />
                                Be still in the oneness of things

                                and dualism vanishes by itself.

                                the very effort fills you with activity.
                                <br />
                                As long as you hold on to opposites
                                <br />
                                you will never know the One Way.

                            <p>

                                will assert or deny the reality of things.
                                <br />
                                Deny the reality of things, you miss its deeper reality;
                                <br />
                                Assert the reality of things, you miss the emptiness of all things.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The more you think about it,
                                <br />
                                the further you are from the truth.
                                <br />
                                Cease all thinking,
                                <br />
                                and there is nothing that will not be revealed to you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To return to the root is to find the essence,
                                <br />
                                but to pursue appearances is to miss the Source.
                                <br />
                                The moment you are enlightened,
                                <br />
                                you go beyond appearances and emptiness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Changes that seem to occur in the (empty) world,
                                <br />
                                appear real only because of ignorance.
                                <br />
                                Do not search for the truth;
                                <br />
                                only cease to cherish opinions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do not hold to dualistic views,
                                <br />
                                avoid such habits carefully.
                                <br />
                                If there is even a trace of right and wrong,
                                <br />
                                the mind is lost in confusion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although all dualities arise from the One,
                                <br />
                                do not cling even to this One.
                                <br />
                                When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way,
                                <br />
                                everything is without fault.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When things can no longer be faulty, it is as if there are no things.
                                <br />
                                When the mind can no longer be disturbed, it is as if there is no mind.
                                <br />
                                When thought-objects vanish, the thinking-subject vanishes.
                                <br />
                                When the mind vanishes, objects vanish.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The arising of other gives rise to self;
                                <br />
                                giving rise to self generates other.
                                <br />
                                Know these seeming two facets
                                <br />
                                as one Emptiness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this Emptiness, the two are indistinguishable
                                <br />
                                and each contains in itself the whole.
                                <br />
                                When no discrimination is made between this and that,
                                <br />
                                how can you prefer one to another?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Great Way is all-embracing,
                                <br />
                                not easy, not difficult.
                                <br />
                                Those who rely on limited views are fearful and irresolute;
                                <br />
                                the faster they hurry, the slower they go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clinging, they go too far,
                                <br />
                                even an attachment to enlightenment is to go astray.
                                <br />
                                Just let things be in their own way as they are,
                                <br />
                                and there is neither coming nor going.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Be in harmony with the Way
                                <br />
                                and you will be free of disturbances.
                                <br />
                                Tied by your thoughts, you lose the truth,
                                <br />
                                become heavy, dull, and unwell.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not well, the mind is troubled.

                                Then why cling to or reject anything?

                                If you wish to move in the One Way,

                                do not dislike even the world of senses and ideas.

                                is identical with true Enlightenment.

                                The wise attaches to no goals,

                                Distinctions arise from the clinging needs of the ignorant.

                                Using mind to stir up the mind

                                is the original mistake.

                                Enlightenment has no likes or dislikes.

                                All dualities come from

                                ignorant inference.

                                They are like unto dreams or flowers in the air,

                                the foolish try to grasp them.

                                Gain and loss, right and wrong,

                                abandon all such thoughts at once.

                                all dreams will naturally cease.

                                If the mind makes no discriminations,

                                all things are as they are, of One-essence.

                                is to be released from all entanglements.

                                When all things are seen without differentiation,

                                you return to the origin and remain what you are.

                                Consider the movement in stillness and the stationary in motion,

                                both movement and rest disappear.

                                When such dualities cease to exist

                                even Oneness itself cannot exist.

                                With a single stroke you are freed from bondage;

                                nothing clings to you and you hold onto nothing.

                                    This interpretation was created by studying and comparing translations by Richard B. Clarke, Dusan Pajin, D.T. Suzuki, R.H. Blyth, Robert F. Olson, Christmas Humphreys, and Stanley Lombardo...and my own understanding and realization.</p>

                                    The Hsin Hsin Ming (Shinjinmei in Japanese) is a verse attributed to the Third Chinese Chan (Zen) Patriarch Seng’tsan (known as Sosan in Japan). Written in the 6th century, it is considered the first clear and comprehensive statement of Zen.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The title is often translated as "Faith in Mind", but John McRae argues that the title should be translated as "Inscription on Relying on the Mind" or "Inscription of the Perfect Mind." I chose to call this "Verses on the Perfect Mind."</p>
                                <p>
                                    The Hsin Hsin Ming has been much beloved by Zen practitioners for over a thousand years. It is still studied today in Western Zen circles. I find it is as relevant today as it was then.</p>
