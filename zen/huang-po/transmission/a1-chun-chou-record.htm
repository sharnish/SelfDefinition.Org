								1. The Master said to me: All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing but the One Mind, beside which nothing exists. This Mind, which is without beginning, is unborn <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-1"></a><sup><a href="#footnotes">[1]</a></sup> and indestructible. It is not green nor yellow, and has neither form nor appearance. It does not belong to the categories of things which exist or do not exist, nor can it be thought of in terms of new or old. It is neither long nor short, big nor small, for it transcends all limits, measures, names, traces and comparisons. It is that which you see before you &ndash; begin to reason about it and you at once fall into error. It is like the boundless void which cannot be fathomed or measured. The One Mind alone is the Buddha, and there is no distinction between the Buddha and sentient things, but that sentient beings are attached to forms and so seek externally for Buddhahood. By their very seeking they lose it, for that is using the Buddha to seek for the Buddha and using mind to grasp Mind. Even though they do their utmost for a full aeon, they will not be able to attain to it. They do not know that, if they put a stop to conceptual thought and forget their anxiety, the Buddha will appear before them, for this Mind is the Buddha and the Buddha is all living beings. It is not the less for being manifested in ordinary beings, nor is it greater for being manifested in the Buddhas.

								2. As to performing the six pāramitās <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-2"></a><sup><a href="#note-2">[2]</a></sup> and vast numbers of similar practices, or gaining merits as countless as the sands of the Ganges, since you are fundamentally complete in every respect, you should not try to supplement that perfection by such meaningless practices. When there is occasion for them, perform them; and, when the occasion is passed, remain quiescent. If you are not absolutely convinced that the Mind is the Buddha, and if you are attached to forms, practices and meritorious performances, your way of thinking is false and quite incompatible with the Way. The Mind is the Buddha, nor are there any other Buddhas or any other mind. It is bright and spotless as the void, having no form or appearance whatever. To make use of your minds to think conceptually is to leave the substance and attach yourselves to form. The Ever-Existent Buddha is not a Buddha of form or attachment. To practise the six pāramitās and a myriad similar practices with the intention of becoming a Buddha thereby is to advance by stages, but the Ever-Existent Buddha is not a Buddha of stages. Only awake to the One Mind, and there is nothing whatsoever to be attained. This is the REAL Buddha. The Buddha and all sentient beings are the One Mind and nothing else.

								3. Mind is like the void in which there is no confusion or evil, as when the sun wheels through it shining upon the four corners of the world. For, when the sun rises and illuminates the whole earth, the void gains not in brilliance; and, when the sun sets, the void does not darken. The phenomena of light and dark alternate with each other, but the nature of the void remains unchanged. So it is with the Mind of the Buddha and of sentient beings. If you look upon the Buddha as presenting a pure, bright or Enlightened appearance, or upon sentient beings as presenting a foul, dark or mortal-seeming appearance, these conceptions resulting from attachment to form will keep you from supreme knowledge, even after the passing of as many aeons as there are sands in the Ganges. There is only the One Mind and not a particle of anything else on which to lay hold, for this Mind is the Buddha. If you students of the Way do not awake to this Mind substance, you will overlay Mind with conceptual thought, you will seek the Buddha outside yourselves, and you will remain attached to forms, pious practices and so on, all of which are harmful and not at all the way to supreme knowledge.

								4. Making offerings to all the Buddhas of the universe is not equal to making offerings to one follower of the Way who has eliminated conceptual thought. Why? Because such a one forms no concepts whatever. The substance of the Absolute is inwardly like wood or stone, in that it is motionless, and outwardly like the void, in that it is without bounds or obstructions. It is neither subjective nor objective, has no specific location, is formless, and cannot vanish. Those who hasten towards it dare not enter, fearing to hurtle down through the void with nothing to cling to or to stay their fall. So they look to the brink and retreat. This refers to all those who seek such a goal through cognition. Thus, those who seek the goal through cognition are like the fur (many), while those who obtain intuitive knowledge of the Way are like the horns (few). <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-4"></a><sup><a href="#note-4">[4]</a></sup>

								5. Mañjuśrī represents fundamental law and Samanta&shy;bhadra, activity. By the former is meant the law of the real and unbounded void, and by the latter the inexhaustible activities beyond the sphere of form. Avalokite ś vara represents boundless compassion; Mahāsthāma, great wisdom, and Vimalakīrti, spotless name. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-5a"></a><sup><a href="#note-5a">[5a]</a></sup> Spotless refers to the real nature of things, while name means form; yet form is really one with real nature, hence the combined term &quot;spotless name&quot;. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-5b"></a><sup><a href="#note-5b">[5b]</a></sup> All the qualities typified by the great Bodhi-sattvas are inherent in men and are not to be separated from the One Mind. Awake to it, and it is there. You students of the Way who do not awake to this in your own minds, and who are attached to appearances or who seek for something objective outside your own minds, have all turned your backs on the Way. The sands of the Ganges! The Buddha said of these sands: &quot;If all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with Indra and all the gods walk across them, the sands do not rejoice; and, if oxen, sheep, reptiles and insects tread upon them, the sands are not angered. For jewels and perfumes they have no longing, and for the stinking filth of manure and urine they have no loathing.&quot;

								6. This Mind is no mind of conceptual thought and it is completely detached from form. So Buddhas and sentient beings do not differ at all. If you can only rid yourselves of conceptual thought, you will have accomplished everything. But if you students of the Way do not rid yourselves of conceptual thought in a flash, even though you strive for aeon after aeon, you will never accomplish it. Enmeshed in the meritorious practices of the Three Vehicles, you will be unable to attain Enlightenment. Nevertheless, the realization of the One Mind may come after a shorter or a longer period. There are those who, upon hearing this teaching, rid themselves of conceptual thought in a flash. There are others who do this after following through the Ten Beliefs, the Ten Stages, the Ten Activities and the Ten Bestowals of Merit. Yet others accomplish it after passing through the Ten Stages of a Bodhisattva&apos;s Progress. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-6a"></a><sup><a href="#note-6a">[6a]</a></sup> But whether they transcend conceptual thought by a longer or a shorter way, the result is a state of BEING: there is no pious practising and no action of realizing. That there is nothing which can be attained is not idle talk; it is the truth. Moreover, whether you accomplish your aim in a single flash of thought or after going through the Ten Stages of a Bodhisattva&apos;s Progress, the achievement will be the same; for this state of being admits of no degrees, so the latter method merely entails aeons of unnecessary suffering and toil. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-6b"></a><sup><a href="#note-6b">[6b]</a></sup>

								7. The building up of good and evil both involve attachment to form. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-7a"></a><sup><a href="#note-7a">[7a]</a></sup> Those who, being attached to form, do evil have to undergo various incarnations unnecessarily; while those who, being attached to form, do good, subject themselves to toil and privation equally to no purpose. In either case it is better to achieve sudden self-realization and to grasp the fundamental Dharma. This Dharma is Mind, beyond which there IS no Dharma; and this Mind is the Dharma, beyond which there IS no mind. Mind in itself is not mind, yet neither is it no-mind. To say that Mind is no-mind implies something existent. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-7b"></a><sup><a href="#note-7b">[7b]</a></sup> Let there be a silent understanding and no more. Away with all thinking and explaining. Then we may say that the Way of Words has been cut off and movements of the mind eliminated. This Mind is the pure Buddha-Source inherent in all men. All wriggling beings possessed of sentient life and all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are of this one substance and do not differ. Differences arise from wrong-thinking only and lead to the creation of all kinds of karma. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-7c"></a><sup><a href="#note-7c">[7c]</a></sup>

								8. Our original Buddha-Nature is, in highest truth, devoid of any atom of objectivity. It is void, omnipresent, silent, pure; it is glorious and mysterious peaceful joy &ndash; and that is all. Enter deeply into it by awaking to it yourself. That which is before you is it, in all its fullness, utterly complete. There is naught beside. Even if you go through all the stages of a Bodhisattva&apos;s progress towards Buddhahood, one by one; when at last, in a single flash, you attain to full realization, you will only be realizing the Buddha-Nature which has been with you all the time; and by all the foregoing stages you will have added to it nothing at all. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-8a"></a><sup><a href="#note-8a">[8a]</a></sup> You will come to look upon those aeons of work and achievement as no better than unreal actions performed in a dream. That is why the Tathāgata said: &quot;I truly attained nothing from complete, unexcelled Enlightenment. Had there been anything attained, Dīpamkara Buddha would not have made the prophecy concerning me.&quot; <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-8b"></a><sup><a href="#note-8b">[8b]</a></sup> He also said: &quot;This Dharma is absolutely without distinctions, neither high nor low, and its name is Bodhi.&quot; It is pure Mind, which is the source of everything and which, whether appearing as sentient beings or as Buddhas, as the rivers and mountains of the world which has form, as that which is formless, or as penetrating the whole universe, is absolutely without distinctions, there being no such entities as selfness and otherness.

								9. This pure Mind, the source of everything, shines forever and on all with the brilliance of its own perfection. But the people of the world do not awake to it, regarding only that which sees, hears, feels and knows as mind. Blinded by their own sight, hearing, feeling and knowing, they do not perceive the spiritual brilliance of the source-substance. If they would only eliminate all conceptual thought in a flash, that source-substance would manifest itself like the sun ascending through the void and illuminating the whole universe without hindrance or bounds. Therefore, if you students of the Way seek to progress through seeing, hearing, feeling and knowing, when you are deprived of your perceptions, your way to Mind will be cut off and you will find nowhere to enter. Only realize that, though real Mind is expressed in these perceptions, it neither forms part of them nor is separate from them. You should not start REASONING from these perceptions, nor allow them to give rise to conceptual thought; yet nor should you seek the One Mind apart from them or abandon them in your pursuit of the Dharma. Do not keep them nor abandon them nor dwell in them nor cleave to them. Above, below and around you, all is spontaneously existing, for there is nowhere which is outside the Buddha-Mind.

							<p>
								10. When the people of the world hear it said that the Buddhas transmit the Doctrine of the Mind, they suppose that there is something to be attained or realized apart from Mind, and thereupon they use Mind to seek the Dharma, not knowing that Mind and the object of their search are one. Mind cannot be used to seek something from Mind; for then, after the passing of millions of aeons, the day of success will still not have dawned. Such a method is not to be compared with suddenly eliminating conceptual thought, which is the fundamental Dharma. Suppose a warrior, forgetting that he was already wearing his pearl on his forehead, were to seek for it elsewhere, he could travel the whole world without finding it. But if someone who knew what was wrong were to point it out to him, the warrior would immediately realize that the pearl had been there all the time. So, if you students of the Way are mistaken about your own real Mind, not recognizing that it is the Buddha, you will consequently look for him elsewhere, indulging in various achievements and practices and expecting to attain realization by such graduated practices. But, even after aeons of diligent searching, you will not be able to attain to the Way. These methods cannot be compared to the sudden elimination of conceptual thought, in the certain knowledge that there is nothing at all which has absolute existence, nothing on which to lay hold, nothing on which to rely, nothing in which to abide, nothing subjective or objective.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is by preventing the rise of conceptual thought that you will realize Bodhi; and, when you do, you will just be realizing the Buddha who has always existed in your own Mind! Aeons of striving will prove to be so much wasted effort; just as, when the warrior found his pearl, he merely discovered what had been hanging on his forehead all the time; and just as his finding of it had nothing to do with his efforts to discover it elsewhere. Therefore the Buddha said: &quot;I truly attained nothing from complete, unexcelled Enlightenment.&quot; It was for fear that people would not believe this that he drew upon what is seen with the five sorts of vision and spoken with the five kinds of speech. So this quotation is by no means empty talk, but expresses the highest truth.

Students of the Way should be sure that the four elements composing the body do not constitute the &quot;self&quot;, that the &quot;self&quot; is not an entity; and that it can be deduced from this that the body is neither &quot;self&quot; nor entity. Moreover, the five aggregates composing the mind (in the common sense) do not constitute either a &quot;self&quot; or an entity; hence, it can be deduced that the (so-called individual) mind is neither &quot;self&quot; nor entity. The six sense organs (including the brain) which, together with their six types of perception and the six kinds of objects of perception, constitute the sensory world, must be understood in the same way. Those eighteen aspects of sense are separately and together void. There is only Mind-Source, limitless in extent and of absolute purity.

When the body composed of the four elements suffers the pangs of hunger and accordingly you provide it with food, but without greed, that is called wise eating. On the other hand, if you gluttonously delight in purity and flavour, you are permitting the distinctions which arise from wrong thinking. Merely seeking to gratify the organ of taste without realizing when you have taken enough is called sensual eating. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-12"></a><sup><a href="#note-12">[12]</a></sup>

Śrāvakas reach Enlightenment by hearing the Dharma, so they are called Śrāvakas. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-13a"></a><sup><a href="#note-13a">[13a]</a></sup> Śrāvakas do not comprehend their own mind, but allow concepts to arise from listening to the doctrine. Whether they hear of the existence of Bodhi and Nirvāna through supernormal powers or good fortune or preaching, they will attain to Buddhahood only after three aeons of infinitely long duration. All these belong to the way of the Śrāvakas, so they are called Śrāvaka-Buddhas. But to awaken suddenly to the fact that your own Mind is the Buddha, that there is nothing to be attained or a single action to be performed &ndash; this is the Supreme Way; this is really to be as a Buddha. It is only to be feared that you students of the Way, by the coming into existence of a single thought, may raise a barrier between yourselves and the Way. From thought-instant to thought-instant, no FORM; from thought-instant to thought-instant, no ACTIVITY &ndash; that is to be a Buddha! If you students of the Way wish to become Buddhas, you need study no doctrines whatever, but learn only how to avoid seeking for and attaching yourselves to anything. Where nothing is sought this implies Mind unborn; where no attachment exists, this implies Mind not destroyed; and that which is neither born nor destroyed is the Buddha. The eighty-four thousand methods for countering the eighty-four thousand forms of delusion are merely figures of speech for drawing people towards the Gate. In fact, none of them have real existence. Relinquishment of everything is the Dharma, and he who understands this is a Buddha, but the relinquishment of ALL delusions leaves no Dharma on which to lay hold. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-13b"></a><sup><a href="#note-13b">[13b]</a></sup>

								14. If you students of the Way desire knowledge of this great mystery, only avoid attachment to any single thing beyond Mind. To say that the real Dharmakāya of the Buddha <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-14a"></a><sup><a href="#note-14a">[14a]</a></sup> resembles the Void is another way of saying that the Dharmakāya is the Void and that the Void is the Dharmakāya. People often claim that the Dharmakāya is in the Void and that the Void contains the Dharmakāya, not realizing that they are one and the same. But if you define the Void as something existing, then it is not the Dharmakāya; and if you define the Dharmakāya as something existing, then it is not the Void. Only refrain from any objective conception of the Void; then it is the Dharmakāya: and, if only you refrain from any objective conception of the Dharmakāya, why, then it is the Void. These two do not differ from each other, nor is there any difference between sentient beings and Buddhas, or between saṁsāra and Nirvāna, or between delusion and Bodhi. When all such forms are abandoned, there is the Buddha. Ordinary people look to their surroundings, while followers of the Way look to Mind, but the true Dharma is to forget them both. The former is easy enough, the latter very difficult. Men are afraid to forget their minds, fearing to fall through the Void with nothing to stay their fall. They do not know that the Void is not really void, but the realm of the real Dharma. This spiritually enlightening nature is without beginning, as ancient as the Void, subject neither to birth nor to destruction, neither existing nor not existing, neither impure nor pure, neither clamorous nor silent, neither old nor young, occupying no space, having neither inside nor outside, size nor form, colour nor sound. It cannot be looked for or sought, comprehended by wisdom or knowledge, explained in words, contacted materially or reached by meritorious achievement. All the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, together with all wriggling things possessed of life, share in this great Nirvāņic nature. This nature is Mind; Mind is the Buddha, and the Buddha is the Dharma. Any thought apart from this truth is entirely a wrong thought. You cannot use Mind to seek Mind, the Buddha to seek the Buddha, or the Dharma to seek the Dharma. So you students of the Way should immediately refrain from conceptual thought. Let a tacit understanding be all! Any mental process must lead to error. There is just a transmission of Mind with Mind. This is the proper view to hold. Be careful not to look outwards to material surroundings. To mistake material surroundings for Mind is to mistake a thief for your son. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-14b"></a><sup><a href="#note-14b">[14b]</a></sup>

								15. It is only in contradistinction to greed, anger and ignorance that abstinence, calm and wisdom exist. Without illusion, how could there be Enlightenment? Therefore Bodhidharma said: &quot;The Buddha enunciated all Dharmas in order to eliminate every vestige of conceptual thinking. If I refrained entirely from conceptual thought, what would be the use of all the Dharmas?&quot; Attach yourselves to nothing beyond the pure Buddha-Nature which is the original source of all things. Suppose you were to adorn the Void with countless jewels, how could they remain in position? The Buddha-Nature is like the Void; though you were to adorn it with inestimable merit and wisdom, how could they remain there? <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-15a"></a><sup><a href="#note-15a">[15a]</a></sup> They would only serve to conceal its original Nature and to render it invisible.
							</p>
							<p>
								That which is called the Doctrine of Mental Origins (followed by certain other sects) postulates that all things are built up in Mind and that they manifest themselves upon contact with external environment, ceasing to be manifest when that environment is not present. But it is wrong to conceive of an environment separate from the pure, unvarying nature of all things. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-15b"></a><sup><a href="#note-15b">[15b]</a></sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								That which is called the Mirror of Concentration and Wisdom (another reference to non-Zen Mahāyāna doctrine) requires the use of sight, hearing, feeling and cognition, which lead to successive states of calm and agitation. But these involve conceptions based on environmental objects; they are temporary expedients appertaining to one of the lower categories of &quot;roots of goodness&quot;. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-15c"></a><sup><a href="#note-15c">[15c]</a></sup> And this category of &quot;roots of goodness&quot; merely enables people to understand what is said to them. If you wish to experience Enlightenment yourselves, you must not indulge in such conceptions. They are all environmental Dharmas concerning things which are and things which are not, based on existence and non-existence. If only you will avoid concepts of existence and non-existence in regard to absolutely everything, you will then perceive THE DHARMA.

								16. On the first day of the ninth moon, the Master said to me: From the time when the Great Master Bodhidharma arrived in China, he spoke only of the One Mind and transmitted only the one Dharma. He used the Buddha to transmit the Buddha, never speaking of any other Buddha. He used the Dharma to transmit the Dharma, never speaking of any other Dharma. That Dharma was the wordless Dharma, and that Buddha was the intangible Buddha, since they were in fact that Pure Mind which is the source of all things. This is the only truth; all else is false. Prajñā is wisdom; wisdom is the formless original Mind-Source. Ordinary people do not seek the Way, but merely indulge their six senses which lead them back into the six realms of existence. A student of the Way, by allowing himself a single saṁsāric thought, falls among devils. If he permits himself a single thought leading to differential perception, he falls into heresy. To hold that there is something born and to try to eliminate it, that is to fall among the Śrāvakas. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-16a"></a><sup><a href="#note-16a">[16a]</a></sup> To hold that things are not born but capable of destruction is to fall among the Pratyekas. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-16b"></a><sup><a href="#note-16b">[16b]</a></sup> Nothing is born, nothing is destroyed. Away with your dualism, your likes and dislikes. Every single thing is just the One Mind. When you have perceived this, you will have mounted the Chariot of the Buddhas.

								17. Ordinary people all indulge in conceptual thought based on environmental phenomena, hence they feel desire and hatred. To eliminate environmental phenomena, just put an end to your conceptual thinking. When this ceases, environmental phenomena are void; and when these are void, thought ceases. But if you try to eliminate environment without first putting a stop to conceptual thought, you will not succeed, but merely increase its power to disturb you. Thus all things are naught but Mind &ndash; intangible Mind; so what can you hope to attain? Those who are students of Prajna <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-17a"></a><sup><a href="#note-17a">[17a]</a></sup> hold that there is nothing tangible whatever, so they cease thinking of the Three Vehicles. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-17b"></a><sup><a href="#note-17b">[17b]</a></sup> There is only the one reality, neither to be realized nor attained. To say &quot;I am able to realize something&quot; or &quot;I am able to attain something&quot; is to place yourself among the arrogant. The men who flapped their garments and left the meeting as mentioned in the Lotus Sūtra were just such people. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-17c"></a><sup><a href="#note-17c">[17c]</a></sup> Therefore the Buddha said: &quot;I truly obtained nothing from Enlightenment.&quot; There is just a mysterious tacit understanding and no more.

									<a class="endnote" id="note-1"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-1">[1]</a> Unborn, not in the sense of eternity, for this allows contrast with its opposite; but unborn in the sense that it belongs to no categories admitting of alteration or antithesis.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-2"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-2">[2]</a> Charity, morality, patience under affliction, zealous application, right control of mind and the application of the highest wisdom.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-4"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-4">[4]</a> Compare this with Professor Suzuki&apos;s: &quot;That which is known as mind in discursive reasoning is no-mind, though without this Mind cannot be reached.&quot;
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-5a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-5a">[5a]</a> This abstract notion of the Bodhisattvas, regarded by some sects as individual spiritual entities, is shared by some Buddhists outside the Zen Sect.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-5b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-5b">[5b]</a> Zen teaches that, though the phenomenal world based on sensory experience has only relative existence, it is wrong to regard it as something separate from the One Mind. It is the One Mind wrongly apprehended. As the Hridaya Sūtra says: &quot;Form is not different from void, void from form; form is void and void is form.&quot;
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-6a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-6a">[6a]</a> These various categories of ten are all part of the doctrine as taught by certain other sects. Huang Po wishes to make it clear that, though these may be useful in preparing the ground, the mind must in any case take a sudden leap, and that having passed through these stages in nowise constitutes partial Enlightenment.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-6b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-6b">[6b]</a> Merit, however excellent in itself, has nothing to do with Enlightenment.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-7a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-7a">[7a]</a> According to Zen, virtuous actions should be performed by adepts, but not with a view to accumulating merit and not as a means to Enlightenment. The doer should remain perfectly unattached to the actions and to their results.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-7b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-7b">[7b]</a> In other words, Mind is an arbitary term for something that cannot properly be expressed in words.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-7c"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-7c">[7c]</a> Karma, even good karma, leads to rebirth and prolongs the wanderings of the supposedly individual entity; for when good karma has worked itself out in consequent enjoyment, the &quot;individual&quot; is as far from understanding the One Mind as ever.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-8a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-8a">[8a]</a> Enlightenment must come in a flash, whether you have passed through the preliminary stages or not, so the latter can well be dispensed with, except that, for reasons unconnected with Enlightenment, Zen requires of adepts an attitude of kindness and helpfulness towards all living creatures.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-8b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-8b">[8b]</a> This quotation refers to the Diamond Sūtra, as do many of the others either directly or indirectly. Dīpamkara Buddha, during a former life of Gautama Buddha, prophesied that he would one day attain to Buddhahood. Huang Po means that the prophecy would not have been made if Dīpamkara Buddha had supposed that Gautama Buddha&apos;s Enlightenment would lead to the actual attainment of something he had not already been from the very first; for then Enlightenment would not have led to Buddhahood, which implies a voidness of all distinctions such as attainer, attained, non-attainer and non-attained.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-12"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-12">[12]</a> This is a simple example of the wrong use of the six senses. Of course we must use them for dealing with the world as it affects our daily lives, but our employment of them should be limited to what is strictly necessary for our wellbeing.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-13a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-13a">[13a]</a> Huang Po sometimes stretches this term to apply to Hīnayānists in general. The literal meaning of its Chinese equivalent is &quot;those who hear&quot; and Huang Po implies that Hīnayānists pay too much attention to the literal meaning of the Scriptures, instead of seeking intuitive knowledge through eliminating conceptual thought. Those able to apply the latter method have no need of scriptures.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-13b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-13b">[13b]</a> Buddhists of most sects are taught to relinquish sensual attachments and to cling singlemindedly to the Dharma. Huang Po goes further in showing that any form of attachment, even attachment to the Dharma, leads us away from the truth.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-14a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-14a">[14a]</a> The highest of the three Bodies, synonymous with the Absolute.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-14b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-14b">[14b]</a> There is a story of a man who mistook a thief for his long-lost son and, giving him a warm welcome, enabled the latter to sneak away with most of his possessions. Those who place reliance on material things are in danger of losing that most valuable of all possessions &ndash; the key to the riddle of life which unlocks Nirvāna&apos;s gate.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-15a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-15a">[15a]</a> Other Buddhist sects attach great importance to the acquisition of merit and wisdom, but this implies a dualistic conception of reality which Zen considers an insuperable obstacle to realization of the One Mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-15b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-15b">[15b]</a> This constitutes a warning against another type of dualism.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-15c"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-15c">[15c]</a> Roots of goodness are believed by some Mahāyānaists to be &quot;Enlightenment-potentials&quot; of varying degrees of strength with which individuals are reborn in accordance with the varying merits gained in former lives.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-16a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-16a">[16a]</a> Huang Po, according to his usual custom, is using the word Śrāvaka to mean Hīnayānist. Hīnayānists are dualists in that they seek to overcome their saṁsāric life in order to enter Nirvāna; while Zen perceives that saṁsāra is no other than Nirvāna.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-16b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-16b">[16b]</a> Huang Po customarily uses or misuses this word to mean the Mādhyamikists or followers of the Middle Vehicle.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-17a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-17a">[17a]</a> Here used to mean Wisdom in the sense of Zen.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-17b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-17b">[17b]</a> I.e. the Three Great Schools teaching gradual Enlightenment.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-17c"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-17c">[17c]</a> These people THOUGHT they had understood and were smugly self-satisfied.
