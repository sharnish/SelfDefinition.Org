								18. If an ordinary man, when he is about to die, could only see the five elements of consciousness as void; the four physical elements as not constituting an &quot;I&quot;; the real Mind as formless and neither coming nor going; his nature as something neither commencing at his birth nor perishing at his death, but as whole and motionless in its very depths; his Mind and environmental objects as one &ndash; if he could really accomplish this, he would receive Enlightenment in a flash. He would no longer be entangled by the Triple World; he would be a World-Transcendor. He would be without even the faintest tendency towards rebirth. If he should behold the glorious sight of all the Buddhas coming to welcome him, surrounded by every kind of gorgeous manifestation, he would feel no desire to approach them. If he should behold all sorts of horrific forms surrounding him, he would experience no terror. He would just be himself, oblivious of conceptual thought and one with the Absolute. He would have attained the state of unconditioned being. This, then, is the fundamental principle. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-18"></a><sup><a href="#footnotes">[18]</a></sup>

On the eighth day of the tenth moon, the Master said to me: That which is called the City of Illusion contains the Two Vehicles, the Ten Stages of a Bodhisattva&apos;s Progress, and the two forms of Full Enlightenment. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-19a"></a><sup><a href="#note-19a">[19a]</a></sup> All of them are powerful teachings for arousing people&apos;s interest, but they still belong to the City of Illusion. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-19b"></a><sup><a href="#note-19b">[19b]</a></sup> That which is called the Place of Precious Things is the real Mind, the original Buddha-Essence, the treasure of our own real Nature. These jewels cannot be measured or accumulated. Yet since there are neither Buddha nor sentient beings, neither subject nor object, where can there be a City of Precious Things? If you ask, &quot;Well, so much for the City of Illusion, but where is the Place of Precious Things?&quot;, it is a place to which no directions can be given. For, if it could be pointed out, it would be a place existing in space; hence, it could not be the real Place of Precious Things. All we can say is that it is close by. It cannot be exactly described, but when you have a tacit understanding of its substance, it is there.

								20. Icchantikas are those with beliefs which are incomplete. All beings within the six realms of existence, including those who follow Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna, if they do not believe in their potential Buddhahood, are accordingly called Icchantikas with cut-off roots of goodness. Bodhisattvas <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-20a"></a><sup><a href="#note-20a">[20a]</a></sup> who believe deeply in the Buddha-Dharma, without accepting the division into Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna, but who do not realize the one Nature of Buddhas and sentient beings, are accordingly called Icchantikas with roots of goodness. Those who are Enlightened largely through hearing the spoken doctrine are termed Śrāvaka (hearers). Those Enlightened through perception of the law of karma are called Pratyeka-Buddhas. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-20b"></a><sup><a href="#note-20b">[20b]</a></sup> Those who become Buddhas, but not from Enlightenment occurring in their own minds, are called Hearer-Buddhas. Most students of the Way are Enlightened through the Dharma which is taught in words and not through the Dharma of Mind. Even after successive aeons of effort, they will not become attuned to the original Buddha-Essence. For those who are not Enlightened from within their own Mind, but from hearing the Dharma which is taught in words, make light of Mind and attach importance to doctrine, so they advance only step by step, neglecting their original Mind. Thus, if only you have a tacit understanding of Mind, you will not need to search for any Dharma, for then Mind is the Dharma. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-20c"></a><sup><a href="#note-20c">[20c]</a></sup>

								21. People are often hindered by environmental phenomena from perceiving Mind, and by individual events from perceiving underlying principles; so they often try to escape from environmental phenomena in order to still their minds, or to obscure events in order to retain their grasp of principles. They do not realize that this is merely to obscure phenomena with Mind, events with principles. Just let your minds become void and environmental phenomena will void themselves; let principles cease to stir and events will cease stirring of themselves. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-21a"></a><sup><a href="#note-21a">[21a]</a></sup> Do not employ Mind in this perverted way.

								Many people are afraid to empty their minds lest they may plunge into the Void. They do not know that their own Mind is the void. The ignorant eschew phenomena but not thought; the wise eschew thought but not phenomena. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-21b"></a><sup><a href="#note-21b">[21b]</a></sup>

								22. The Bodhisattva&apos;s mind is like the void, for he relinquishes everything and does not even desire to accumulate merits. There are three kinds of relinquishment. When everything inside and outside, bodily and mental, has been relinquished; when, as in the Void, no attachments are left; when all action is dictated purely by place and circumstance; when subjectivity and objectivity are forgotten &ndash; that is the highest form of relinquishment. When, on the one hand, the Way is followed by the performance of virtuous acts; while, on the other, relinquishment of merit takes place and no hope of reward is entertained &ndash; that is the medium form of relinquishment. When all sorts of virtuous actions are performed in the hope of reward by those who, nevertheless, know of the Void by hearing the Dharma and who are therefore unattached &ndash; that is the lowest form of relinquishment. The first is like a blazing torch held to the front which makes it impossible to mistake the path; the second is like a blazing torch held to one side, so that it is sometimes light and sometimes dark; the third is like a blazing torch held behind, so that pitfalls in front are not seen. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-22"></a><sup><a href="#note-22">[22]</a></sup>

								23. Thus, the mind of the Bodhisattva is like the Void and everything is relinquished by it. When thoughts of the past cannot be taken hold of, that is relinquishment of the past. When thoughts of the present cannot be taken hold of, that is relinquishment of the present. When thoughts of the future cannot be taken hold of, that is relinquishment of the future. This is called utter relinquishment of Triple Time. Since the Tathāgata entrusted Kāsyapa with the Dharma until now, Mind has been transmitted with Mind, and these Minds have been identical. A transmission of Void cannot be made through words. A transmission in concrete terms cannot be the Dharma. Thus Mind is transmitted with Mind and these Minds do not differ. Transmitting and receiving transmission are both a most difficult kind of mysterious understanding, so that few indeed have been able to receive it. In fact, however, Mind is not Mind and transmission is not really transmission. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-23"></a><sup><a href="#note-23">[23]</a></sup>

								24. A Buddha has three bodies. By the Dharmakāya is meant the Dharma of the omnipresent voidness of the real self-existent Nature of everything. By the Sambhogakāya is meant the Dharma of the underlying universal purity of things. By the Nirmānakāya is meant the Dharmas of the six practices leading to Nirvāna and all other such devices. The Dharma of the Dharmakāya cannot be sought through speech or hearing or the written word. There is nothing which can be said or made evident. There is just the omnipresent voidness of the real self-existent Nature of everything, and no more. Therefore, saying that there is no Dharma to be explained in words is called preaching the Dharma. The Sambhogakāya and the Nirmānakāya both respond with appearances suited to particular circumstances. Spoken Dharmas which respond to events through the senses and in all sorts of guises are none of them the real Dharma. So it is said that the Sambhogakāya or the Nirmanakāya is not a real Buddha or preacher of the Dharma. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-24"></a><sup><a href="#note-24">[24]</a></sup>

								25. The term unity refers to a homogeneous spiritual brilliance which separates into six harmoniously blended &quot;elements&quot;. The homogeneous spiritual brilliance is the One Mind, while the six harmoniously blended &quot;elements&quot; are the six sense organs. These six sense organs become severally united with objects that defile them &ndash; the eyes with form, the ear with sound, the nose with smell, the tongue with taste, the body with touch, and the thinking mind with entities. Between these organs and their objects arise the six sensory perceptions, making eighteen sense-realms in all. If you understand that these eighteen realms have no objective existence, you will bind the six harmoniously blended &quot;elements&quot; into a single spiritual brilliance &ndash; a single spiritual brilliance which is the One Mind. All students of the Way know this, but cannot avoid forming concepts of &quot;a single spiritual brilliance&quot; and &quot;the six harmoniously blended elements&quot;. Accordingly they are chained to entities and fail to achieve a tacit understanding of original Mind. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-25"></a><sup><a href="#note-25">[25]</a></sup>

But people would not have believed him and, by scoffing at him, would have become immersed in the sea of sorrow (samsara). On the other hand, if he had said nothing at all, that would have been selfishness, and he would not have been able to diffuse knowledge of the mysterious Way for the benefit of sentient beings. So he adopted the expedient of preaching that there are Three Vehicles. As, however, these Vehicles are relatively greater and lesser, unavoidably there are shallow teachings and profound teachings &ndash; none of them being the original Dharma. So it is said that there is only a One-Vehicle Way; if there were more, they could not be real. Besides there is absolutely no way of describing the Dharma of the One Mind. Therefore the Tathāgata called Kānyapa to come and sit with him on the Seat of Proclaiming the Law, separately entrusting to him the Wordless Dharma of the One Mind. This branchless Dharma was to be separately practised; and those who should be tacitly Enlightened would arrive at the state of Buddhahood. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-26"></a><sup><a href="#note-26">[26]</a></sup>

								29. Regarding this Zen Doctrine of ours, since it was first transmitted, it has never taught that men should seek for learning or form concepts. &quot;Studying the Way&quot; is just a figure of speech. It is a method of arousing people&apos;s interest in the early stages of their development. In fact, the Way is not something which can be studied. Study leads to the retention of concepts and so the Way is entirely misunderstood, Moreover. the Way is not something specially existing; it is called the Mahāyāna Mind &ndash; Mind which is not to be found inside, outside or in the middle. Truly it is not located anywhere. The first step is to refrain from knowledge-based concepts. This implies that if you were to follow the empirical method to the utmost limit, on reaching that limit you would still be unable to locate Mind. The way is spiritual Truth and was originally without name or title. It was only because people ignorantly sought for it empirically that the Buddhas appeared and taught them to eradicate this method of approach. Fearing that nobody would understand, they selected the name &quot;Way&quot;. You must not allow this name to lead you into forming a mental concept of a road. So it is said &quot;When the fish is caught we pay no more attention to the trap.&quot; When body and mind achieve spontaneity, the Way is reached and Mind is understood. A śramana <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-29a"></a><sup><a href="#note-29a">[29a]</a></sup> is so called because he has penetrated to the original source of all things. The fruit of attaining the Śramana stage is gained by putting an end to all anxiety; it does not come from book-learning. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-29b"></a><sup><a href="#note-29b">[29b]</a></sup>

								30. If you now set about using your minds to seek Mind, listening to the teaching of others, and hoping to reach the goal through mere learning, when will you ever succeed? Some of the ancients had sharp minds; they no sooner heard the Doctrine proclaimed than they hastened to discard all learning. So they were called &quot;Sages who, abandoning learning, have come to rest in spontaneity&quot;. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-30a"></a><sup><a href="#note-30a">[30a]</a></sup> In these days people only seek to stuff themselves with knowledge and deductions, seeking everywhere for book-knowledge and calling this &quot;Dharma-practice&quot;. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-30b"></a><sup><a href="#note-30b">[30b]</a></sup> They do not know that so much knowledge and deduction have just the contrary effect of piling up obstacles. Merely acquiring a lot of knowledge makes you like a child who gives himself indigestion by gobbling too much curds. Those who study the Way according to the Three Vehicles are all like this. All you can call them is people who suffer from indigestion. When so-called knowledge and deductions are not digested, they become poisons, for they belong only to the plane of samsāra. In the Absolute, there is nothing at all of this kind. So it is said: &quot;In the armoury of my sovereign, there is no Sword of Thusness&quot;. All the concepts you have formed in the past must be discarded and replaced by void. Where dualism ceases, there is the Void of the Womb of Tathāgatas. The term &quot;Womb of Tathāgatas&quot; implies that not the smallest hairsbreadth of anything can exist there. That is why the Dharma Rāja (the Buddha), who broke down the notion of objective existence, manifested himself in this world, and that is why he said: &quot;When I was with Dīpamkara Buddha there was not a particle of anything for me to attain.&quot; This saying is intended just to void your sense-based knowledge and deductions. Only he who restrains every vestige of empiricism and ceases to rely upon anything can become a perfectly tranquil man. The canonical teachings of the Three Vehicles are just remedies for temporary needs. They were taught to meet such needs and so are of temporary value and differ one from another. If only this could be understood, there would be no more doubts about it. Above all it is essential not to select some particular teaching suited to a certain occasion, and, being impressed by its forming part of the written canon, regard it as an immutable concept. Why so? Because in truth there is no unalterable Dharma which the Tathāgata could have preached. People of our sect would never argue that there could be such a thing. We just know how to put all mental activity to rest and thus achieve tranquillity. We certainly do not begin by thinking things out and end up in perplexity.

								31. Q: From all you have just said, Mind is the Buddha; but it is not clear as to what sort of mind is meant by this &quot;Mind which is the Buddha&quot;.
							</p>
							<p>
								A: How many minds have you got?
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: But is the Buddha the ordinary mind or the Enlightened mind?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: Where on earth do you keep your &quot;ordinary mind&quot; and your &quot;Enlightened mind&quot;?
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: In the teaching of the Three Vehicles it is stated that there are both. Why does Your Reverence deny it?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: In the teaching of the Three Vehicles it is clearly explained that the ordinary and Enlightened minds are illusions. You don&apos;t understand. All this clinging to the idea of things existing is to mistake vacuity for the truth. How can such conceptions not be illusory? Being illusory, they hide Mind from you. If you would only rid yourselves of the concepts of ordinary and Enlightened, you would find that there is no other Buddha than the Buddha in your own Mind. When Bodhidharma came from the West, he just pointed out that the substance of which all men are composed is the Buddha. You people go on misunderstanding; you hold to concepts such as &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;Enlightened&quot;, directing your thoughts outwards where they gallop about like horses! All this amounts to beclouding your own minds! So I tell you Mind is the Buddha. As soon as thought or sensation arises, you fall into dualism. Beginningless time and the present moment are the same. There is no this and no that. To understand this truth is called compete and unexcelled Enlightenment.
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: Upon what Doctrine (Dharma-principles) does Your Reverence base these words?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: Why seek a doctrine? As soon as you have a doctrine, you fall into dualistic thought.
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: Just now you said that the beginningless past and the present are the same. What do you mean by that?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: It is just because of your SEEKING that you make a difference between them. If you were to stop seeking, how could there be any difference between them?
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: If they are not different, why did you employ separate terms for them?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: If you hadn&apos;t mentioned ordinary and Enlightened, who would have bothered to say such things? Just as those categories have no real existence, so Mind is not really &quot;mind&quot;. And, as both Mind and those categories are really illusions, wherever can you hope to find anything?

							<p class="question">
								32. Q: Illusion can hide from us our own mind, but up to now you have not taught us how to get rid of illusion.
							</p>
							<p>
								A: The arising and the elimination of illusion are both illusory. Illusion is not something rooted in Reality; it exists because of your dualistic thinking. If you will only cease to indulge in opposed concepts such as &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;Enlightened&quot;, illusion will cease of itself. And then if you still want to destroy it wherever it may be, you will find that there is not a hairsbreadth left of anything on which to lay hold. This is the meaning of: &quot;I will let go with both hands, for then I shall certainly discover the Buddha in my Mind.&quot;
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: If there is nothing on which to lay hold, how is the Dharma to be transmitted?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: It is a transmission of Mind with Mind.
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: If Mind is used for transmission, why do you say that Mind too does not exist?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: Obtaining no Dharma whatever is called Mind transmission. The understanding of this Mind implies no Mind and no Dharma.
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: If there is no Mind and no Dharma, what is meant by transmission?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: You hear people speak of Mind transmission and then you talk of something to be received. So Bodhidharma said:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="tight">
								<p>
									The nature of the Mind when understood,
								</p>
								<p>
									No human speech can compass or disclose.
								</p>
								<p>
									Enlightenment is naught to be attained,
								</p>
								<p>
									And he that gains it does not say he knows.
								</p>

							<p class="question">
								33. Q: Surely the void stretching out in front of our eyes is objective. Then aren&apos;t you pointing to something objective and seeing Mind in it?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: What sort of mind could I tell you to see in an objective environment? Even if you could see it, it would only be Mind reflected in an objective sphere. You would be like a man looking at his face in a mirror; though you could distinguish your features in it clearly, you would still be looking at a mere reflection. What bearing has this on the affair that brought you to me?
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: If we do not see by means of reflections, when shall we see at all?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: So long as you are concerned with &quot;by means of&quot;, you will always be depending on something false. When will you ever succeed in understanding? Instead of observing those who tell you to open wide both your hands like one who has nothing to lose, you waste your strength bragging about all sorts of things.
							</p>
							<p class="question">
								Q: To those who understand, even reflections are nothing?
							</p>
							<p>
								A: If solid things do not exist, how much the less can we make use of reflections. Don&apos;t go about babbling like a dreamer with his eyes open (like a sleepwalker).
							</p>
							<p>
								Stepping into the public hall, His Reverence said: Having many sorts of knowledge cannot compare with giving up SEEKING for anything, which is the best of all things. Mind is not of several kinds and there is no Doctrine which can be put into words. As there is no more to be said, the assembly is dismissed!

							</p>
							<p>
								A: What would you do with such a parasitical plant as that? Reality is perfect purity; why base a discussion on false terms? To be absolutely without concepts is called the Wisdom of Dispassion. Every day, whether walking, standing, sitting or lying down, and in all your speech, remain detached from everything within the sphere of phenomena. Whether you speak or merely blink an eye, let it be done with complete dispassion. Now we are getting towards the end of the third period of five hundred years since the time of the Buddha, and most students of Zen cling to all sorts of sounds and forms. Why do they not copy me by letting each thought go as though it were nothing, or as though it were a piece of rotten wood, a stone, or the cold ashes of a dead fire? Or else, by just making whatever slight response is suited to each occasion? If you do not act thus, when you reach the end of your days here, you will be tortured by Yama. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-34b"></a><sup><a href="#note-34b">[34b]</a></sup> You must get away from the doctrines of existence and non-existence, for Mind is like the sun, forever in the void, shining spontaneously, shining without intending to shine. This is not something which you can accomplish without effort, but when you reach the point of clinging to nothing whatever, you will be acting as the Buddhas act. This will indeed be acting in accordance with the saying: &quot;Develop a mind which rests on no thing whatever.&quot; <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-34c"></a><sup><a href="#note-34c">[34c]</a></sup> For this is your pure Dharmakāya, which is called supreme perfect Enlightenment. If you cannot understand this, though you gain profound knowledge from your studies, though you make the most painful efforts and practise the most stringent austerities, you will still fail to know your own mind. All your effort will have been misdirected and you will certainly join the family of Māra. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-34d"></a><sup><a href="#note-34d">[34d]</a></sup> What advantage can you gain from this sort of practice? As Chih Kung <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-34e"></a><sup><a href="#note-34e">[34e]</a></sup> once said: &quot;The Buddha is really the creation of your own Mind. How, then, can he be sought through scriptures?&quot; Though you study how to attain the Three Grades of Bodhisattvahood, the Four Grades of Sainthood, and the Ten Stages of a Bodhisattva&apos;s Progress to Enlightenment until your mind is full of them, you will merely be balancing yourself between &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;Enlightened&quot;. Not to see that all METHODS of following the Way are ephemeral is samsāric Dharma.
							</p>
							<blockquote class="tight">

								<p>
									Its strength once spent, the arrow falls to earth.

								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								It is because you are not that sort of man that you insist on a thorough study of the methods established by people of old for gaining knowledge on the conceptual level. Chih Kung also said: &quot;If you do not meet a transcendental teacher, you will have swallowed the Mahāyāna medicine in vain!&quot;

								35. If you would spend all your time &ndash; walking, standing, sitting or lying down &ndash; learning to halt the concept-forming activities of your own mind, you could be sure of ultimately attaining the goal. Since your strength is insufficient, you might not be able to transcend samsāra by a single leap; but, after five or ten years, you would surely have made a good beginning and be able to make further progress spontaneously. It is because you are not that sort of man that you feel obliged to employ your mind &quot;studying Dhyāna&quot; and &quot;studying the Way&quot;. What has all that got to do with Buddhism? So it is said that all the Tathāgata taught was just to convert people; it was like pretending yellow leaves are real gold just to stop the flow of a child&apos;s tears; it must by no means be regarded as though it were ultimate truth. If you take it for truth, you are no member of our sect; and what bearing can it have on your original substance? So the Sūtra says: &quot;What is called supreme perfect wisdom implies that there is really nothing whatever to be attained.&quot; If you are also able to understand this, you will realize that the Way of the Buddhas and the Way of devils are equally wide of the mark. The original pure, glistening universe is neither square nor round, big nor small; it is without any such distinctions as long and short, it is beyond attachment and activity, ignorance and Enlightenment. You must see clearly that there is really nothing at all &ndash; no humans and no Buddhas. The great chiliocosms, numberless as grains of sand, are mere bubbles. All wisdom and all holiness are but streaks of lightning. None of them have the reality of Mind. The Dharmakāya, from ancient times until today, together with the Buddhas and Patriarchs, is One. How can it lack a single hair of anything? Even if you understand this, you must make the most strenuous efforts. Throughout this life, you can never be certain of living long enough to take another breath. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-35"></a><sup><a href="#note-35">[35]</a></sup>

								36. Q: The Sixth Patriarch <span class="note">[Hui Neng]</span> was illiterate. How is it that he was handed the robe which elevated him to that office? Elder Shên Hsiu (a rival candidate) occupied a position above five hundred others and, as a teaching monk, he was able to expound thirty-two volumes of Sūtras. Why did he not receive the robe?</p>
							<p>
								A: Because he still indulged in conceptual thought &ndash; in a dharma of activity. To him &quot;as you practise, so shall you attain&quot; was a reality. So the Fifth Patriarch made the transmission to Hui Nêng (Wei Lang). At that very moment, the latter attained a tacit understanding and received in silence the profoundest thought of the Tathāgata. That is why the Dharma was transmitted to him. You do not see that THE FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINE OF THE DHARMA IS THAT THERE ARE NO DHARMAS, YET THAT THIS DOCTRINE OF NO-DHARMA IS IN ITSELF A DHARMA; AND NOW THAT THE NO-DHARMA DOCTRINE HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED, HOW CAN THE DOCTRINE OF THE DHARMA BE A DHARMA? <a class="return-anchor" id="return-note-36"></a><sup><a href="#note-36">[36]</a></sup> Whoever understands the meaning of this deserves to be called a monk, one skilled at &quot;Dharma-practice&quot;. If you do not believe this, you must explain the following story. &quot;The Elder Wei Ming climbed to the summit of the Ta Yü Mountain to visit the Sixth Patriarch. The latter asked him why he had come. Was it for the robe or for the Dharma? The Elder Wei Ming answered that he had not come for the robe, but only for the Dharma; whereupon the Sixth Patriarch said: &quot;Perhaps you will concentrate your thoughts for a moment and avoid thinking in terms of good and evil.&quot; Ming did as he was told, and the Sixth Patriarch continued: &quot;While you are not thinking of good and not thinking of evil, just at this very moment, return to what you were before your father and mother were born.&quot; Even as the words were spoken, Ming arrived at a sudden tacit understanding. Accordingly he bowed to the ground and said: &quot;I am like a man drinking water who knows in himself how cool it is. I have lived with the Fifth Patriarch and his disciples for thirty years, but it is only today that I am able to banish the mistakes in my former way of thinking.&quot; The Sixth Patriarch replied: &quot;Just so. Now at last you understand why, when the First Patriarch arrived from India, he just pointed directly at men&apos;s Minds, by which they could perceive their real Nature and become Buddhas, and why he never spoke of anything besides.&quot; &quot; Have we not seen how, when Ānanda asked K ās yapa what the World Honoured had transmitted to him in addition to the golden robe, the latter exclaimed, &quot;Ānanda!&quot; and, upon Ānanda&apos;s respectfully answering &quot;Yes?&quot;, continued: &quot;Throw down the flagpole at the monastery gate.&quot; Such was the sign which the First (Indian) Patriarch gave him. For thirty years the wise Ānanda ministered to the Buddha&apos;s personal needs; but, because he was too fond of acquiring knowledge, the Buddha admonished him, saying: &quot;If you pursue knowledge for a thousand days, that will avail you less than one day&apos;s proper study of the Way. If you do not study it, you will be unable to digest even a single drop of water!&quot;

								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-18"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-18">[18]</a> This paragraph is, perhaps, one of the finest expositions of Zen teaching, for it encompasses in a few words almost the entire scope of that vast and penetrating wisdom.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-19a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-19a">[19a]</a> Including the form which leads to the awakening of others.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-19b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-19b">[19b]</a> The City of Illusion is a term taken from the Lotus Sūtra and here implies temporary or incomplete Nirvāna. From the point of view of Zen, all the teachings of the many sects based on a belief in gradual Enlightenment are likely to lead their followers to the City of Illusion, because all of them apparently subscribe to some form or other of dualism.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-20a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-20a">[20a]</a> Here meaning Buddhists.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-20b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-20b">[20b]</a> Commonly meaning those Buddhas who do not interest themselves in the Enlightenment of others.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-20c"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-20c">[20c]</a> Most of this paragraph is intended to make it clear that, though Buddhism of the gradual school does produce results, they take long to attain and are at least incomplete compared with results obtained through Zen.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-21a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-21a">[21a]</a> To FORCE the mind to blot out phenomena shows ignorance of the identity of the one with the other.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-21b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-21b">[21b]</a> This profound teaching is aimed partly at those Buddhists who practise a form of meditation which aims at temporarily blotting out the material world.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-22"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-22">[22]</a> These three types of relinquishment probably refer obliquely to Zen, Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna respectively.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-23"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-23">[23]</a> This is a reminder that all terms used in Zen are mere makeshifts.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-24"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-24">[24]</a> As usual, Huang Po is using familiar Sanskrit terms in a way peculiar to himself. Usually, the Dharmakāya means the highest aspect of a Buddha, i.e. as one with the Absolute; the Sambhogakāya is the glorified Body of a Buddha in his supramundane existence; and the Nirmāņakāya may be any of the various transformations in which a Buddha appears in the world. In Zen, the first is absolute truth in unimaginable and perfect form, the second is the highest concept of absolute truth of which unenlightened human beings are capable &ndash; an underlying purity and unity; the third represents the various methods by which we hope to obtain perception of absolute truth.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-25"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-25">[25]</a> This points to those people who are capable of understanding the doctrine intelligently but who have not yet entirely succeeded in throwing off the burden of concepts.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-26"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-26">[26]</a> This passage demonstrates that Huang Po himself accepted the traditional origin of the Zen Sect; but, as I have pointed out in the introduction, the truth of this tradition does not affect the validity of the teaching one way or the other, since Huang Po is surely speaking from a direct experience of the One Mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-27"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-27">[27]</a> Huang Po is obviously trying to help his questioner break away from the habit of thinking in terms of concepts and logical categories. To do this, he is obliged to make his questioner seem wrong, whatever he asks. We are reminded of the Buddha who, when questioned about such things as existence and non-existence, would reply: &quot;Not this, not this.&quot;
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-28"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-28">[28]</a> Such people mistake motions taking place within their minds for external independently moving objects.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-29a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-29a">[29a]</a> Commonly, the word for &quot;monk&quot;.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-29b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-29b">[29b]</a> This passage has a strong Taoist flavour. The quotation is from Chuang Tzû, and the word Tao (Way) is used throughout. Zen and Taoism have so much in common that some have been led to believe that the former is a sort of Taoism in Buddhist disguise; but, as both sects employ much the same theory and practice, it may be that the similarity is because the teachers of both sects are speaking from the same transcendental experience of Reality. The present text is written in a highly condensed form and includes sermons delivered on many different occasions. It is not improbable that paragraphs 29 and 30 are a summary of a sermon delivered to an audience including one or more distinguished Taoist scholars, especially as the opening sentence gives the impression that the Master was addressing newcomers to Zen.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-30a"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-30a">[30a]</a> This passage contains another famous Taoist term: WU WEI, sometimes mistranslated &quot;non-action&quot;. In fact, it means no calculated action, nothing but spontaneous actions required to meet the demands of the passing moment.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a class="endnote" id="note-30b"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-30b">[30b]</a> Literacy is by no means essential to the mastery of Zen. <em>The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation</em> makes the same point.

									<a class="endnote" id="note-36"></a><a class="send-back" href="#return-note-36">[36]</a> This passage has puzzled many a Chinese scholar. I am not sure that this translation conveys the meaning very well, but at least I have simplified the wording by using &quot;doctrine&quot; as well as &quot;dharma&quot;. In the original, the same word is used for both. A word-for-word translation would run something like this: &quot;Dharma original Dharma not Dharma, not Dharma Dharma also Dharma, now transmit not Dharma Dharma, Dharma Dharma how-can be Dharma.&quot; I have closely followed a rendering made for me some years ago by Mr. I. T. Pun, a famous Buddhist scholar resident in Hongkong. He admits that this version merely represents his own opinion, but it seems to me the best possible. In my previous published translation I failed lamentably.
