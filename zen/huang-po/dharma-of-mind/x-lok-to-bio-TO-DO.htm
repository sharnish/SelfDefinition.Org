Venerable Elder Master Lok To, the first President of the Buddhist Association of the United States from 1964 – 1974, passed away peacefully, surrounded by the Sangha and Lay Buddhist community.
</p><p>
Ven. Lok-To, was ordained as a novice monk at age 10. He was a disciple of the famous Ven. Tan Hsu of China. He came to the United States in 1963. After the establishment of the Buddhist Association of the United States, he had been the president for ten years, and resigned after the second term. During the year of his service, he had built a solid foundation for BAUS. He was also the one of the three founders of the Chamshan Temple in Toronto, Canada and the Young Men’s Buddhist Association of America. He mastered in English, and dedicated his time and energy on translation Buddhist text from Chinese to English. His work can be found through the website of “Young Men’s Buddhist Association of America.”

“1923 was the year of my birth. When I was very young I entered the school for priesthood of Buddhist. Six year later I was ordained. Tien-tai school and Ch’an practice (Zen in Japanese) are my basic training in Buddhism.
</p><p>
I received advanced study in Chan Shan Temple, Tsingtao, China. Hereafter I went to Hong Kong to attend the Hwa Nan Research Institute of Buddhism and completed my research fellowship few years later. While in Hong Kong, I served as director of the Chinese Buddhist Society and was in charge of the Chinese Buddhist library. In 1962 the institute of Buddhism and Taoism in San Francisco invited me to preach Buddhism in this country. One year later I came to New York. Together with a number of devoted Buddhists, the Buddhist Association of the United States was founded in New York in the December of 1964. I was elected as the President and a director of the association.
</p><p>
My aim of the association is to promote the study and practice of Buddhism, to search for the Truth and Enlightenment and to obtain better understanding among all the religions. It is our belief that by doing so mankind may bring the world lasting peace and true happiness.”

	We have lost two dharma masters in 2011. Although I never had a chance to meet Master Lok To （樂渡法師） in my fifteen years here at CYM, their presence is felt everywhere. Ven. Jen Chun （仁俊長老） was the former president of the Buddhist Association of the United States and the founder of Bodhi Monastery in New Jersey, as well as the founder of the Yin Shun Foundation. He passed away on February 9, 2011. In 1974 he moved to the US and was invited by BAUS to become the Abbot of the Temple of Enlightenment and Vice President of BAUS. He also served as president of BAUS from 1980-1984 and from 2002-2007. He worked tirelessly for the dharma, his disciples, his students and Buddhism. He was a disciple of Master Yin Shun （印順導師） and stressed not only the bodhisattva ideal, but a firm and deep understanding of the early teachings of Buddhism.

Venerable Master Lok To （樂渡法師） was the first President of BAUS from 1964-1974. He passed away on September 2, 2011. He was born in 1923 and ordained as a novice monk at the age of 10. He was a disciple of Venerable Tan Hsu （倓虛大師） of China. When I first came to CYM, and poured over the many free books laid out in the Great Buddha Hall I was amazed to see how many were actually written or translated by Venerable Lok To. He seemed to have taken a great responsibility in sharing the dharma at this early time. He laid the groundwork for many of the English translations we see today at CYM. Many of these books, I still cherish today.

Sometimes we tend to overlook our past. We loose sight of the many connections that make a place or an organization what it is. I liken it to Indra’s Net. The Net’s many jewels all reflecting and shining in each other. BAUS, CYM and the Temple of Enlightenment are all here today because of people in the past, the present and those that look to carry the dharma well into the future. This is true giving. This is Dependent Origination （Skt: Pratityasamutpada）. Masters Jen Chun （仁俊法師） and Lok To （樂渡法師）, as well as, CT Shen （沈家楨居士）, Venerable Ming Chi（敏智法師）, Venerable Xian Ming （顯明法師）, Venerable Ming Kuang （明光法師）, Venerable Sheng-Yen（聖嚴法師）, Venerable Taixu, Venerable Yinshun of the past, Venerable Ji-Xing（繼興法師）, Venerable Dhammadipa（法曜法師）, Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi （菩提比丘）and all the monks and nuns at CYM, the Trustees and Members of BAUS, my friends, the volunteers and employees in the present, each one a key component in Indra’s Net. We are all inter-connected.
