                            <h3>10. HIS FINAL INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
                            <p>One day the Patriarch sent for his disciplcs, Fat Hoi, Chi Shing, Fat Tat, Shin Wui, Chi Sheung, Chi Tung, Chi Chai, Chi Tao, Fat Chun, Fat U, etc., and addressed them as follows :&mdash;</p>
                            <p>&quot;You men are different from the common lot. After my entering into Parinirvana, each of you will be the Dhyana Master of a certain district. I am, therefore, going to give you some hints on preaching, so that when doing so, you may keep up the tradition of our School.</p>
                            <p>&quot;First mention the three categories of Dharmas, and then the thirty six 'pairs of opposites' in the activities (of the Essence of Mind). Then teach how to avoid the two extremes of 'coming in' or 'going out.' In all preaching, stray not from the Essence of Mind. Whenever a man puts a question to you, answer him in antonyms, so that a 'pair of opposites' will be formed. (For example), 'coming' and <sup>4</sup> 'going' are the reciprocal cause of each other; when the interdependence of the two is entirely done away with there would be, in the absolute sense, neither 'coming' nor 'going.' &quot;</p>
                            <p>
                                The three categories of Dharmas are:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>Skandhas (aggregates),</p>
                            <p>Ayatanas (places or spheres of meedng),</p>
                            <p>Dhatus (factors of consciousness).</p>
                            <p>The five Skhandhas are:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>Rupa (matter), Vedana (sensation), Samjna (perception), Samskara (tendencies of mind), and Vijnana (consciousness) .</p>
                            <p>The twelve Ayatanas are:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>Six Sense Objects (external) Six Sense Organs (internal) Object of sight ,&nbsp;Organ of sight</p>
                            <p>,,&nbsp;hearing&nbsp;„&nbsp;hearing</p>
                            <p><a href="#bookmark17">,,&nbsp;smell&nbsp;„&nbsp;smell</a></p>
                            <p><a href="#bookmark18">„&nbsp;taste&nbsp;,,&nbsp;taste</a></p>
                            <p><a href="#bookmark19">,,&nbsp;touch&nbsp;„&nbsp;touch</a></p>
                            <p>,,&nbsp;thought&nbsp;„&nbsp;thought</p>
                            <p>The eighteen&nbsp;Dhatus are:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>The six sense objects, six sense organs, and six recipient vijnanas.</p>
                            <p>&quot; Since the Essence of Mind is the embodiment of all Dharmas, it is called the Repository Consciousness (Alaya). But as soon as the process of thinking or reasoning is started, the Essence of Mind is transmuted into (various) vijnanas. When the six recipient vijnanas come into being, they perceive the six sense objects through the six 'doors' of sense). Thus, the functioning of the eighteen Dhatus derive their impetus from the Essence of Mind. Whether they function with an evil tendency or a good one depends upon that mood &mdash;good or evil&mdash;the Essence of Mind is in. Evil functioning is that of a common man, while good functioning is that of a Buddha. It is because there are 'pairs of opposites' inherent in the Essence of Mind that the functioning of the eighteen Dhatus derive their impetus therefrom. &quot;The thirty-six 'pairs of opposites' are:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>Five external inanimate ones: Heaven and earth, sun and moon, light and darkness, positive element and negative element, fire and water. Twelve Dharmalaksana (Phenomenal objects): Speech and Dharma, affirmation and negation, matter and non-matter, form and without form, taints (asravas) and absence of taint, matter and void, motion and quiescence, purity and foulness, ordinary people and sages, the Sangha and the laity, the aged and the young, the big and the small.</p>
                            <p>Nineteen pairs denoting the functioning of the Essence of Mind: Long and short, good and evil, infatuated and enlightened, ignorant and wise, perturbed and calm, merciful and wicked, abstinent (Sila) and indulgent, straight and crooked, full and empty, steep and level, Klesa and Bodhi, permanent and transient, compassionate and cruel, happy and angry, generous and mean, forward and backward, existent and non-existent, Dharmakaya and physical body, Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya.</p>
                            <p>&quot;He who knows how to use these thirty-six pairs realises the all-pervading principle which goes through the teaching of all Sutras. Whether he is 'coming in' or 'going out,' he is able to avoid the two extremes.</p>
                            <p>&quot;In the functioning of the Essence of Mind and in conversation with others, outwardly we should free ourselves from attachment to objects, whence come contact with objects; and inwardly, with regard to the teaching of the 'Void,' we should free ourselves from the idea of Nihilism. To believe in the reality of objects or in Nihilism would result in deep-rooted fallacious views or intensified ignorance respectively.</p>
                            <p>&quot;A bigoted believer in ISfihilism would blaspheme against the Sutras on the ground that literature (i.e., the Buddhist Scriptures) is unnecessary (for the study of Buddhism). If that were so, then neither would it be right for us to speak, since speech forms the substance of literature. He would also argue that in the direct method (literally, the straight Path)</p>
                            <p>He who is an adept in the discrimination of various Dharmalaksana Abides immovably in the 'First Principle' (Nirvana). Thus are all things to be perceived, And this is the functioning of Tathata (Suchncss). Treaders of the Path, Exert yourself and take heed That as followers of the Mahayana School You do not embrace that sort of knowledge Which binds you to the wheel of birth and death. With those who are sympathetic Let us have discussion on Buddhism. As for those whose point of view differs from ours Let us treat them politely and thus make them happy. (But) disputes are alien to our School, For they are incompatible with its doctrine. To be bigoted and to argue with others in disregard of this rule Is to subject one's Esscnce of Mind to the bitterness of mundane existence.</p>
                            <p>Having heard this stanza, the assembly made obeisance in a body. In accordance with the wishes of the Patriarch, all of them concentrated their minds to put the stanza into actual practice, and refrained from further religious controversy.</p>
                            <p>Seeing that the Patriarch would pass away in the near future, Elder Fat Hoi, after prostrating himself twice asked, &quot;Sir, upon your entering into Parinirvana, who will be the inheritor of the robe and the Dharma?&quot;</p>
                            <p>&quot;All my sermons,&quot; replied the Patriarch, &quot;from the time I preached in Tai Fan Monastery up to now, may be copied out for circulation in a volume to be entitled 'Sutra Spoken on the High Seat of the Treasure of the Law' (Dharmaratha). Take good care of it and hand it down from one generation to another for the salvation of all sentient beings. He who preaches in accordance with its teaching preaches the Orthodox Dharma.</p>
                            <p>&quot;So much for the Dharma. As to the transmission o£ the robe, this practice is to be discontinued. Why? Because you ail have implicit faith in my teaching, ana being free from all doubts you are able to carry out the lofty object o£ our School. Furthermore, according to the implied meaning of the stanza by Bodhiharma, the first Patriarch, on Law Transmission, the robe need not be handed down to posterity. The stanza reads:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>The object of my coming to this land (Le., China) Is to transmit the Law for the deliverance of those under delusion. In five petals the flower will be complete.&nbsp;,</p>
                            <p>Thereafter, the fruit will come to bearing naturally.</p>
                            <p>The Patriarch added, &quot;Learned Audience, purify your minds and listen to me. He who wishes to attain the All-knowing Knowledge of a Buddha should know the <sup>4</sup> Samadhi of Specific Object' and the 'Samadhi of Specific Mode.' In all circumstances we should free ourselves from attachment to objects, and our attitude towards them should be neutral and indifferent. Let neither success nor failure, neither profit nor loss, worry us. Let us be calm and serene, modest and accommodating, simple and dispassionate. Such is the 'Samadhi of Specific Object.' On all.occasions, whether we are standing, walking, sitting or reclining, let us be absolutely straightforward. Then, remaining in our sanctuary, and without the least movement, we shall virtually be in the Kingdom of Pure Land. Such is the 'Samadhi of Specific Mode.'</p>
                            <p>&quot;He who is complete with these two forms of Samadhi may be likened to the ground with seeds sown therein. Covered up in the mud, the seeds receive nourishment therefrom and grow until the fruit comes into bearing.</p>
                            <p>&quot;My preaching to you now may be likened to the seasonable rain which brings moisture to a vast area of land. The</p>
                            <p>Buddha-nature within you may be likened to the seed which, being moistened by the rain, will grow rapidly. He who carries out my instructions will certainly attain Bodhi. He who follows my teaching will certainly attain the superb fruit (or Buddhahood). Listen to my stanza:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>&quot;Buddha-seeds latent in our mind Will sprout upon the coming of the all-pervading rain. The 'flower' of the doctrine having been intuitively grasped. One is bound to reap the fruit of Enlightenment.&quot;</p>
                            <p>Then he added, &quot;The Dharma is non-dual and so is the mind. The Path is pure and above all forms. I warn you not to use those exercises for meditation on quietude or for keeping the mind a blank. The mind is by nature pure, so there is nothing for us to crave for or give up. Do your best, each of you, and go (to preach) wherever circumstances may lead.&quot;</p>
                            <p>Thereupon the disciples made obeisance and withdrew.</p>
                            <p>On the 8th day of the 7th Moon, the Patriarch gave a sudden order to his disciples to get ready a boat for his going back to Sun Chow (his native place). In a body they entreated him earnestly and pitifully to stay.</p>
                            <p>&quot;It is only natural that I should go,&quot; said the Patriarch, &quot;for death is the inevitable outcome of birth, and even the various Buddhas who appear in this world have to go through an earthly death before entering Parinirvana. There can be no exception for my physical body, which must be laid down somewhere.&quot;</p>
                            <p>&quot;After your visit to Sun Chow,&quot; entreated the assembly, &quot;please return here sooner or later.&quot;</p>
                            <p>&quot;Fallen leaves go back to where the root is, and when I first came, mouth I had not,&quot; replied the Patriarch.</p>
                            <p>Then they asked, &quot;To whom, Sir, do you transmit the Womb of the Eye of the Orthodox Law' ?&quot;</p>
                            <p>&quot;Men of principle will get it, and those who are free from arbitrary concepts (literally, mind-less) will understand it.&quot; They fu-.ther asked, &quot;Will any calamity befall you here-</p>
                            <p>after?&quot;</p>
                            <p>&quot;Five or six years after my death,&quot; replied the Patriarch, &quot;a certain man will come to cut off my head. I have made the following prophecy of which please take note:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>&quot;To the top of the parent's head, offerings are made, For the mouth must be fed. When the calamity of 'Mun' befalls. Young and Liu will be the officials.&quot;</p>
                            <p>He then added, &quot;Seventy years after my departure two Bodhisattvas from the East, one a layman and the other a Bhikkhu, will preach contemporaneously, disseminate the Law widely, establish our School on a firm basis, renovate our monasteries, and transmit the doctrine to numerous promising successors.&quot;</p>
                            <p>&quot;Can you let us know for how many generations the Dharma has been transmitted, from the appearance of the earliest Buddha up to now?&quot; asked the disciples.</p>
                            <p>&quot;The Buddhas who have appeared in this world are too many to be counted,&quot; replied the Patriarch. &quot;But let us start from the last seven Buddhas. They are:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>Buddha Vipassin</p>

                            <p>And I am the 33rd Patriarch (i.e., the 6th Patriarch in China). Thus, by pupillary succession, the Dharma was handed down from one Patriarch to another. Hereafter, you men should in turn transmit it to posterity by passing it on from one generation to another, so that the tradition may be maintained.</p>
                            <p>On the 3rd day of the 8th Moon of the year of Kwai Tsau, the 2nd Year of Sin Tin Era, after taking food at the Kwok Yen Monastery, the Patriarch addressed his disciples as follows:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>&quot;Please sit down in order of seniority, for I am going to say good-bye.&quot;</p>
                            <p>Thereupon Fat Hoi spoke to the Patriarch, &quot;Sir, will you please leave to posterity definite instructions whereby people under delusion may realise the Buddha-nature.&quot;</p>
                            <p>&quot;It is not impossible,&quot; replied the Patriarch, &quot;for these men to realise the Buddha-nature, provided they acquaint themselves with the nature of ordinary sentient beings. But to seek Buddhahood without such knowledge would be in vain even if one shall spend seons of time in the search.</p>
                            <p>&quot;Now, let me show you how to get acquainted with the nature of the sentient beings within your mind, and thereby realise the Buddha-nature latent in you. Knowing Buddha means nothing else than knowing sentient beings; for it is the latter who ignore that they are Buddhas in potentiality, whereas a Buddha sees no difference between himself and other beings. When sentient beings realise the Essence of Mind, they are Buddhas. If a Buddha is under delusion in his Essence of Mind, he is then an ordinary being. Purity in the Essence of Mind makes ordinary beings Buddhas. Impurity in the Essence of Mind reverts even a Buddha to an ordinary being. When your mind is crooked or depraved, you are ordinary beings with Buddha-nature latent in you. On the other hand, when you direct your mind to purity and straightforwardness even for one moment, you are a Buddha.</p>
                            <p>&quot;Within our mind there is a Buddha, and that Buddha within is the real Buddha. If Buddha is not to be sought within our mind, where shall we find the real Buddha? Doubt not that Buddha is within your mind, apart from which nothing can exist. Since all things or phenomena are the production of our mind, the Sutra says, 'When mental activity begins, various things come into being; when mental activity ceases, they too cease to exist.' In parting from you, let me leave you a stanza entitled 'The Real Buddha of the Essence of Mind.' People of future generations who understand its meaning will realise the Essence of Mind and attain Buddhahood accordingly. It reads :&mdash;</p>
                            <p>&quot;The Essence of Mind or Tathata (Suchness) is the real Buddha, While heretical views and the three poisonous elements arc Mara (Satan).</p>
                            <p>Enlightened by Right Views, we call forth the Buddha within us.</p>
                            <p>When our nature is dominated by the three poisonous elements as</p>
                            <p>a result of heretical views We are said to be possessed by Mara;</p>
                            <p>But when Right Views eliminate from our mind these poisonous elements,</p>
                            <p>Mara will be transformed into a real Buddha. The Dharmakaya, the Sambhogakaya, and the Nirmanakaya&mdash; These three Bodies emanate from one (i.e., the Essence of Mind). He who is able to realise this fact intuitively Has sown the seed, and will reap the fruit of Enlightenment. It is from the Nirmanakaya that our 'Pure Nature' emanates; Within the former the latter is always to be found. Guided by 'Pure Nature,' the Nirmanakaya treads the Right Path, And will some day attain to the Sambhogakaya, perfect and infinite.</p>
                            <p>'Pure Nature' is an outgrowth of our sensual instincts; By getting rid of sensually, wc attain the Pure Dharmakaya. When our temperament is such that we are no longer the slaves</p>
                            <p>of the five sense-objects, And when we have realised the Essence of Mind even for one</p>
                            <p>Ksana only, then Truth is known to us. Should we be so fortunate as to be the followers of the Sudden</p>
                            <p>School in this life, In a sudden we shall see the Bhagavat of our Essence of Mind. He who seeks the Buddha (from without) by practising certain doctrines</p>
                            <p>Knows not where the real Buddha is to be found. He who is able to realise the Truth within his own mind Has sown the seed of Buddhahood.</p>
                            <p>He who has not realised the Essence of Mind and seeks the Buddha</p>
                            <p>from without Is a fool motivated by wrong desires.</p>
                            <p>I have hereby left to posterity the teaching of the Sudden School For the salvation of all sentient beings who care to practise it. Hear me, ye future disciples!</p>
                            <p>Your time will have been badly wasted if you neglcct to put this teaching into practice.&quot;</p>
                            <p>Having recited the stanza, he added, &quot;Take good care of yourselves. After my passing away, do not follow the worldly tradition, and cry or lament. Neither should messages of condolence be accepted, nor mourning be worn. These things are contrary to the Orthodox Teaching, and he who does them is not my disciple. What you should do is to know your own mind and realise your own Buddha-nature, which neither rests nor moves, neither becomes nor ceases to be, neither comes nor goes, neither affirms nor denies, neither stays nor departs. Lest your mind should be under delusion and thus fail to catch my meaning, I repeat this to you to enable you to realise your Essence of Mind. After my death, if you carry out my instructions and practise them accordingly, my being away from you will make no difference. On the other hand, if you go against my teaching, no benefit would be obtained, even I continued to stay here.&quot;</p>
                            <p>Then he uttered another stanza:&mdash;</p>
                            <p>Imperturbable and serene the ideal man practises no virtue.</p>
                            <p>Self-possessed and dispassionate, he commits no sin.</p>
                            <p>Calm and silent, he gives up seeing and hearing.</p>
                            <p>Even and upright his mind abides nowhere.</p>
                            <p>Having uttered the stanza, he sat reverently until the third watch of the night. Then he said abruptly to his disciples, &quot;I am going now,&quot; and in a sudden passed away. A peculiar fragrance pervaded his room, and a lunar rainbow appeared which seemed to join up earth and sky. The trees in the wood turned white, and birds and beasts cried mournfully.</p>
                            <p>In the 11th Moon of that year the question of the Patriarch's resting place gave rise to a dispute among the government officials of Kwong Chow, Shiu Chow and Sun Chow, each party being anxious to have the remains of the Patriarch removed to its own district. The Patriarch's disciples, together with other Bhikkhus and laymen, took part in the controversy. Being unable to come to any settlement among themselves, they burnt incense and prayed to the Patriarch to indicate by the direction of the drift of the smoke the place which he himself would choose. As the smoke turned directly to Tso Kai, the shrine (in which the body was kept) together with the inherited robe and bowl was accordingly taken back there on the 13th day of the 11th Moon.</p>
                            <p>Next year, on the 25th day of the 7th Moon, the body was taken out of the shrine, and Fong Pin, a disciple of the Patriarch, plastered it with incense-clay. Recollecting the Patriarch's prediction that some one would take away his head, the disciples, as a matter of precaution, strenghtened his neck by wrapping it with iron sheets and lacquered cloth before the body was placed into the stupa. Suddenly, a flash of white light rushed out from, the stupa, went up straight towards the sky, and did not disperse until three days after. The incident was duly reported to the Throne by the officials of Shiu Chow District. By imperial order, tablets were erected to record the life of the Patriarch.</p>
                            <p>The Patriarch inherited the robe when he was 24, had his hair shaved (i.e., was ordained) at 39, and died at the age of 7G. For thirty-se&nbsp;'&nbsp;<sup>1 1</sup> ''' '</p>

They were to be kept permanently in Po Lam Monastery to guard the welfare of the temple. The Sutra spoken by the Patriarch was published and circulated to make known the principles and objects of the Dharma School. All these steps were taken for the prosperity of the 'Three Gems' (i.e., Buddha, Law, and Order) as well as for the general welfare of all sentient beings.</p>
