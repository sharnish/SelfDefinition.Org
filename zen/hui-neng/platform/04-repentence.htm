                            <p>
                                AT ONE TIME there was a large gathering of literary men and commoners gathered from Kwong-chow, Shiu-chow and other places, to listen to the Patriarch's words at his monastery of Tso-kai. The Patriarch ascended his platform and delivered the following address:&ndash;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Come, good people. In Buddhism we should start from our Essence of Mind. Let us purify our minds always and from one momentary sensation to another. Let us follow the Path by our own effort, recognise our own Essence-body, realise that our own mind is Buddha, and free ourselves by a voluntary observance of the disciplinary rules,&ndash;then this gathering will not be in vain. You have all come from distant places: and your gathering here shows the affinity that exists among us. Let us now sit down together in the Indian fashion for Dhyana, while I first lead you in the ritual of Repentance (<em>Ksamayati</em>).
                            </p>
                            <p class="pagenum">
                                p. 258
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When they were seated the Patriarch continued:&ndash;The first is the Sila Incense (Behavior), which symbolises that our minds are free from all taint of misdeeds, evil, jealousy, avarice, anger, spoilation and hatred. The second is Samadhi Incense, which symbolises that our mind is serene under all circumstances--favorable or unfavorable. The third is Prajñā Incense, which means that our minds are free from all impediments; that we constantly seek to realise our Mind-essence with wisdom; that we refrain from all evil; that we do all kinds of good acts with no attachment to the fruit of such action; and that we are respectful toward our superiors, considerate of our inferiors, and sympathetic for the destitute and those in trouble. The fourth is the Incense of Liberation, which means that our minds are in such a perfectly free state that they cling to nothing and bother themselves neither with good nor evil. The fifth is the Incense of "Knowledge gained because of the attainment of Liberation." When our minds cling to neither good nor evil, we should take care not to let them go to the other extreme of vacuity and remain in a state of inertia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this point we should study and seek to broaden our knowledge so that we can understand our own minds, thoroughly understand the principles of Buddhism, be considerate of others in our dealings with them, get rid of the idea of "self" and "existence," and realise that up to the time when we obtain enlightenment (<em>Bodhi</em>) our true nature (<em>Tathata</em>) is immutable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Learned Audience:&ndash;This five-fold Incense perfumes us from within; we should not seek it without.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now I want to explain to you this Ritual of Repentance which is designed to expiate our sins whether committed in the present, the past or future lives; and whether physical, or by word, or by thought. (In Buddhist thought, sin is considered not in a legal sense as something to be punished, or forgiven, or atoned for by sacrifice, but in its cause-and-effect aspect of Karma and its maturing.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Please follow me carefully and repeat together what I am going to say. May we, disciples (from such and such a village), be always free from the taint of ignorance and delusion. We repent of all our past, present and future sins and evil deeds committed under delusion or in ignorance. May their karma be expiated at once and may they never rise again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                May we, disciples (from such and such a village), be always free from taint of arrogance and dishonesty. We repent of all our past, present and future evil deeds done in an arrogant or dishonest spirit. May their karma be expiated at once and may they never rise again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                May we, disciples (from such and such a village), be always free from taint of envy and jealousy. We repent of all our past, present and future evil deeds done in an envious or jealous spirit. May their karma be expiated at once and may they never rise again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As you will notice, there are two aspects to this repentance ritual: One refers to repentance for past sin; we ought to repent for all our past sins and evil deeds committed under delusion or ignorance, arrogance or dishonesty, jealousy or envy, so as to put an end to all of them. This is one aspect of repentance. The other aspect refers to future conduct. Having realised the evil nature of our transgression we make a vow that hereafter we will put an end to all evil deeds committed under delusion or ignorance, arrogance or dishonesty, envy or jealousy, and that we will never sin again. This is the second aspect of repentance. On account of ignorance and delusion, common people do not always appreciate that in repentance they must not only feel sorry for their past sins, but must also refrain from sinning in the future. Since they often take no heed as to their future conduct, they commit the same sins over again almost before the past ones are expiated. How can we call that repentance?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Learned Audience: Having repented of our sins, we should take the following all-embracing vows: Listen very carefully:&ndash;
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Our Mind-essence is potential of an infinite number of sentient beings. We vow to bring them all unto deliverance.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We vow to get rid of the evil passions of our minds, inexhaustible though they seem.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We vow to learn the countless systems of Dharma in our Mind-essence.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We vow to attain the Supreme Buddhahood of our Mind-essence.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                We have now vowed to deliver an infinite number of sentient beings; but what does that mean? It does not mean that I, Hui-neng is going to deliver them. And who are these sentient beings, potential within our minds? They are the delusive mind, the deceitful mind, the evil mind, and such like &ndash; all these are sentient beings. Each of them has to be delivered by oneself by means of his own Essence of Mind; only by his own deliverance, is it genuine.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now, what does it mean, &quot;delivering oneself by one's own Essence of Mind?&quot; It means the deliverance of the ignorant, delusive, and the vexatious beings that spring up within our own mind, by means of Right Views. With the aid of Right Views and Prajñā, the barriers thrown up by these delusive and ignorant beings may be broken down; so that each of us will be in a position to deliver himself by his own efforts. The false will be delivered by truthfulness; the delusive by enlightenment; the ignorant by wisdom; and the malevolent by benevolence; such is genuine deliverance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As to the vow; "to get rid of the inexhaustible evil passions," that refers to the transcendence of our unreliable and illusive thinking faculty by the transcendental Wisdom (Prajñā) of our Mind-essence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As to the vow: "to learn the countless systems of Dharma"; there will be no true knowledge until we have been brought face to face with our Essence of Mind, by our conforming to the orthodox Dharma on all occasions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As to the vow, "to attain Supreme Buddahood"; I wish to point out that when we are able to control our mind to follow the true and orthodox Dharma on all occasions, and when Prajñā always rises in our minds, so that we can hold aloof from both ignorance and enlightenment, and can do away with falsehood as well as truth, then we may consider ourselves as having realised our Buddha-nature, or, in other words, having attained Buddhahood.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Learned Audience: we should always bear in mind that we are following the Path, for thereby strength is added to our vows. Now, since we have all taken the four-fold vows, I will teach you the Ritual of the threefold Guidance.

                                To take refuge in Enlightenment so that evil and delusive notions do not arise, so that desire decreases, discontent becomes unknown, and lust and greed no longer bind us &ndash; this is the fruitage of Punya and Prajñā.

                                To take refuge in Orthodoxy so that from momentary sensation to another we will be free from wrong views &ndash; this is the best means of getting rid of desires.

                            <p>
                                To take refuge in Purity so that no matter under what circumstance we may be, we will not become contaminated by wearisome sense objects, by craving nor by desire &ndash; this is the noblest quality of mankind.

                                To practise the "Three-fold Guidance" as thus outlined means to take refuge in one's Mind-essence. Ignorant people often take the "Three-fold Guidance" without understanding it. They say that they take refuge in Buddha: do they know where he is? If they cannot conceive Buddha, how can they take refuge in him? Would not such an assertion amount to self-deception?

                                Each of you should examine this point for himself, so that his energy may not be misapplied through ignorance. The Sutra distinctly says that each should take refuge in the Buddha within himself. It does not refer to any other Buddhas; hence if we do not take refuge in the Buddha of our own Mind-essence, there is nowhere else for us to go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having cleared this point, let each of us take refuge in the "Three jewels" of his own mind. Within, each should control his own mind; without, each should be respectful toward others &ndash; this is the way to take refuge within ourselves.

                                I have a stanza, the reciting and practising of which will at once dispel the delusions and expiate the sins accumulated during many kalpas. This is the stanza:&ndash;
                            </p>
                            <p class="blockquote">
                                People under delusion accumulate tainted merit but tread not the Path.
                                <br /> They are under the illusion that to accumulate merit and to tread the Path are one and the same thing.
                                <br /> Their merit for alms-giving and offerings may be infinite,
                                <br /> But they fail to realise that the ultimate source of sin lies in the greed, hatred and infatuation within their own mind.
                                <br /> They expect to expiate their sin by the accumulation of merit,
                                <br /> Without knowing that the felicities to be gained thereby in future lives.

                                <br /> If we get rid of the sin within our own mind
                                <br /> Then it is a case of true repentance.
                                <br /> One who realises suddenly what constitutes true repentance in the Mahayana sense,
                                <br /> And who ceases to do evil and practises righteousness, is free from sin.

                                <br /> Enlightened by Right Views, we call forth the Buddha within us.
                                <br /> When our nature is dominated by the three poisonous elements, as the result of heretical views,

                                <br /> But when Right Views free our minds of these poison elements,
                                <br /> Mara will, be transformed into a real Buddha.
                                <br /> A follower of the Path who keeps constant watch on his Mind-essence
                                <br /> Is in the same class with the many Buddhas.

If you succeed in realising Essence of Mind, then you may think of yourselves as being in my presence though you may be a thousand miles away. But should you be unable to do so, though we were face to face with each other, we would really be thousands of miles apart. In that case what is the use of your taking the trouble to come here from such a long distance? Take good care of yourselves. I bid you good-bye.

In the text of the Discourse on Repentance there is a section on "The Three-fold Body of Buddha" which is evidently out of place. <span class="note">[See next chapter, as noted below.]</span> In the first place, the Discourse was delivered to a gathering of "Literary Men and Commoners," while the Three-body Discourse, being very metaphysical, is evidently intended for his advanced disciples. Moreover, while the prose section of the Repentance section has its following stanza, the Three-body section has none; but strange to say, there is a stanza quite appropriate to it inserted in the Patriarch's final words just before his death, where it is entirely out of place. The editor has taken the liberty of bringing the prose section and the stanza together in a chapter by themselves, which will follow this chapter.
