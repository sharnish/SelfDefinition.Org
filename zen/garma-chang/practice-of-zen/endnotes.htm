										means "flower-ornament" or "beautiful garland," denoting the title of an
										important Mahayana scripture called the <em>Hua Yen Chin</em> or the <em>Garland
											Sutra</em> (Sanskrit: <em>Avatamsaka Sutra</em>). <sup>[1]</sup>
									</p>
									<p class="fnote">
										[1. Link opens a 108 page pdf (549K) on this site: <a href="/buddhism/Garland-Sutra-Avatamsaka-Sutra.pdf">/buddhism/<wbr />Garland-Sutra-Avatamsaka-Sutra.pdf </a>&nbsp;]
									</p>
									<p>
										Because the system and tenets of this philosophy are based upon the <em>Hua
											Yen</em> or <em>Garland Sutra,</em> it has been called "The philosophy of
										Hua Yen." This philosophy was established by the founder of the Hua Yen School,
										Master Tu Hsun of the Tang Dynasty, and has been generally considered as one of
										the greatest achievements of Chinese Buddhist scholarship.
									</p>
									<p>
										At present, <span class="note">[1959]</span> neither a translation of the
										original text of the <em>Garland Sutra</em> nor of its exegeses and commentaries
										is available in European languages. <span class="note">[but see above]</span>
										The personal opinion of the author is that unless the texts of this
										<em>Sutra</em> are studied, one can hardly understand the spirit and philosophy
										of Mahayana Buddhism at its highest level and in its profoundest sense. The
										<em>Hua Yen Sutra</em> is, indeed, as the Chinese Buddhist proverb has said,
										"the King of all sutras."
									</p>
									<p>
										It is our high hope that this supreme sutra, together with its commentaries,
										will soon be translated into the English language. At present the reader may
										refer to D. T. Suzuki's excellent book, <em>The Essence of Buddhism,</em>
										<sup>[out of print]</sup> wherein some basic tenets of the Hua Yen philosophy
										are introduced. Briefly speaking, Hua Yen philosophy is the philosophy of
										<em>totality,</em> the elucidation of the unfathomable Realm of Buddhahood and
										the brave spirit and profound understanding of the Bodhisattvas &ndash; those
										persons who strive for Enlightenment in order to save sentient beings.

										According to the Yogacara philosophy (Buddhist Idealism), the consciousness
										possessed by each sentient being has eight different functional aspects which
										are conveniently designated as the "Eight Consciousnesses." Of these, the first
										five are the Consciousness of the Eye, of the Ear, of the Nose, of the Tongue,
										and of the Body. The sixth is called "The Consciousness of Discrimination," the
										seventh, "The Consciousness of Constant Thought" or "Ego," and the eighth, the
										<em>Alaya</em> or "Store Consciousness." See Chapter II, p. 72, "The Discourse
										of Master Hsu Yun."

										phrase is very difficult to translate. <em>Ta</em> means "great," and
										<em>chi</em> means "the critical point, time, or event." <em>Chi</em> can also
										mean "cleverness," "adroitness," or "opportunity," when combined with other
										words such as <em>chi chiao</em> or <em>chi hui.</em> <em>Ta chi</em> thus means
										"great opportunity," "great cleverness," "flexibility," or "crisis," implying
										that the Zen Master knows how to instruct his disciples under different
										circumstances with great skill and flexibility. When <em>ta yung,</em> meaning
										"great power and capability," is combined with <em>ta chi,</em> the phrase
										becomes more expressive and forceful.

										Practice as suggested by Zen Master Yuan Chin are considered to be of great
										significance, but some of them are very enigmatic, especially points 3 and 6.
										Detailed commentaries on the text are not available at this time. The following
										brief explanations or interpretations of points 3, 5, and 6 may be helpful,
										however:
									</p>
									<p>
										a. Point 3: When one reaches the state of <em>Satori,</em> he experiences all,
										and all is embraced by and identical with, the Great Tao. Both sentient and
										insentient beings are alive in this "Great Whole." Thus even insentient beings
										are capable of preaching the Dharma.
									</p>
									<p>
										b. Point 5: The distinguishing "Eye of Dharma" means the capability of making
										correct discriminations and evaluations of all teachings and all things.
									</p>
									<p>
										c. Point 6: The meaning of this point is very obscure. The translator presumes
										that the "Path of the Birds" and the "Road of Beyond," or "Road of Wonder,"
										suggest that advanced yogis should live in solitude for a time in order to
										mature their Zen realization.

										of Buddha. They are: the <em>Dharmakaya,</em> the <em>Sambhogakaya,</em> and the
										<em>Nirmanakaya.</em> The <em>Dharmakaya</em> is the self-nature of Buddha,
										while the <em>Sambhogakaya</em> and <em>Nirmanakaya</em> are manifestations of
										Buddha. The <em>Dharmakaya</em> is the void and abstract aspect, and the
										<em>Sambhogakaya</em> and <em>Nirmanakaya</em> are the active dynamic aspects.

										<a class="endnote" id="chapter-1-12"></a><a href="ch-1c-four-vital-points.htm#return-ch-1c-note-12" class="send-back-link">[Ch-1-Note-12]</a> The original text of this sentence
										as found in the <em>Ch'an Yuan Meng Chiao,</em> and in the <em>Chih Yueh
											Lu,</em> is very obscure in its meaning: hence different interpretations may
										be given to it. The translator's opinion is that "the subject matter of the One
										Form" (Chinese: <em>I se Pien Shih</em>), referred to by the Chief Monk, implied
										his understanding of "a length of white silk" as being the illumination
										experience that one attains in the advanced stage of Dhyana. This
										"understanding" was disapproved and discredited by the challenging monk, Chiu
										Feng. D. T. Suzuki, in his <em>An Introduction to Zen Buddhism</em> (p. 115),
										renders this story in quite a different manner. In the last paragraph of the
										story, as rendered by Suzuki (p. 115, lines 21 to 27), there appears to be some
										distortion of the original text. For instance, in line 23, "As to getting into a
										trance [<em>tso t'o li wong</em>] you have shown a splendid example," is
										definitely a mistranslation. The Chinese phrase <em>tso t'o</em> means to
										"liberate [oneself in] the sitting posture," and <em>li wong</em> means to "die
										while standing up." The whole phrase implies the capability of passing away at
										will in a sitting or standing posture. Though <em>li wong</em> may also be
										interpreted as "die right away," because the Chinese word <em>li</em> could also
										imply <em>li k'o</em> meaning "at once," it should not be so interpreted in this
										case. Furthermore, <em>tso t'o li wong</em> is a technical Zen phrase widely
										used by all Buddhists. It has never meant "getting into a trance," as Suzuki
										suggests. (The original Chinese text of this story is given on p. 243, under
										"Chinese Characters for the Notes," Chapter I, Footnote 12.)

										(pronounced "ee-chin"). This is a very important Zen term meaning
										"doubt-sensation" or the feeling of doubt.
									</p>
									<p>
										The whole system of koan exercises is based upon the generation, and then the
										breakthrough, of this "doubt-sensation." "Doubt," as used here, is not doubt in
										the ordinary sense of the word; it is, rather, a special type of doubt &ndash; a
										doubt without content &ndash; or, more succinctly, the pure sensation of "doubt"
										per se. Sometimes the Zen Buddhists also use the term "doubt-mass" (Chinese:
										<em>I t'uan</em>) to denote that this sensation is like a great mass or load
										weighing upon one's mind. Though <em>I chin</em> in its original usage denotes
										the sensation of doubt brought about by the koan exercise, Master Po Shan
										<sup class="black">[this chapter]</sup> seemed
										to have used it in his discourse in a much wider sense, not only denoting the
										preliminary sensation of doubt originally suggested by the term, but also
										including almost all the advanced Zen experiences brought forth by the koan
										exercises.

										phrase denoting the advanced stage of Enlightenment. One who has reached this
										stage not only realizes the void aspect (allegorically, death), but also the
										dynamic aspect (allegorically, life) of being &ndash; seeing them as a whole.
										This realization of the dynamic vitality of all things is what Zen calls "The
										Great Revival" (Chinese: <em>Ta Huo</em>).

										term is used in a special sense denoting an "all-free" sensation that Zen
										practitioners experience. Although "flexible hollowness" is not a very

										different grades of sentient beings. The highest domain is called "The Domain of

										the expression of different states of consciousness. The second domain is called
										"The Domain of Form." Sentient beings of this domain have bodily form, but no
										desires or lusts. The third domain is called "The Domain of Desires." Sentient
										beings of this domain have many different kinds of desires and fears. Animals,
										human beings, beings in Hell, and those in certain regions of Heaven all belong
										to this "Domain of Desire." Sentient beings of the two upper Domains, namely,
										the "Domain of Form" and the "Domain of Non-form," are those who have gained
										various stages of <em>Samadhi.</em> Their states of consciousness vary greatly,
										from the consciousness state of the First <em>Dhyana</em> to that of the Eighth
										<em>Dhyana.</em> <sup>[4]</sup> Having absorbed themselves in the great Ecstasy
										and Illumination, these sentient beings consider themselves to have reached
										<em>Nirvana.</em> But the truth is that they are only indulging themselves in an

										these states to be of little value or significance.

										consciousness. In contrast to Dharmapala's theory of four portions, Sthiramati's
										is much clearer and simpler. The four-portion theory as propounded by Dharmapala
										seems to be redundant and it has been criticized by a number of Yogacara
										scholars in recent years. Some explanation of the four portions is given by
										Junjiro Taka-kusu, <em>The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy</em> (Honololu:
										University of Hawaii, 1947), p. 88. The reader is also referred to p. 89, where
										the three object-realms which are in close relation with the four-portions
										theory are explained. However, Takakusu's explanation of the object-realm of
										mere shadow is too concise and thus misleading:
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										"... 2. The object-domain of mere shadow or illusion. The shadow-image appears
										simply from one's own imagination and has no real existence. Of course, it has
										no original substance as a ghost which does not exist at all. Only the sixth,
										sensecenter, functions on it and imagines it to be."</blockquote>
									<p>
										This passage gives the impression that the Sixth Consciousness &ndash; the most
										active and versatile among the Eight Consciousnesses &ndash; which people
										generally call "mind," is a faculty which senses solely the delusive images.
										This is not true. The <em>Pa Shih Kuei Chu Sung,</em> by Hsuan Chuang, explains
										the Sixth Consciousness in relation to the three object-realms in the following
										sentence: "It includes the three natures, three measurements and also three
										object domains." This sentence describes the Sixth Consciousness as embracing
										all the three natures &ndash; good, bad, and neutral; the three measurements
										&ndash; direct, indirect, and erroneous; and the three object realms of nature,
										of mere shadow, and of the original substance. Thus we know that the Sixth
										Consciousness functions not merely on the delusive images which
										characteristically belong to the erroneous measurement but also functions on the
										object-realm of nature which belongs to the direct measurement, and in some
										cases on the object of the original substance.

										follows:
									</p>
									<p>
										"Although it is not necessary to expound here all the many aspects of the
										doctrine, one of the more important of them should receive some attention,
										namely, 'the reciprocal character of mind and <em>Prana</em>,' which means that
										a certain type of mind or mental activity is invariably accompanied by a
										<em>Prana</em> of corresponding character, whether transcendental or mundane.
										For instance, a particular mood, feeling, or thought is always accompanied,
										manifested, or reflected by a <em>Prana</em> or breathing of corresponding
										character and rhythm. Thus anger produces not merely an inflamed
										thought-feeling, but also a harsh and accentuated 'roughness' of breathing. On
										the other hand, when there is calm concentration on an intellectual problem, the
										thought and the breathing exhibit a like calmness. When the concentration is in
										a state of profound thinking, as during an effort to solve a subtle problem,
										unconsciously the breath is held. When one is in a mood of danger, pride, envy,
										shame, arrogance, love, lust, and so on, simultaneously there arises the 'air,'
										or <em>Prana</em>, of anger, pride, envy, shame, arrogance, love, lust, and so
										on; and this 'air' can be felt immediately within oneself. In deep Samadhi no
										thought arises; so there is no perceptible breathing. At the initial moment of
										enlightenment, which is also the moment of the total transformation of normal
										consciousness, the <em>Prana</em>, too, undergoes a revolutionary
										transformation. Accordingly, every mood, thought, and feeling, whether simple,
										subtle, or complex, is accompanied by a corresponding or reciprocal
										<em>Prana</em>.
									</p>
									<p>
										"In the higher states of meditation, the circulation of the blood is slowed down
										almost to cessation, perceptible breathing ceases, and the yogi experiences some
										degree of illumination, or 'brightness,' together with the thoughtfree state of
										mind. Then not only does a change of consciousness occur, but also a change in
										the physiological functioning of the body. In the body of a fully enlightened
										being, the breathing, the pulse, the circulatory and nerve systems are quite
										different from those of ordinary men. Much evidence in support of this fact is
										available from Hindu, Tibetan, and Chinese sources."

										sense it implies the "city" or "residence" of a specific deity. This "City of
										Buddha" is usually depicted with a chief Buddha in the center and a number of
										escorting deities placed in a circle around him. The over-all picture of a
										Tantric <em>Mandala</em> is strikingly similar to that of the structure of an
