                                To understand this matter [Zen] requires great determination and earnestness, for as soon as you have them, the real doubt-sensation will arise. [At times] you will doubt this and doubt that &ndash; the doubt automatically and instinctively arising by itself. From dawn to dusk it sticks to you from your head to your feet. It becomes one whole, continuous piece which will not be dislodged, no matter how hard you attempt to shake it. Even though you try to push it away, it will still persist in sticking to you. At all times it manifests itself clearly before you. Now this is when you can progress. On reaching this stage one should keep his mind straight and refrain from having secondary thoughts. When one finds himself not knowing that he is walking while walking or sitting while sitting, and unconscious of cold, heat, hunger &ndash; then he is about to reach home [Enlightenment]. Henceforth he will be able to catch up and hold on. [He does not have to do anything] but wait until the time comes. But do not let this remark influence you to wait idly, nor excite you to exert yourself &ndash; striving for such a state with anxious mind. Nor should you just let go and give up. Rather, you should preserve your mindfulness, keeping it steady until you reach Enlightenment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At times you will encounter eighty-four thousand soldier demons waiting their chance before the gate of your six organs. <a class="return-anchor" id="return-ch-2c5-note-38"></a><sup><a href="endnotes.htm#chapter-2-38">[Endnote 2-38]</a></sup> The projections of your mind will appear before you in the guise of good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, strange or astonishing visions. The slightest clinging to these things will entrap you into enslavement to their commands and directions. You will then talk and act as a devil. Thenceforth the right cause of <em>Prajna</em> will die away forever, and the seed of <em>Bodhi</em> will never sprout. At such a time you should refrain from stirring up your mind, and should make yourself like a living corpse. Then, as you hold on and on, suddenly and abruptly you will feel as though you were being crushed to pieces. You will then reach a state which will frighten the heavens and shake the earth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I joined the priesthood at fifteen and was ordained at twenty, staying at the monastery of Chin Tzu. I vowed to learn Zen within three years. First I worked under Master Tuan Chiao. He taught me to work on the <em>Hua Tou,</em> "Where was I before birth, and where will I be after death?" [I followed his instructions and practiced, but could not concentrate my mind because of the bifurcation in this very <em>Hua Tou.</em>] My mind was also scattered.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later I saw Master Hsueh Yen. He taught me to observe the "Wu" word. He also requested me to report to him each day. Explaining that this was like setting out on a journey, he said one should find out every day what progress one had made. Because his explanations were so systematic and understandable, [I became so dependent on him that] I did not make any effort in my own work. One day, when I had just entered his room, he said to me, "Who has dragged this corpse here for you?" He had hardly finished this sentence when he chased me out of his room.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later I followed the example of Chin Shan and stayed in the meditation hall. One day in a dream I suddenly remembered the koan, "All things are reducible to one, but to what is the one reducible?" At that moment a "doubt-sensation" abruptly arose within me so that I did not know east from west or north from south. During the sixth day in this state, while I was chanting prayers with the assembly, I lifted my head and saw the last two sentences of the stanza composed by the Fifth Patriarch, Fa Yan: <a class="return-anchor" id="return-ch-2c5-note-39"></a><sup><a href="endnotes.htm#chapter-2-39">[Endnote 2-39]</a></sup>
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Oh, it is you, the fellow<br />
                                    I have known all the time.<br />
                                    Who goes and returns<br />
                                    In the thirty thousand days of one hundred years!
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Immediately I broke up the sentence: "Who has dragged this corpse here for you?" (For it had stuck in my mind since the day Master Hsueh Yen had put it before me.) I felt as if my spirit had been extinguished and my mind blown away and then revived again from death itself. It was like dropping the burden of a carrying pole weighing twenty pounds! I was then twenty-four years old, and so had achieved my original wish to realize Zen within three years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Afterwards I was asked, "Can you master yourself in the bright daytime?" I answered, "Yes, I can." "Can you master yourself when dreaming?" Again my answer was, "Yes, I can." "Where, in dreamless sleep, is the Master?" To this question I had no answer or explanation. The Master said to me, "From now on I do not want you to study Buddhism or learn the Dharma, nor to study anything, either old or new. I just want you to eat when you are hungry and to sleep when you are tired. As soon as you wake from sleep, alert your mind and ask yourself, "Who is the very Master of this awakening, and where does he rest his body and lead his life?'
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I then made up my mind that I would understand this thing in one way or another even though it meant that I should appear to be an idiot for the rest of my life. Five years passed. One day, when I was questioning this matter while sleeping, my brother monk who slept beside me in the dormitory pushed his pillow so that it fell with a heavy thump to the floor. At that moment my doubts were suddenly broken up. I felt as if I had jumped out of a trap. All the puzzling koans of the Masters and the Buddhas and all the different issues and events of both present and ancient times became transparently clear to me. Henceforth all things were settled; nothing under the sun remained but peace.
