                            <p>
                                You have understood me very clearly. We have given a name to our problem -- egocentricity. You have this disease &amp; I see you have it. I am the doctor and have cured cases before. So the thing to do is clear-cure it. And you "thank me for my efforts." And you say that prior to my last letter you "made statements" &amp; my treatment consisted in saying "you are full of bologna."&nbsp;(a)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You make the widest (&amp; truest!!) generalization: "The M. knows that one too," but <em>IN DETAIL</em> you are (probably of necessity, my poor friend!!) forced to <em>act against your own words</em> because you are so trying to watch the process of your own deliverance!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hence the "analysis" like (a) above (knocking down all statements).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But IF WHAT YOU SAY WERE TRUE then any Tom, Dick or Harry -- &amp; in particular the "Dick" that is you, <em>could set up in business as an A.P.</em> (not "Alfred Pulyan" but "awakened person"!) and have an orgy of destruction, name-calling, epithet-inventing, &amp; so forth, while looking hopefully to CURING his dupes. But, physician heal thyself!! It might not work. In <em>rare</em> cases it might! But, oh boy, what a mess --- what a fight! However there are quite a number of people who <em>do</em> habitually act this way; in a mild degree Groucho Marx, Alexander King, Alexander Woollcott, -- in fact most intellectuals, especially those just emerged from the egg -- &amp; even you with your "dialectical attack" &amp; "analytical affront" on the fairer &amp; pleasanter sex.
                            </p>

                                Everything above may be true &amp; we may <em>both</em> know it. "The M. knows that one too" however <em>means</em> that he can thread his way with ease &amp; assurance in <em>the most god-awful tangle</em> the ingenious mind can throw up!!

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Your whole letter, as I said, is really excellent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You get involved here &amp; there and of course you feel it &amp; you say, very naturally, "What the hell!!" But here are cases where you <em>try to go further</em> as in (a) above &amp; investigate <em>my</em> technique:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (b) "I presume anything I might say would be superfluous. So I keep my words to a minimum."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <em>second</em> sentence is very true &amp; honest. Often people say "I can find nothing to say to you." They then go to someone else and deliver themselves of 25,000 assorted words on the same subject!! Literary men say often "I have no ideas and stare at a blank page." Wow! Again they <em>have</em> millions (&amp; can "breed" more at that --- ), but they are NOT <em>satisfied</em> with what they have, so they clam up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus you put your finger on it "<em>I</em> KEEP MY WORDS --- " etc. But "I" is at the moment <em>my enemy</em>, the enemy of Alfred Robert Pulyan! So I say -- do <em>not</em> do so. So talk! <em>Orders!</em> <span class="checkmark">&#10003;</span>

                                You say, "But I don't wanna talk." That is your disagreeable task &amp; you have my sympathy! UB-GUB doesn't help!

                                Your first sentence "I PRESUME ---" shows the first wound to ego. It hurts. He retreats. That is all. But such a "light affliction" can "win so great a prize" (Christianity has all the words somewhere!). <sup>[1]</sup>

                                "<em>Yoga</em>" -- if we "<em>decide</em>" to meditate we have one strike against us! Besides it is <em>a do-it-yourself technique</em>. Those are only for <em>heroes</em>. <em>How</em> to decide not to decide? Wu-wei. Hatha-Yoga seeks to "control." You control more than you can handle (in the body) already. You need to "decontrol."

                                "<em>We cannot follow science &amp; intuition</em>." Intuition <em>is</em> the method of science -- I feel you regard "intuition" as a higher faculty than it is, it is only <em>short-cut thinking</em> &amp; does not include ESP &amp; other methods, or alleged methods, of direct knowledge. In other words if "intuition" represents your advance upon "intellection" it is a trifling one and in the same field.

                                In many of your letters you voice the curious fear that you might become a "nothing." The fact is that you are NOW a "nothing," but you can be a "something." Another metaphor is the top of a submerged iceberg (7/8 under water) -- &amp; I do <em>not</em> mean the "subconscious."

                                You can <em>have</em> "attachment" &amp; anything else you like <em>after</em> you have done what is needful. I am not suggesting your way of life -- only the way to being <em>able</em> to "live." The "cast" is while the broken leg heals, not the normal way of living. I am not prescribing <em>WAYS OF LIFE</em>, I am trying to work a change-over <em>experience</em>. <em>You confuse means with ends</em>! The scaffolding is not the skyscraper. Questions about what you are &amp; where you go <em>have no place</em> in the "work" we are doing, which is to free you to judge &amp; act (or at least to know whether it <em>is</em> "you" or what it is).

                                Jesus &amp; Gautama &amp; others elaborated a philosophy from their understanding. So have I. So could you. But to use it to <em>get</em> the understanding is ridiculous. Hence the folly -- <em>utter</em> folly -- of reading books on philosophy etc. (And that cuts out thousands of enticing old &amp; new issues.)
