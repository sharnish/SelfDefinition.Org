He is <em>a long way further on</em> than you &amp; that I think is <em>a reasonable inference</em> (from lectures, books, acquaintance etc.). My remark <em>should not have been made</em>.

If I were "unawakened" &amp; had the offer you had from some person claiming awakening I would be careful <em>not to lose him completely</em> because if I was <em>wrong</em> I should have thrown away all that life has to offer &amp; if I was <em>right</em> I should have merely prevented some extra trouble for myself, writing, attending sessions or what not (where I could have acquired something anyway).

                                Sorry I forgot this one &amp; it is a lulu. "Let me ask you for the reasons for your interest in other people --- is this some sort of law which must be followed, or do you expect further help for helping others?"

                            <p>
                                Thus they always look for an ego-motive, "what's in it for me?" etc. &amp; this they regard as a TRUISM!

                            <p>
                                It reminds me of the science-fiction story where a man visited a planet where "utility" ruled -- he observed their plain vases &amp; cups &amp; so on &amp; one day painted a <em>pattern</em> on one!

                                Consternation! Whatever was the UTILITY of this? (they could not understand any other reason for such an action, or any action).

                                To be "outgoing," friendly <em>for its own sake</em> is regarded on this third planet (Earth) as prime aberration!! (or fishy).

                                But this is <em>false as a reason</em> because NOBODY takes money or its equivalent for this work unless in actual need &amp; then only as between friends who SHARE ALL THEY HAVE. Don't be alarmed! (I do not refer to all the fanciful organizations.)

                                (B) On another plane consider that we are disguised modes of the One <span class="nowrap">Self-Consciousness &amp;</span> although separated into so many of us it strives to realize itself in each of us &amp; to unite again. This is crudely stated I know, but not so far from the truth.

                                (C) Psychologically consider that as we descend into deeper &amp; deeper depths of psychosis we tend to become more &amp; more concentrated on self to the exclusion of others, even in the minutest details.

                                Instead of being "open" we become "withdrawn." Thus <em>sanity</em> demands the attitude that so puzzles you.

                                Your motto is "Stop giving me facts, they confuse me. I refer to the "angelic Doctor", query No. 3, also to query No. 2. As far as our "work", friendship is not a state you can ARGUE yourself into. It happens or it doesn't and there you are.
