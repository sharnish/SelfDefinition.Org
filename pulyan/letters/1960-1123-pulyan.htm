								Dear Richard,
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<!-- OMIT QUESTION MARK <span style="font-size: 130%;"><em>&nbsp;?&nbsp;</em></span> -->
							</div>
							<p>
								<!--[Margin note: A question mark]-->
								Your question is eminently "reasonable"! What is to be done if you meet a Zen Master (says the koan)? Shall you talk to him, ignore him or sock him on the chin?
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>ANOTHER ATTITUDE</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								Sometimes a student will say: "I give in. I am through trying to argue. I am at your disposal."
							</p>
							<p>
								What do we do then? Contact God &amp; have him send a wheelbarrow to collect the student?
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>STUDENT HAS TO DO IT HIMSELF</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								Alas! Even the saints of old wrestled with themselves for years in the desert, as did Gautama the "Buddha." But the student wants supreme satisfaction, supreme enlightenment, health, the equivalent of a $5000 psychologist etc. --- all for a casual grudging word and a "might as well, it don't cost nothing" attitude -----------
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>YOUR ATTITUDE</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								This however is <em>not yet your position</em>. You are <em>demonstrating</em> to me graphically that one cannot "decide or decide not to decide" or "write without demonstrating conceit or a pretense at reason."
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>CONVINCED</em>?
							</div>
							<p>
								That is -- you are <em>not</em> saying: I am convinced that there is something to attain. How do we attain it?
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>NO</em>!
							</div>
							<p>
								Oh no! <em>You are just making a point</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you were "convinced" there would be MUCH to say -- in particular <em>how you had changed</em> from the letters before when you had all your intellectual spines up like a porcupine &amp; your dichotomizing "reason" all agog to tear everything in half ----- Then we could go on from there.
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>I'LL SHOW HIM!</em>!
							</div>
							<p>
								But your letter is merely a device in the arguments you put up (valid or not it doesn't matter) in the <em>pushing away of something you don't especially want</em>. Better bring on the dancing girls to stir your jaded appetite, it won't be until years start coming alarmingly quickly, perhaps, that you will awake from your leaden lethargy.
							</p>
							<!-- start page 2 of letter, sheet numbered 79 -->
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								THEN WE ARE <em>"AT HOME"</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								This is not "blame" of course. No ethics are involved here. If for some reason the time is not ripe (&amp; I do not know all the conditions that make one agog for "awakening") then there are satisfactions in life to be had, "unnumbered ways of dream" as the poet says. <sup>[1]</sup>
								<!-- George Russell aka "A.E." poem: "Immortality" -->
								<!-- http://www.bartleby.com/253/36.html -->
							</p>
							<div class="fnote">
								<p>
									[1. "Immortality", by A. E.
								</p>
								<p>
									WE MUST pass like smoke or live within the spirit's fire;<br />
									For we can no more than smoke unto the flame return<br />
									If our thought has changed to dream, our will unto desire,<br />
									As smoke we vanish though the fire may burn.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lights of infinite pity star the grey dusk of our days:<br />
									Surely here is soul: with it we have eternal breath:<br />
									In the fire of love we live, or pass by many ways,<br />
									By unnumbered ways of dream to death.]
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								HALF AN HOUR A DAY? <em>NOT THAT</em>!
							</div>
							<p>
								And after all how much in any day are most persons <em>actually</em> even "conscious"? Only when it becomes necessary to make a decision! Thus a person could be fully aware &amp; awake from 8 - 8.03 am, 12 - 12.05 pm, 7 - 7.05 pm etc. --- &amp; could wear a sign "open for business as follows: ----"
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>A TEST</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								Ouspensky says you could be walking down the street &amp; could say to yourself: "I must remember myself." Then you would go on: "I know I see a taxi passing. I know a man &amp; a woman are going by. I see the building across the street. I know ----" and all of a sudden it is <em>three hours later</em> &amp; you say: "My goodness. I forgot to remember myself!"
							</p>
							<p>
								We are prisoners of our day-dreaming. And so life goes by -------
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>NOTE HOWEVER</em>
								<img src="images/right-arrow.png" alt="arrow pointing to text" style="width: 30px" />
							</div>
							<p>
								<!--[<em>NOTE HOWEVER</em> - followed by an arrow pointing to this sentence]-->
								(But you will realize this is NOT the "awakening" <em>I</em> refer to. <em>That is not voluntary</em> -- even though one "works" toward it.)
							</p>
							<p>
								I was merely sketching a way of life, the usual one.
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>BOOK</em><br />
								<span class="note">(HE TRIES TO AVOID "INTELLECTUALIZING" AND THEN FLOPS RIGHT INTO IT!) BUT GET IT.</span>
							</div>
							<p>
								There is a Mentor book "The Teachings of the Mystics" by Walter T. Stace (MD306, .50) [published 1960] <sup>[2]</sup> and although he is only a philosopher, &amp; mixes up "mystical experiences" with "awakening," nevertheless it might help to establish the <em>mere existence</em> of that which I speak &amp; which I claim to know myself &amp; to have assisted others to.

							<div class="left-margin-note">
								BACK TO THE <em>PROBLEM</em> ...
							</div>
							<p>
								<!--[<em>BACK TO THE PROBLEM</em> ... ]-->
								I find it <em>quite possible</em> to write "awakened" friends! It is perhaps necessary to be genuinely "open" &amp; not snide or tricky, but to be just naturally friendly. There is no reason to avoid "reason" especially when it is keen "discrimination."
							</p>
							<div class="left-margin-note">
								<em>ONE OCCASION ONLY!</em>
							</div>
							<p>
								As for "egotism" &amp; "conceit" those are our birthrights -- yours &amp; mine, but ONCE, just ONCE and "really truly" <em>they must be shed</em>. <em>After that</em> you can <em>resume</em> -- but it won't be quite the same!
