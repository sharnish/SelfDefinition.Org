                                Dear Richard,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is necessary to establish <em>some</em> communication between us, even if I have to wave a rattle to do it. So come out from that corner &amp; don't look at me that way! ("Joke" please note. I refer to our treatment of psychotics, humorously.) But one must have <em>something in common</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I suppose the only thing is to look at the positive statements you make &amp; see what you <em>DO</em> say.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SO! : --
                            </p>
                            <div class="left-margin-note">
                                <em>ADVICE</em>!!
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                (1) <em>"It is up to you to validate 'certain claims' or try another tack."</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (a) "up to you"&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a child saying "up to you mother to do this or that, because you love me, or I shall throw myself in the river." Actually you speak as though I wished to gain converts to a movement! There is no "movement"!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It <em>is</em> desirable that you should "validate" me, &amp; actually essentially part of the process, but I can force nothing &amp; directly prove nothing. Could Gautama or Jesus? No -- only words. Their disciples had to invent a crop of "miracles" which <em>actually help not at all in our quest</em> &amp; Gautama &amp; Jesus protested several times. Cf. Gautama's story of the ferryman &amp; the monk who could walk on the water.
                            </p>
                            <div class="left-margin-note">
                                THERE IS NO MIRACLE HOWEVER SPECTACULAR TO CHANGE YOU. EVEN <em>GOD</em> CANNOT DO IT! <em>(OBVIOUSLY)</em>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                (b) "try another tack"&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the "technique" is not your affair. You are not <em>that</em> objective yet!! The usual agreement is that the student agrees to continue <em>whatever</em> happens, or is said, &amp; the Zen monk is kept waiting a day or so before he even gets through the gate. Your ego is RIDING HIGH still, &amp; that just won't do, because it is the reverse of our objective.
                            </p>
                            <div class="left-margin-note">
                                YOU MUST GIVE ME THE REINS. I AM NOT FORCING ANYTHING -- MERELY BEING <em>AVAILABLE</em>.

                            <p>
                                (2) <em>"I am interested in knowing the truth"</em>
                            </p>
                            <div class="left-margin-note">
                                MILDLY <em>INTERESTED</em>?</div>
                            <p>
                                There is <em>only one way</em> &amp; that is to quit the egocentric position. This is <em>rough</em> &amp; needs a catalyst, a friend, an outside fulcrum. One must first "decide not to decide" which is IMPOSSIBLE -- SO one has to <em>have help in dropping "decision" itself --- once ---</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>No</em> push-button methods exist. Jesus you remember looked sadly at one young man, God will not come for you with a wheelbarrow! So face it! Either you get nowhere while you live or you do it the hard way. No "royal" road!!!!! (made easy for kings &amp; R). So I ask HOW MUCH INTERESTED? Enough to do violence to pretty little ego? Do you want it as much as "air"?

                                Well! There are <em>no degrees of attainment</em>, no more or less. It is first a way of technique &amp; discipline &amp; then, BOOM! -- a discontinuity, an abyss -- the mosquito bites the iron ball, the impossible just naturally happens &amp; life is normal -- Your life now is absurd. But the brainwashed doesn't know it -- or shall we say the unfortunate victim of a post-hypnotic suggestion? (These are merely vague illustrations -- call off your dichotomizing dogs!) As for "seeking for seeking's sake" that is really ODD! Paradox! Better <em>imagine</em> a $100 bill in your apartment &amp; seek for it all your life. Then there is <em>little danger</em> of finding it !!

                                When I "sought" I said <em>by God I hope I get it</em>, not I shall have fun in the frustrating process. "Knock &amp; it shall be opened unto you." "<em>No. No. No.</em>" "What is the trouble?" "Alfred," -- this is R speaking -- "<em>there is ONE THING TO DO</em>." "What?" "<em>SCREW UP THE DOOR</em>."

                                God is to be sure the essence not only of our quest, but <em>is</em> our quest itself &amp; our "work" as we do it.

                                But I am <em>not</em> "trying" to "do" something. I am <em>doing</em> it &amp; need no help in technique. You will give all the help you are capable of <em>anyway.</em> <em>It may be enough. It may not be.</em> But if I had an instrument in my consciousness, I should at all times know at what point the needle pointed.

                                Thus it might even regress a little at times but there is usually progress, although the student EXHAUSTS HIS REPERTOIRE of advice, cooperation, disagreement, frustration, suggestions, analysis, summing-up, comparison, reason, etc. etc.

                                (1) <em>Paranoia</em> of course stems merely from the <em>boss</em> conception that ego has of himself. Blown up as big as an ox he will fancy that he can alter the world, govern nations, order everybody about.

                                So the humble "awakened" person is accused of paranoia but he only issues orders "on request" &amp; "by agreement" <em>when a student asks him to do so for a purpose.</em> He does NOT reform the world or seek power. He is no Richelieu, "eminence grise" or power behind the throne -- just lives inconspicuously &amp; usually dies the same way (unless his disciples BLOW HIM UP!!)
