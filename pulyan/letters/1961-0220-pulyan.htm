                                To "<em>toy with evasiveness</em>" implies a degree of conscious deception. Now this might be some technique of "working" &amp; so I might be entitled to it in view of the greater good. However I have <em>not</em> done any such thing &amp; the trouble lies in the fact that there is indeed <em>no way whatever</em> of "conveying" the experience.

                                Because anything "explainable" would be liable to counterattack in WORDS &amp; fortunately this <em class="double">is</em> "experience" (as real as a <em>color</em> or <span class="nobreak"><em>sound</em>)</span> &amp; so standing on its own feet &amp; not verbalizable.

                                A mighty conscious creative entity as subtle and all pervasive as electricity, but possessed of every capacity men's souls and minds possessed: an entity which manifested itself through all forms of life. If so why? To what end?

                                Is it happiness or a bitter-sweet joy? What words can we choose? (The bitterness of maturity, the sweetness of a child.) Words refer to things we have known. Here is something comparable to an animal becoming a man -- what words for such a change?

                                "Animal becoming a man" say R. "How wild can your comparisons get?" Let us see.

                                Experiments have shown that to a certain age animals outstrip human children. But <em>children develop self-consciousness</em> &amp; that is an overwhelming change. Do they learn this; study to do this?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No. Not formally, anyway. But they <em>learn a language</em> &amp; that is a powerful weapon, fashioned by self-conscious people, full of such concepts -- even the words "self-conscious" .... Further they <em>observe &amp; copy</em> available adults .... One day the world is seen with new eyes &amp; the child may think it has a unique faculty. This is soon corrected by experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It would seem to be easier to take the next step, to <em class="double">S</em>elf <em class="double">C</em>onsciousness. We have a language skill, we have some feeling of "Self." It is true that <em>until it occurs to us we can not know it</em>. But it was the same with self-consciousness, &amp; besides there are a number of people who assure us it happened to them and that it is an "experience" or rather a sudden change in consciousness (like "seeing a joke" perhaps).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But we jib. We say it is a false analogy, there is no such thing, it does not happen. But we cover ourselves by adding, "if something happens it means nothing and is of no importance."

                                Our friends who are "awakened" say, "since you have little to lose except a few minutes now &amp; then, &amp; everything to gain -- truly 'Everything' -- then isn't it a good gamble?"

                                But we really <em>fear</em> to go on with this &amp; so we just go on arguing. First we say, what are the techniques? Well in a way the same as for "self-consciousness" i.e. using the language &amp; observation of the guru (who is "adult" compared with you). But there is obviously more than that. We must exceed the "self"-concept, <em>not remove it</em> because it is the essence of a human-being, but we must surrender it so that the <em class="double">S</em>elf can come in. This we cannot usually do by ourselves.

                                The guru is willing to give all his time &amp; best efforts to help the student without hope of reward or even thanks. He expects every kind of ingratitude, slippery business, ... and gray hairs. He expects the student to argue, argue indefinitely even though that produces no experiences. He finds the student wants to direct the procedure to some extent, to know all the methods, what is being done &amp; so forth (even if it makes it impossible to help him to realization!). He finds the student is just an "Indian-receiver" criticizing everything in great detail &amp; wanting everything done as comfortably as possible until finally his guru gently takes him in a plush-lined wheelbarrow &amp; dumps him in the Seventh Heaven, which he goggles at with a furred tongue and a lackadaisical eye ... Or perhaps he has a push-button mechanism installed ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After all, with so many advertisers &amp; sects competing for him, should he not get a bit choosy?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The guru is sympathetic &amp; not sadistic by nature, indeed he knows what is going on (&amp; alas -- what will go on) &amp; so he does his best. <em>But the One stays away ...</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can fool the guru (perhaps), bully the guru, placate the guru, bamboozle him ... but apparently not the One Self. Oh well, very annoying, try again ... ("How does the One penetrate my insincerity?" Not too difficult is it?)

                                "I will not overlook with haste anyone who claims <em>to be able to attain</em> this knowledge." That's white of you, pardner. (But oh <em>what a temptation</em> to say the obvious.)<br />

                                P.S. Sometimes the student plays a game like those geniuses who cannot look after themselves. So for the sake of their genius a bunch of people (maybe several women) must feed them, clothe them, console them, get them out of scrapes, look after their health, &amp; so on in face of all discouragements &amp; even in face of blank ignorant ingratitude. So the student says I disbelieve you and everything but it is your job to save me. Go ahead! But there is a catch in this -- something the student doesn't realize.
