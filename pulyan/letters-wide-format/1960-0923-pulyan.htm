						<em>Personality of the Master (the catalyst)</em>
					</h3>
					<p>
						I “worked” with a Taoist in the succession of classical Taoism -- a rare person
						indeed. However for a man like myself, <em>terribly</em> ego-entangled, like
						you a smart aleck, this method was too mild. I encountered a lady who had been working
						as a therapist. I gradually came to think she was far superior <em>for me</em> to
						the other person. So I switched (feeling remorseful about the Taoist!) (-- but now
						my friend.)
					</p>
					<p>
						This “exercising of judgment” was an ego thing perhaps, but it was justified by
						the event.
					</p>
					<p>
						I wish to emphasize that throughout my “work” with both of these people I had no
						<em>proof</em> that they had any, shall we say, transcendental enlightenment.
						I conjectured it, BUT EVEN THEN it was only words &amp; imagination, because of
						course I did not KNOW what it was, not having had it myself.

						<em>ZEN</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Zen Masters I know are enlightened &amp; “guaranteed” by the Master that “taught”
						them (wrong word -- but let us not boggle here). This “guarantee” goes back in a
						chain (uninterrupted we <em>assume</em>) to the Buddha Gautama &amp; I have enough
						details in my library to trace any Zen Master all the way back to Hui-neng &amp;
						Bodhidharma &amp; thence to Gautama himself. But WHO guarantees Gautama?
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -10em; top: 1em;text-align:center;">
						IN
						<br />
						<em>CHRISTIANITY</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						There is <em>NO Christian chain</em> like this. “Ordination” does not confer
						<em>experience</em>. Only sacrifice does that -- and an awakened Master. Only rare
						persons have done it alone (&amp; even then we do not know all the contributing
						&amp; formative influences). It <em>could</em> happen under the tortures of the
						Gestapo, but that is rough, dreadfully so. Jesus said “my yoke is easy.” Well “devotion
						to God” seems the easiest way &amp; the pleasantest. It would <em>not</em> have
						done it for me, &amp; I think <em>not</em> for you, sonny boy. But Jesus was
						an accomplished therapist and it appears even through the weird theological trappings
						of the NT. Mark (John Marcus) was a shrewd individual &amp; I suppose was about
						50 when he wrote, remembering his boyhood experiences &amp; what Peter said &amp;
						Paul (&amp; his friends like Luke &amp; relatives like Barnabus). While he wrote
						Jerusalem was being destroyed by the Romans &amp; Jesus told them that would happen
						if they (the Jews) continued to revolt. Individual Christians like Eckhart <em>have</em>
						&nbsp;become enlightened &amp; then they had to “play it cozy” or get burnt alive.
						Nevertheless people asked Jesus continually for a SIGN, and the “Gospels” (John
						never used the word) contain many “miracles” which are supposed to guarantee enlightenment.
						THEY DO NOT. Jesus himself warned against this.

						<br />
						<em>SUBUD</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						“Bapak” Subuh became enlightened in 1933 and without forcing it he has become world-known
						in “Subud.” (It is only a coincidence that the name “Subud” resembles his own: “Subuh.”)
						This method uses physical decontrol, physical surrender, FIRST. It works, although
						I have not <em>personally</em> met one person enlightened this way. “We” (my teacher
						&amp; I) use some physical methods where necessary. Especially with middle-aged
						&amp; older persons bodily tensions may be <em>obstacles</em> to “work” &amp; may
						be holding mental blockages. Thus it may
						<!-- -->
						<!-- start page 31 of scans -->
						<!-- start page 4 of letter -->
						<!-- this letter has 3 pages of apendices: 30, 31, 32, 33 -->
						<!-- -->
						be necessary to supplement psychotherapy by <em>a new kind</em> of physiotherapy
						(not merely the current meaning of that word which refers to exercising muscles,
						the use of prosthetic devices, &amp; so on). Rather “de-control.” (Note Hatha Yoga
						makes the prime mistake of “controlling.” Better let the body do its work! The “voluntary”
						muscles etc. cause <em>all</em> your troubles, because friend ego is handling them
						&amp; “channelling” them -- is that spelled correctly? See F.M. Alexander’s work
						in England &amp; many others.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Later I grew to understand my own teacher &amp; to apply the Tibetan word “rinpoche,”
						honored or revered. She was not in a “chain,” had no teacher. So my “guarantee”
						goes back to her “guarantee.” Thus there is always one NOT guaranteed.

						<em>TAOISM</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Lao Tse was asked for credentials. He said “by the Tao.” What else is there to say?
					</p>

					<div class="rightoffset" style="top:-0.7em;text-align:center;left: 32em;">
						(Lucky to <em>have</em> a choice!)
					</div><!-- default is left:44em -->

					<p>
						Thus <em>a delicate discrimination</em> is required in choosing a master, “discrimination”
						= “viveka” (Sanskrit) <span style="font-size: 110%">वि वे क</span>
						<!-- source http://shabdkosh.raftaar.in/Meaning-of-%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%95-in-English -->
						and implies “weighing the imponderables”! This you must nevertheless do. Almost
						a leap in the dark. Faith that proof will come! <em>A paradox however you look at it.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Since masters are one in a million, and <em>by correspondence</em> one in who knows
						what, where can you turn? Either to Subud or to the Zen Master in New York (Muira
						Roshi). These however require <em>personal</em> attendance &amp; even then may NOT
						be for you. A slim chance indeed! 1 in 3,000,000,000! Doubt exceedingly if <em>any</em>
						advertised course is worth anything except as a mild psychotherapy or literary sedative,
						if that.
					</p>
					<p>
						The student hardly ever thinks that the Master knows intimately, and as a friend,
						that which is responsible for the trees, the earth, the nebulas, not to mention
						ourselves! Even if the student regards this as hypothetical he should at least imagine
						it is how the Master sees it -- and that therefore a minute squabbling about fancied
						slights and so forth is out of place in this larger context, &amp; more suitable
						for children &amp; the highly superficial &amp; moronic. The student should in fact
						have some of the elements of greatness and fine thinking, otherwise the “work” is
						as vain, as the French say, as washing the head of a donkey. The Master must be
						very patient because the student <em>assumes</em> that he will ‘stand by’ while
						the student questions, probes &amp; examines -- &amp; often to excess or flippantly.
						The student by his very experimenting is showing that he does not know whether the
						Master is one or not! So he should at least make sure that his quarry doesn’t get
						away while he ‘draws a bead’ on it!! Fortunately the M. knows this only too well.

						Sokatsu Shaku on his seventieth birthday (Apr 16, 1939) recounted to Sokei-An that
						in the 40 (!!) years of his teaching, 3,000 men &amp; women had come to study Zen
						under his direction. Of these he initiated 900 (presumably the rest were inaccessible)
						&amp; of these 13 completed the training, but only <em>4</em> of these had
						“penetrated to the core of Zen” &amp; became teachers. They were Soseki Goto, Eisan
						Tatsuta, Chikudo Ohasama &amp; Sokei-An himself. I worked, as I said, under a pupil
						of Ohasama (and friend of Sokei-An) but changed, as I said. Zen is tough indeed.<sup>3</sup>

							Pulyan is quoting a writing by Sokei-an:
						</p>
						<p>
							"On April 16, 1939, we celebrated the seventieth birthday of Sokatsu Shaku. On that
							day he recounted to us the history of Ryomo-an, relating many of the experiences
							of his half-century of Zen life. He told us that during the forty years of his teaching
							three thousand men and women had come to study Zen under his direction. Of these
							he had initiated nine hundred into Zen. Thirteen of the nine hundred had completed
							the training, but of these thirteen only four had really penetrated to the core
							of Zen. These four he had ordained as teachers.
						</p>
						<p>
							"The eldest of the four is Zuigan Goto, known at Ryomo-an as Soseki Goto. He was
							originally a Zen monk of the Myoshin-ji school. I have already spoken of him. The
							second is Eisan Tatsuta, who is ten years my junior. He is a graduate of the Department
							of Zoology in the Imperial University of Tokyo and a professor of Zoology. The third,
							Chikudo Ohasama. graduated from the Deparrment of Ethics in the Imperial University
							of Tokyo and completed his studies at Heidelberg. His <i>Der Lebendige Buddhismus</i>
							in Japan is a partial translation of the famous Zen text, <i>Hekiganroku.</i> The fourth
							is myself."

						“Personality” is, again, a dangerous thing for us to estimate people by. A priest
						may appear to us to have “elevation” &amp; to be a

						fine &amp; dedicated man, but there are many such &amp; they rarely, very rarely,
						help towards enlightenment. I declined the title of “Venerable” in the Buddhist
						church (of Soto Zen), because such things are <em>devices</em> &amp; do not suit
						me. I belong to no organization.
					</p>
					<p>
						My ‘master’ could as well have been a bum who found enlightenment under the stars
						while hitchhiking a ride on an open freight-car or a man who robbed a bank. <em>In no
							way</em> do I teach “ethics,” although “freedom” curiously enough leads to conduct
						that seems highly satisfactory in general &amp; never to “meanness.” Thus there
						are NO criteria &amp; one can <em>easily</em> as Shakespeare said be “deceived by
						ornament” (and by “elevation”). Authors get “accepted” this way, &amp; also “princes”
						of the Church, the Pope, Bishops, great scientists &amp; psychologists, philanthropists,
						millionaires (!!), political figures ---- “famous” persons. Pass them by for this
						is Dead Sea fruit -- but the dog of the mind “investigates” every lamp-post -- and
						in plainer English how hard it is to reject the thousands of fascinating paper-backs
						&amp; other publications. Yet I might ask you not to read <em>anything</em> of the
						sort (unless prescribed). Certainly you can have only <em>one</em> Master at a time.
						This is not a case of picking up a trifle here &amp; a trifle there. That you have
						done so far. It seems I am drifting from the Master to the Student so let us do
						so officially under the caption:

						<em>“Ego</em><sub>1</sub> <em>and Ego</em><sub>2</sub>”<em> (Devices to preserve Egocentricity)</em>
					</h3>
					<p>
						We do not pull flowers up to see how they are growing, but Ego (Self!) cannot endure
						being out of the driver’s seat and so even in the “work” he tries to be both objective
						&amp; subjective. To be specific Ego<sub>1 </sub>wants to watch the progress of
						the work with an occasional criticism or pat on the back for the M.
					</p>
					<p>
						“How shall we handle Ego<sub>2</sub>?” is asked by Ego<sub>1</sub>. Or -- “I don’t
						think I (who is “I”? -- why, Ego<sub>1</sub>) would have handled me (Ego<sub>2</sub>
						!!) quite that way.” Or: “Fine,” says Ego<sub>1</sub>, “that’s showing him (Ego<sub>2</sub>).”
					</p>
					<p>
						This schizoidal device <em>preserves</em> Ego<sub>1</sub> at the expense of a <em>fictitious</em>
						&nbsp; Ego<sub>2</sub> !! You have already started this process.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sometimes Ego<sub>1</sub> will say he is “seeking” &amp; does not DESIRE TO FIND.
						What is this? A pleasure merely in the action of the reason? Apparently. In any
						case Ego<sub>2</sub> is <em>not even necessary here</em>. Ego is asserting the utmost
						“doubt even of doubt” &amp; refusal to go even as far as the word “the” without
						definition. It is a sound &amp; invulnerable position. So is advanced psychosis,
						but that seems more restful -- at times! Such a position (like solipsism) is fine
						when one is healthy, happy, young &amp; immortal. It gets an awful kick later.
					</p>

					<div class="rightoffset" style="top:-2rem;">
						Solipsism: <br />
						The view or theory that the self is all that can be known to exist.
					</div>
					<p>
						Ego<sub>1</sub>, for all that, sometimes feels that his constant observation of
						Ego<sub>2</sub> (“self-consciousness”) is unsatisfactory. He may feel
						<!-- -->
						<!-- start page 33 of scans -->
						<!-- start page 6 of letter (last) -->
						<!-- this letter has 3 pages of apendices: 30, 31, 32, 33 -->
						<!-- -->
						that his division is a faked device. In love he may for a time forget himself (which
						means -- become <em>spontaneous</em>) &amp; the experience is delightful, unaccustomed
						&amp; turns out often to be most unwise. It occurs often when young &amp; when judgment
						would be desirable (for a change!), especially if the girl is not so spontaneous!
						If they both are it is wonderful, but again the <em>claims of the everyday</em>
						come in, &amp; the magic fades away. Everything in Japan used to be a “way.” There
						was a “way” of sword-play, of wrestling, of flower arrangement, of drinking tea,
						of commerce even, of drawing &amp; painting -- and the characteristic of each was
						<em>spontaneity</em>. Even archery (incredible results even in semi-darkness, splitting
						one arrow with another) -- &amp; such spontaneity daunts us. We are system-minded.
						Zen may seem to be a “system” of mass-production, but the essence of the work is
						individual. I have no “system” whatever for the same reason -- no two people are
						alike. Certainly egocentricity is always the devil to be conquered, but from that
						central point he (ego or self) diverges in innumerable ways &amp; uses every imaginable
						device, some very snide, others really subtle. He may know it too -- and still throw
						up a smoke-screen! He resists the means to release -- to the point of murder even
						(fortunately, since he is free to withdraw at any time, he usually withdraws under
						a confusion of self-justification. But if he <em>were</em> trapped -- as I was --
						oh boy!!! In the Reichian technique for example the room is often a shambles).
					</p>
					<p>
						So we DO “protect” something. And how! What? Ego? Oh no -- <em>while we live</em>
						we are of course “we” &amp; always that remains -- but the “boss conception,” the
						“ultimate decider,” the “second line of defense,” these he INSISTS on at all costs.
						So Jung &amp; others know the truth but sit in the audience (behind their desk for
						example) and are never part of the play. It is ludicrous to think I could help Jung
						-- he is heavily armed. I <em>could</em> get ONE letter from almost everybody by
						<em>promising “a new technique</em>” but to get <em>involved</em> in it. Oh dear
						no! Most certainly not! Utterly fantastic! -- who knows what --- Thus Jesus was
						correct. It is the treasure of the humble &amp; for this goodly pearl a merchant
						sold <em>all he had</em> &nbsp; -- and <em>bought it</em>. I can persuade <em>almost
							anybody</em> to say “O.K. Go ahead! What do I have to lose?” <em>It is a Pyrrhic victory</em>,
						it is unreal. In that way one sells toothpaste. They must come to me and <em>really</em>
						want it. Since they can <em>easily</em> push God away how can I succeed where God
						does not? This is not a mystery I can solve. But the truly accessible, as Jesus
						said, are FEW. Up to you -- And so many words!
