                        Dear Dick,
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="width: 20rem; top: 0.5rem; left: -7rem;">
                        <em>LONG DISCOURSE<br />
                            ON “ANALYSIS”</em>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Yes, I suppose I must be careful in any reference to “psychotherapy.” There is a
                        book recently published called the “Frog Pond,” I believe, that gives a lady’s experiences
                        with 6 psychoanalysts. One she calls “Silent Simon” &amp; he used to listen &amp;
                        say nothing at all, but take notes. On Thursday he saw a friend who told him what
                        to say on Friday!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think your observations are very sound &amp;, as you say, the “normal” doesn’t
                        mean much. You never <em>remove</em> your “aberrations” but you <em>do</em> learn
                        to live with them or to supersede them, “go above them.” After three years and $5,000
                        there ought to be <em>some</em> results! But often it goes on indefinitely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further the analyst <em>may</em> be pretty aberrated &amp; bad-tempered himself
                        and a very confused man. They vary of course &amp; there might be a rare one or
                        two (as in the “Frog Pond,” the last two analysts) who has a gift for the job &amp;
                        who makes an art of it. However there are few of them &amp; <em>millions</em> of
                        people in mental trouble.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing everybody needs is “love” (in the correct sense -- <em>outgoing</em> friendship,
                        asking nothing except to help) &amp; doctors call it TLC (tender, loving care).
                        Many women would therefore be <em>far more capable</em> of helping the mentally
                        troubled but in our society men predominate in most professions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I regard the method of digging up item by item from the unconscious or subconscious
                        remunerative ($$$) for the analyst but a long, long way round -- the “analytical”
                        instead of the “synthetical.” Let me explain.

                        I had a friend who was forced to study singing by his mother and he did not like
                        it as a child. In retrospect my friend could always ‘bring up’ from the past a flood
                        of tears &amp; no doubt <em>could do this for ever</em>. This was not the way to
                        help him. However merely by speaking very frankly &amp; naturally to him as a friend
                        he snapped right out of it &amp; today is a highly successful man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <em>Freudian</em> analysts have just <em>a few</em> standard “complexes” (incestual
                        love for mother, hatred of father, fear of castration etc.) which everybody is supposed
                        to be deeply affected by. The patient always “brings up” this material (not without
                        help &amp; ‘direction’ I am sure!!!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the <em>Jungians</em> have their own standard set of “archetypes” -- and
                        these too the student or patient faithfully “brings up” (with a little help I think!!!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have seen <em>the same person</em> do this with a Freudian &amp; Jungian analyst
                        respectively. It is a joke.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No doubt the Adlerians would find the “inferiority complex” as the real source of
                        trouble.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If then I advise the “synthetical” what do I mean? Well, the truth is I only chose
                        that word as a <em>contrast</em> to “analytic,” but what I <em>do</em> mean is <em>some
                            overall method</em> that does not need this searching for infinite detail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actually it is found in the course of “work” for awakening that the student becomes
                        what is <em>called</em> “normal” (socially acceptable?) in a very short time. It
                        is even true that it is easier for a very aberrated (or <em>slightly</em> psychotic)
                        person to jump to “awakening” (which is severe sanity) much faster than a so-called
                        “normal” person who is full of “controls.” Why is this?
                        <!-- -->

                        It is because <em>awakening-therapy is directed CONTRA EGO</em>. That is not to
                        <em>remove</em> ego, which is absurd poppycock since consciousness includes self-consciousness
                        &amp; unless you kill someone or make them unconscious “ego” or “self” is still
                        there. <em class="double">It is “us” while we live of course</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless there is a disease of ego and it is the idea that <em class="double">we</em>
                        are the final authority! It is a surprising thing. We are born into a wonderful
                        but puzzling world. We <em>never</em> solve the problems of what we are &amp; where
                        we are nor why we are, but we keep going from one “solution” to another (hopefully!)
                        &amp; always with the idea that we are the judge, the decider, the Supreme Court,
                        the Court of Last Resort. It takes <em>smashing blows</em> of adversity, death,
                        illness, unhappiness to undermine our cockiness &amp; even from the fire there is
                        a last feeble cry of proud self-assertion. Odd.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not for everybody. Some are born with a touch of aspiration for a deep beauty
                        &amp; understanding as shown in music, Nature, the Arts, Love, <span class="nowrap">
                            etc. --</span> which involves surrender of the smart-aleck self, throwing oneself
                        into EXPERIENCE rather than reaching it by any logical or reasoning process. These
                        people are smart because they realize naturally that <em class="double">anything</em>&nbsp;that
                        can be thought &amp; then said (or written or printed) can be controverted by other
                        thoughts &amp; words. There is NO finality in words. “Science” is a way of winning
                        difficult knowledge of <em>how</em> Nature works but of course cannot answer questions
                        like “<em>what</em>” is so &amp; so. Each discovery merely needs one more &amp;
                        so on for ever.

                        I wonder if there is <em>one</em> scientist anywhere who is so foolish as to imagine
                        that the <em>ultimate</em> nature of things &amp; ourselves will ever be reached
                        by physics &amp; psychology respectively?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a matter of fact “psychology” deals with everything BUT the nature of the mind
                        itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Facing this dilemma it is welcome news that there is a way to break through. The
                        experience so obtained is personal &amp; can be passed only to a few.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet “millions” of people follow the Buddha’s remarks &amp; call it a “religion.”
                        In the case of Christianity we call it “God.” Then people say to <span class="nowrap">
                            me -- </span>oh, your “work” is “religious,” it is to find “God.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I agree with them, <em>to avoid semantics</em>, but isn’t it obvious that THIS PUTS
                        THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The “experience” is <em>primary</em> &amp; at this stage there are NO NAMES, NO
                        DESCRIPTIONS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If some idiots want to make something (a new religion!!) out of <em>my</em> remarks
                        they can, but it will not mean a thing.

                    <p>
                        But I have drifted from psychotherapy to the question of awakening “work.” So to
                        another point.

                        The general idea as far as words go has often been “explained,” in the Oriental

                        which emphasize the one fact that we arise from (&amp; return to), the one basis
                        of the Universe.

                        The claims of life, friends, etc. “Survive” is our motto while we can. Of course
