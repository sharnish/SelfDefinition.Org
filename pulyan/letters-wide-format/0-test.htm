                        Dear Richard,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mac <sup>2</sup> is very kind, and your letter is very straightforward. As Mac may
                        have told you I am not a believer in polite phrases but feel that to save time we
                        should tell the truth as best as we can.
                    </p>
                    <div class="rightoffset" style="top: -5rem;">
                        <p>
                            <sup>2</sup><br />
                            A mutual acquaintance, who provided the Zen master’s name and address. R wrote that
                            he had spent decades searching unsuccessfully for Truth.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        You are 43, no longer young, and in a position that I found intolerable. Like you,
                        I was a “seeker,” but it is obvious no <em>words</em> will satisfy you. Otherwise
                        let us publish them in the newspapers. From this the vanity of using mind (intellect)
                        in the search is obvious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However as you say IT IS ALL WE HAVE, so at the same time as you recognize the vanity
                        of the instrument <em>you have to use it</em> to consider what A.R.P. is all
                        about (for example).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is all vague and tantalizing -- not even to know what your <em>are</em> &amp;
                        what is to become of you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider this from A.R.P.’s standpoint (if you can!). He tries to “work” only with
                        likely cases. Even then success is not 100%. He gets months (even years) of misunderstanding
                        &amp; trouble from each one of these, and more gray hairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They are not to “blame,” they are using a mind which is amazingly persnickety &amp;
                        easily slips into mere debating society argument (on every minutest point) so that
                        the wood is lost in the trees ... <em>not knowing the result aimed at</em> they
                        are not deeply dedicated (usually) and things go in one ear and out the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He cannot tell them that as far as he knows he is their only hope -- and that an
                        uncertain one -- unless they wish to go somewhere for <em>personal</em> “work”
                        (say to a Zen instructor or to Subud).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He knows something people call “God” &amp; which governs his life -- but not theirs.
                        They can be flippant about it, he can not. One day they may say “This is obvious”
                        but until then they cannot “believe” &amp; every inch of the way is a hard fight.
                    </p>

                        He <em>has</em> to be “tough” with them to remove their obstacles but <em>they</em>
                        &nbsp;interpret it as quarreling with them -- as though he would waste weary time
                        in that form of amusement!

                    <p>
                        This is written at 2:30 a.m. for example &amp; the weight of the 3,000,000,000 people
                        in the world seems at such an hour very oppressive. Further he knows that <em>not one</em>
                        of them can be trusted or treated as a real friend until after their “awakening.”
                        They are treacherous in fact <em>at some point</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wonder if Jesus had <em>one</em> friend?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The world seems stranger to me perhaps than even to you. Perhaps I could find only
                        1 out of several tens of thousands who would understand this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why not tell me as much as you can of your early upbringing and religion &amp; those
                        things you have since studied &amp; your opinion about them --- indeed ‘open up’
                        about your real sentiments.
                    </p>
