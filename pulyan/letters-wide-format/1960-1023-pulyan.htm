                        Dear Dick,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Call the object of our discussion the “One” if you like -- it has nothing to do
                        with your frenzied semantics. <em>All</em> the people you mention have only a
                        <em>fancied</em> referent &amp; <em>must be completely disregarded</em>. If they
                        are cuckoo there is no reason for you to be. I thought I <em>had</em> dealt with
                        “God”!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do <em>not</em> concentrate on the high-colored (&amp; rather delightful) <em>stylization</em>
                        of Zen. Beneath that there is <em>serious “work</em>” done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As regards “experiences” Bucke mentions many of course. That type may have differing
                        results. One person may guard it as a jealous secret all his or her life &amp; as
                        the most wonderful thing. On the other hand Sir Julian Huxley, who is a high-type
                        “humanist,” may have several such experiences and <em>regard them as purely
                                subjective</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They are not rare. They <em>are</em> “valid” (not subjective) but having one
                        does <em>not</em> enable one to <em>prove</em> their validity. Sir Julian
                        Huxley is an obvious case in point. They can come to anyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>They</em> are discussed fairly often, but there seems almost a conspiracy
                        of silence about the “understanding” <em>we</em> are dealing with in these letters
                        -- because for one thing it is quite rare -- and for another the words “an experience”
                        do not properly describe such a fundamental revelation and discovery. Have you read
                        what the <em>Upanishads</em> for example say about it? (There is a pocket-book
                        on them.)
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        I am not “<em>threatening</em> to drop your case” but rather aware that you do
                        not even show verbal desire for this thing -- and many do. Further you must believe
                        that, without any desire to press this upon you, I am actuated <em>only</em> by
                        consideration for you, because life can be rough. If there is nothing in you that
                        wants it you cannot blame me for the obvious realization that we would not get anywhere,
                        except to recrimination &amp; that is undesirable. All through the ages misguided
                        followers of “awakened” men filled with zeal have endeavored by assertions of miracles
                        &amp; marvels to boost their master’s reputation -- and actually such things are
                        beside the point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Zen says that to desire miracles is to try to put another head

                        over your own. In plain English the marvel is to be found in what we are already
                        familiar with, writing a letter or drinking a glass of water -- in the so-called
                        “commonplace.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Naturally I want your photograph -- is that such a terrible request? Did I send
                        you mine? If not I will at once do so. Or is there some special reason, as was the
                        case with a lady student of mine who was terribly disfigured in an accident?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Friendship is desirable in a study of this type because the delicate discrimination
                        required is not attainable in an atmosphere of cynical distrust, picayune carping
                        and falsetto accusations. Even a psychical researcher gets further if he approaches
                        this often murky subject in a pleasant manner. But leave this matter for the moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experiences <em>you</em> mention come unasked &amp; unexpected. They leave
                        the ego the same as before, almost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The understanding we are dealing with <em>demands</em> an *abnegation of ego,
                        even if only <em>once</em>, yet completely. This is for us humans usually a real problem.
                        For me it was nearly impossible. The friend who is assisting you (as a sort of catalyst)
                        does not have a pleasant job because ego starts a furious battle by any &amp; every
                        method, tricky, snide, violent, withdrawing &amp; so forth. (The same is true in
                        psychotherapy but it is <em>diluted</em> so that the ego doesn’t get so inflamed.
                        It is “diluted” because the “attack” on ego is slow, long drawn-out, gradual, gentle
                        -- and highly profitable!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (* You will find this exemplified in the remarks of every sage through the ages
                        -- &amp; I will instance Heraclitus, Gautama, Lao Tse --- all around <span style="white-space: nowrap;">
                            500 BC</span> when there was such an abrupt change from the (evolved) animistic
                        &amp; sacrificial cults, as dealt with by Fraser &amp; other anthropologists.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will <em>never</em> while you live find any <em>other</em> “way,” since
                        intellect alone cannot do the job &amp; only revolves in its own squirrel-cage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will <em>never</em> find a teacher-friend who will let <em>you</em> fix
                        the conditions of “work” because then you are using your ego to work on ego &amp;
                        that is self-defeating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is how it is. I cannot change it. It is an “odd” universe you &amp; I are born
                        in &amp; will die in.
