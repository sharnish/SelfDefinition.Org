                    <p>
                        You have understood me very clearly. We have given a name to our problem -- egocentricity.
                        You have this disease &amp; I see you have it. I am the doctor and have cured cases
                        before. So the thing to do is clear-cure it. And you “thank me for my efforts.”
                        And you say that prior to my last letter you “made statements” &amp; my treatment
                        consisted in saying “you are full of bologna.” (a)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You make the widest (&amp; truest!!) generalization: “The M. knows that one too,”
                        but <em>IN DETAIL</em> you are (probably of necessity, my poor friend!!) forced
                        to <em>act against your own words</em> because you are so trying to watch the
                        process of your own deliverance!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hence the “analysis” like (a) above (knocking down all statements).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But IF WHAT YOU SAY WERE TRUE then any Tom, Dick or Harry -- &amp; in particular
                        the "Dick" that is you, <em>could set up in business as an A.P.</em> (not “Alfred
                        Pulyan” but “awakened person”!) and have an orgy of destruction, name-calling, epithet-inventing,
                        &amp; so forth, while looking hopefully to CURING his dupes. But, physician heal
                        thyself!! It might not work. In <em>rare</em> cases it might! But, oh boy, what
                        a mess --- what a fight! However there are quite a number of people who <em>do</em>
                        habitually act this way; in a mild degree Groucho Marx, Alexander King, Alexander
                        Woollcott, -- in fact most intellectuals, especially those just emerged from the
                        egg -- &amp; even you with your “dialectical attack” &amp; “analytical affront”
                        on the fairer &amp; pleasanter sex.

                        Everything above may be true &amp; we may <em>both</em> know it. “The M. knows

                        Your whole letter, as I said, is really excellent.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top:0;">
                        You get involved here &amp; there and of course you feel it &amp; you say, very
                        naturally, “What the hell!!” But here are cases where you <em>try to go further</em>
                        as in (a) above &amp; investigate <em>my</em> technique:
                    </p>
                    <p class="item">
                        (b) “I presume anything I might say would be superfluous. So I keep my words to
                        a minimum.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        The <em>second</em> sentence is very true &amp; honest. Often people say “I can
                        find nothing to say to you.” They then go to someone else and deliver themselves
                        of 25,000 assorted words on the same subject!! Literary men say often “I have no
                        ideas and stare at a blank page.” Wow! Again they <em>have</em> millions (&amp;
                        can “breed” more at that --- ), but they are NOT <em>satisfied</em> with what they
                        have, so they clam up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus you put your finger on it “<em>I</em> KEEP MY WORDS --- “ etc. But “I” is at
                        the moment <em>my enemy</em>, the enemy of Alfred Robert Pulyan! So I say -- do
                        <em>not</em> do so. So talk! &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Orders!</em> <span class="checkmark">&#10003;</span>
                        <!-- checkmark in the right margin -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You say, “But I don’t wanna talk.” That is your disagreeable task &amp; you have
                        my sympathy! UB-GUB doesn’t help!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your first sentence “I PRESUME ---” shows the first wound to ego. It hurts.
                        He retreats. That is all. But such a “light affliction” can “win so great a prize”
                        (Christianity has all the words somewhere!).<sup>1</sup>

                        <em>integration</em> demands a fusion of thinking &amp; feeling. <em>You may not even
                            be able to define “feeling”</em>; “intuition” is on the <em>intellectual or thinking</em>

                        “feeling,” “intuition” &amp; “imagination” &amp; <em>see</em> if they can help &amp;

                        “Psychic research” &amp; the less respectable religion of Spiritualism attempt to
                        answer this. So does the Western group of religions &amp; some of the Eastern ones
                        (like Shin-shu &amp; its “happy Western land” presided over by Amida or Amithaba
                        who helps us to the “awakening” we have missed on earth).

                        These things (1) &amp; (2) are not very compatible! Researchers try to get messages
                        through -- via a medium -- from their loved ones deceased, but rarely look around
                        in society to find where their loved one has “reincarnated”!! Of course there may
                        be a longer time between incarnations --- As a factual matter Spiritualism fights
                        Reincarnation --- &amp; so does Christianity.

                        We seek what is <em>common</em> to all, not what is unique. You mention “personalities”
                        or “faces” -- <em>all</em> are “real” as such &amp; that is awkward, isn’t it?!
                        Listen to a man’s voice change as he gets a “female” voice on the phone, or a salesman
                        trying to sell him a Canadian copper-mine stock or an old friend or his wife or
                        “the priest,” or the boss, or a child ---

                    <p>
                        So you ask -- <em>how</em> in the name of God does he talk <em>when alone</em>?

                        in white with a butterfly net? You can always talk to “God”! But apart from the
                        fact that you do not know what you are addressing (&amp; what language It talks!)
                        it would involve “sincerity” -- and that is very tiring, rather objectionable --

                        Psychoanalysis goes into minute detail but no synthesis appears even after five
                        years. Other “therapies” are usually gentle -- &amp; so very long. No doubt a kid-glove
                        technique might be possible -- but with the same result requires the same “pain”

                        many others have actually a raw &amp; inflamed ego that cannot bear the gentlest
                        touch. If a waiter says “Not that fork, sir”

                        they would never recover. Actually the pain is absurd and quite unreal. In business
                        some pretty crude terms are used (tricky old son-of-a-bitch &amp; so forth) but

                        The ego does not surrender “in vacuo.” There are attendant circumstances. Otherwise
                        it would be open theoretically for the most unlikely people to “go over the hump”
                        all of a sudden. However intelligence is requisite, even cunning, or “discrimination”
                        (which sounds better). Also the highest of “standards,” a deep love of beauty (although
                        not of a “formal” nature -- you will know what I mean, no pretentious yak-yak) ----
                        so that the “change-over” occurs because for a moment you are already there anyway.
                        That is why “bhakti” or devotion is considered so good a “way” by the Hindus (&amp;
                        myself, since if “bhakti” is sufficiently pure it is the very experience we seek&nbsp;-- ).

                        I am really speaking of “feeling” as additional to “knowing,” of “spontaneity” as
                        opposed to a “system,” of a full man.

                        For our first aim then let us see if we can agree. Not <em>verbally</em> because
                        that is a mere nothing, but in detail. Thus you would investigate, analyze or attack
                        vigorously anything not clear -- but use legitimate arguments (not devices!).

                        “<em>Yoga</em>” -- if we “<em>decide</em>” to meditate we have one strike against
                        us! Besides it is <em>a do-it-yourself technique</em>. Those are only for <em>heroes</em>.
                        <em>How</em> to decide not to decide? Wu-wei. Hatha-Yoga seeks to “control.” You
                        control more than you can handle (in the body) already. You need to “decontrol.”

                        “<em>We cannot follow science &amp; intuition</em>.” Intuition <em>is</em> the method
                        of science -- I feel you regard “intuition” as a higher faculty than it is, it is
                        only <em>short-cut thinking</em> &amp; does not include ESP &amp; other methods,
                        or alleged methods, of direct knowledge. In other words if “intuition” represents
                        your advance upon “intellection” it is a trifling one and in the same field. What
                        do you think “intuition” is?

                        “<em>Nothing</em>” In many of your letters you voice the curious fear that you might
                        become a “nothing.” The fact is that you are NOW a “nothing,” but you can be a “something.”
                        Another metaphor is the top of a submerged iceberg (7/8 under water) -- &amp; I
                        do <em>not</em> mean the “subconscious.”

                        You can <em>have</em> “attachment” &amp; anything else you like <em>after</em> you
                        have done what is needful. I am not suggesting your way of life -- only the way
                        to being <em>able</em> to “live.” The “cast” is while the broken leg heals, not
                        the normal way of living. I am not prescribing <em>WAYS OF LIFE</em>, I am trying
                        to work a change-over <em>experience</em>. <em>You confuse means with ends</em>! The
                        scaffolding is not the skyscraper. Questions about what you are &amp; where you
                        go <em>have no place</em> in the “work” we are doing, which is to free you to
                        judge &amp; act (or at least to know whether it <em>is</em> “you” or what it
                        is).

                        Jesus &amp; Gautama &amp; others elaborated a philosophy from their understanding.
                        So have I. So could you. But to use it to <em>get</em> the understanding is ridiculous.
                        Hence the folly -- <em>utter</em> folly -- of reading books on philosophy etc. (And
                        that cuts out thousands of enticing old &amp; new issues.)
