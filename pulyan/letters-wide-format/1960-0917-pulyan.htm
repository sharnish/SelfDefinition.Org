					<p class="salutation">
						Dear Richard,
					</p>
					<p>
						It is necessary to establish <em>some</em> communication between us, even if
						I have to wave a rattle to do it. So come out from that corner &amp; don’t look
						at me that way! (“Joke” please note. I refer to our treatment of psychotics, humorously.)
						But one must have <em>something in common</em> ---
					</p>
					<p>
						I suppose the only thing is to look at the positive statements you make &amp; see
						what you <em>DO</em> say.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						SO! : --
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-9em;width: 9em;">
						<em>ADVICE</em>!!
					</div>
					<p class="item">
						(1) <em>“It is up to you to validate ‘certain claims’ or try another tack.”</em>
					</p>
					<p class="item">
						(a) “up to you”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a child saying “up to you mother to do this
						or that, because you love me, or I shall throw myself in the river.” Actually you
						speak as though I wished to gain converts to a movement! There is no “movement”!
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -9rem; width: 8rem; top:1rem;font-size:80%;">
						THERE IS NO MIRACLE HOWEVER SPECTACULAR TO CHANGE YOU. EVEN <em>GOD</em> CANNOT
						DO IT! <em>(OBVIOUSLY)</em>
					</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						It <em>is</em> desirable that you should “validate” me, &amp; actually essentially
						part of the process, but I can force nothing &amp; directly prove nothing. Could
						Gautama or Jesus? No -- only words. Their disciples had to invent a crop of “miracles”
						which <em>actually help not at all in our quest</em> &amp; Gautama &amp; Jesus
						protested several times. Cf. Gautama’s story of the ferryman &amp; the monk who
						could walk on the water.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -9rem; width: 8rem;top:2.5rem;font-size:80%;">
						YOU MUST GIVE ME THE REINS. I AM NOT FORCING ANYTHING -- MERELY BEING <em>AVAILABLE</em>.
					</div>
					<p class="item">
						(b) “try another tack”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the “technique” is not your affair.
						You are not <em>that</em> objective yet!! The usual agreement is that the student
						agrees to continue <em>whatever</em> happens, or is said, &amp; the Zen monk
						is kept waiting a day or so before he even gets through the gate. Your ego is RIDING
						HIGH still, &amp; that just won’t do, because it is the reverse of our objective.
					</p>
					<p class="item">
						(2) <em>“I am interested in knowing the truth”</em>
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -9rem; top:-1em; width: 8em;font-size:80%;">
						MILDLY <em>INTERESTED</em>?</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						There is <em>only one way</em> &amp; that is to quit the egocentric position.
						This is <em>rough</em> &amp; needs a catalyst, a friend, an outside fulcrum.
						One must first “decide not to decide” which is IMPOSSIBLE -- SO one has to <em>have help in dropping
							“decision” itself --- once ---</em>
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						<em>No</em> push-button methods exist. Jesus you remember looked sadly at one
						young man, God will not come for you with a wheelbarrow! So face it! Either you
						get nowhere while you live or you do it the hard way. No “royal” road!!!!! (made
						easy for kings &amp; R). So I ask HOW MUCH INTERESTED? Enough to do violence to
						pretty little ego? Do you want it as much as “air”?

						(3) <em>“I am looking for fellow-seekers, preferably those who know more than myself”</em>
						&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						Well! There are <em>no degrees of attainment</em>, no more or less. It is first a
						way of technique &amp; discipline &amp; then, BOOM! -- a discontinuity, an abyss
						-- the mosquito bites the iron ball, the impossible just naturally happens &amp;
						life is normal -- Your life now is absurd. But the brainwashed doesn’t know it --
						or shall we say the unfortunate victim of a post-hypnotic suggestion? (These are
						merely vague illustrations -- call off your dichotomizing dogs!) As for “seeking
						for seeking’s sake” that is really ODD! Paradox! Better <em>imagine</em> a $100
						bill in your apartment &amp; seek for it all your life. Then there is <em>little danger</em>
						&nbsp;of finding it !!
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						When I “sought” I said <em>by God I hope I get it</em>, not I shall have fun in the
						frustrating process. “Knock &amp; it shall be opened unto you.” “<em>No. No. No.</em>”
						“What is the trouble?” “Alfred,” -- this is R speaking -- “<em>there is ONE THING TO DO</em>.”
						“What?” “<em>SCREW UP THE DOOR</em>.”
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						(Alfred: -- “but why worry? You are all screwed up ANYWAY!”)

						(4) <em>“You are first a correspondent until I can find what you are”</em>

						<em>Good thing I am used to this game</em> or I should say TOODLE-OO &amp; go
						round the corner with a wave of the hand in farewell. <em class="double">Then</em> how do you
						“find out”? If ever? <em>Perhaps</em> such a chance will not occur again? <em>Perhaps</em>
						&nbsp;you are throwing away something inconceivably important? (I DON’T SAY YOU
						ARE.)<br />
						<em>Perhaps</em> you are as much of an idiot as I was at the age of twenty when
						I <em>missed my chance</em> by pussyfooting? Are you so “SURE” <em>now</em> of
						what you will “FIND” --- that you can risk <em>now</em> what you may “find” a
						little later? Where is your OPTION, your INSURANCE POLICY?

							ME <em>MEANWHILE</em>?<br />
							MY EAGERNESS TO “SAVE” YOU? I AM MORE PATIENT THAN YOU WOULD BE IN THE SAME POSITION,
							SINCE I AM OBJECTIVE AND WAIT TO SEE IF THERE IS SOMETHING POSSIBLE WITHIN A REASONABLE

						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						If you are <em>sure</em> you will find that this is all a mare’s nest then
						<em>OK&nbsp;-- you are safe</em>. But if you are <em>sure</em>, why continue? It seems your
						position is tragically <em>illogical</em>. If you are of the opinion that there is
						<em>some chance</em> that I am all I have asserted then why not be SMART, play
						it cozy --- ?
					</p>
					<p>
						Suppose I say I have a $10,000 bill to give you one day (&amp; I have done more
						than that!). Do you put such a person “on probation” subject to investigation. I
						wouldn’t! I would “play the guy along” in every way, especially if I really though
						<em>there was a chance he had the mazuma</em>.

						<em>“Just tell me”</em>

						!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not <em>publish</em> it then in some magazine &amp; tell <em>everybody.</em>

						SCHIZOPHRENIA,<br /> <em>PARANOIA</em>
					</div>

					<p>
						The <em>seeds</em> of both of these exist in all of us.
					</p>
					<p class="item">
						(1) <em>Paranoia</em> of course stems merely from the <em>boss</em> conception
						that ego has of himself. Blown up as big as an ox he will fancy that he can alter
						the world, govern nations, order everybody about.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -11em; width: 15em; text-align: left;">
						(1) <em>All ego-</em><br />
						or <em>no ego-<br />
							domination</em>.
					</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						So the humble “awakened” person is accused of paranoia but he only issues orders
						“on request” &amp; “by agreement” <em>when a student asks him to do so for a purpose.</em>
						He does NOT reform the world or seek power. He is no Richelieu, “eminence grise”
						or power behind the throne -- just lives inconspicuously &amp; usually dies the
						same way (unless his disciples BLOW HIM UP!!)
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -11em; width: 9em; text-align: left;">
						<br />
						<br />
						(2) Two egos !!
					</div>
					<p class="item">
						(2) <em>Schizophrenia</em> &nbsp;This is used as a <em class="double">device</em> by the
						ego to pretend objectivity. You “seem” to be cooperating with me <em>to process your own self.</em>
						Thus you are both objective &amp; subjective apparently ---
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						You attempt to <em>see our work from the outside</em>, to <em>advise</em>, to <em>assess
							progress</em>, to <em>make modifications</em>, to <em>help me work with you</em>,
						&amp; so forth &amp; you speak of Richard <em>in a Godlike way</em> -- “is he an escapist
						or a dreamer?” “I saw myself from above the world” “Best wishes for an early success”
						(DETACHED IN APPEARANCE ONLY!! ACTUALLY THIS IS AN EGO TRICK, ONE OF MANY.)
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -10rem; width: 8rem; text-align: left;">
						<em>OBJECTION</em>
					</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						“But,” says Richard, “I am <em>not</em> working with you yet. I first have to know
						somehow if you have any qualifications whatever. So let me see your stuff.”
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-14rem;width:12rem;top:-1.5rem;">
						(I could switch you to a roshi or to other friends I know who are awakened -- if
						they would take you -- but few work this way, maybe none except the commercial rackets.)
					</div>
					<p>
						What stuff? What do you <em>expect</em> -- miracles? Well, I have helped in some
						remarkable things but they are no more miraculous than anything else! Specifically
						I cannot levitate, or turn chalk into cheese, or raise the dead, or even see things
						at a distance or practice mental telepathy!
					</p>
					<p>
						Apart from them there will be nothing at all, no sign, no evidence. My <em>friends,</em>
						when they became friends, found there was a transmission, they <em>did</em> become
						sure -- but how I don’t know.
