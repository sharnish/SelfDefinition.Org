					<p class="salutation">
						Dear Dick,
					</p>
					<p>
						No, it is very difficult to solve the cosmic problem oneself, because for the “self”
						to abandon (even for a fraction of a second which is <em>all</em> that is necessary)
						its own proud assumption of being the ultimate decider is, as I have so often said,
						almost impossible.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is because to “decide” not to decide is a paradox, like lifting yourself up.
						Of course if you hold onto a horizontal bar you <em>can</em> lift yourself off the
						ground &amp; in the same way you must use an awakened person to “help” (like the horizontal
						bar).
					</p>
					<p>
						A person who will patiently “work” with you without complaining, without hope of
						reward or desire for it, for years if necessary, must have something &amp; it is rather
						over-skeptical to doubt it. No doubt there are a lot of goofy people who think they
						are a Jesus or God, but you can surely tell them pretty quickly &amp; they are NOT the
						type to reason with you patiently for years.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you will allow me to say so your skepticism is <em>beyond</em> the ordinary allowance
						even for an “intellectual” &amp; verges upon the ungracious &amp; unkind. As a mathematician
						&amp; former auditor my standards of proof are very, very high &amp; exacting, but I do
						not “hold out” when a sufficient level of proof has been reached. In a bank audit
						or the audit of a commercial concern we were <em>always</em> watchful but did not
						fall into pathological doubt-fancies. When doubt ceases to be a servant &amp; becomes
						your master &amp; you wonder if there is an octopus hiding behind the .04 stamp on my
						letter then you are in a bad way.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now unfortunately doubt in itself is not evil, but <em>allied to resistance it
							can go against the flow of life</em> &amp; I can usually tell by looking at a person
						or after a
						<!-- -->

						<!-- start page 2 of letter, page number 133 -->
						<!-- -->
						brief conversation, whether they are of this type &amp; so dangerously vulnerable to
						tensions, lack of circulation &amp; consequent bad troubles in the body. That is why
						such “constipated” &amp; “withdrawn” obstinacy can crumple in a flood of tears at a
						religious healing meeting AND ACTUALLY PRODUCE RESULTS! (Whether the religion taught
						is nonsense or fact is not the point. It is the <em>softening of attitude</em> that
						is so vital. We try to be so rock-ribbed, we poor mortals!)
					</p>
					<p class="noindent note">[ page 2 ]</p>
					<p>
						Fortunately even though life may get rough “all will be well, very well.” I cannot
						<em>logically</em> prove this but <em>it is a fact</em> (if you will let your friend
						make a mere assertion of what is true by his own experience), &amp; it is a fact according
						to a lot of others too, that there is a Something <em>that seeks us individually &amp; personally
							with a humility &amp; open simplicity we lack</em>. The poem “The Hound of Heaven”
						illustrates this (by Francis Thompson: “I fled Him, down the nights &amp; down the days ... ”).
					</p>
					<p>
						It does not matter when you encounter such a person as myself, except that if you
						do not feel well it is much harder for you to “work.”
					</p>
					<p>
						In your case not being a medical man I do not know what thing will help one of your
						troubles &amp; harm another perhaps. My own teacher when her mother had bad bronchitis
						(had to have injections) gave her some high potency <em>C vitamin</em> tablets &
						told her to eat them freely!! (A 500 mg tablet of Vit. C is equivalent perhaps to
						a quart of orange juice as regards Vitamin C.)
					</p>
					<p>
						For a condition like that I would get the 100 tablets of 500 mg Vit. C from Hudson
						for $1.35 (postage ppd.) or else if the <em>acid</em> was not desired then get the
						Plus Formula 279, Vit. C powder, 50 grams -- $1.95, “soluble in cold liquid, acid-free”
						from Plus Products (see pink slips). Maybe you would ask your doctor to see <em>if it
							would do harm</em>. If <em>not</em>, try it!! because I wouldn’t be stopped
						merely by the fact that the use of massive doses of Vit. C to reduce infections
						is *<em>experimental</em>. (Of the 100 tablets or the 50 grams of powder I would use
						in my own case half during one week, then rest a week, then use the other half.
						This works out about 7 tablets a day or 3500 mg a day, or about 3 1/2 grams a day.)

						*<br /> Has been since 1948. When will they ‘know’?

					<p>
						Also, I feel that Yogurt would possibly be helpful &amp; containers of this are easily
						available at .19 &amp; .25 which will last two times at least. They can be flavored
						with fruit syrups, popular in this weather, such as Cherry, Strawberry, Grape, Orange
						etc. &amp; Yogurt is then easy to take.</p>

						(Plus Products have a fine Torula Yeast which provides a good balance of the B vitamins,
						an almost complete protein (it is 50% protein anyway) &amp; lots of minerals) -- I do
						not want to divert your mind however from the suggestions on page 2 which you could
						check. Nor do I know if you are dieting &amp; if so how.)
					</p>
					<p>
						“Awakening” is perhaps a sad knowledge -- like growing up! But I asked my teacher
						if she would “go back” &amp; she said “No!” Now I myself can answer my own question!
						My answer is “I would not think of it. No!” I remember in New York getting a telephone
						installed for her &amp; her husband. I felt, “This is the end! Tomorrow there will be
						thousands of people lining the street &amp; sitting on the sidewalk &amp; steps -- all waiting
						to see her and get enlightenment.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Surprise! There wasn’t one. Only me &amp; a few private students of hers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nor are there more than a handful who write to me now. Yet this is worth more than
						all the wealth of the world because the wealth of the world will not buy it.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I was young I day-dreamed of course &amp; thought I would like to be <em>not</em>
						famous, but wise! The “power behind the throne,” another Richelieu!! Knowing more
						than professors, scientists, religious leaders, philosophers, everybody!! Now I
						<em>do</em> know more than most &amp; the pride is no longer there, that is dust and
						ashes, burnt out. There is much sympathy left &amp; I do what I can &amp; sometimes I get
						beautiful letters full of gratitude; <em>rarely</em> from ‘famous’ people, although
						I know two or three authors &amp; lawyers, a minister or two, housewives, psychotherapists,
						night-watchmen, bum, Buddhists, Jews, Christians, agnostics ---- but none in the
						<em>topmost</em> ranks like Jung &amp; so forth. Jesus said they were too smart for
						their own good. <em>I was too</em>. What an insufferable, snooty, sneery, smart-aleck
						I was. (Hope I have improved at least a little!) I knew it all. My mind was free
						from prejudice, open, capable of judging -- IN A PIG’S EYE!!! A good thing we don’t
						know our own motives &amp; weaknesses.

						Our intellect is based on a miscellaneous grab-bag of assorted memory-junk &amp; prejudices
						arrived at <em>largely by accident</em> (what we read, heard, saw ---). We are not
						even properly programmed for our job like an IBM machine!
					</p>
					<p>
						Yet these chance memories give the flavor to our “I” that we call “personality.”
						(We “remember” things we do not properly understand or respond to, apart from certain
						useful facts.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus the much-vaunted “I” is a collection of half-understood perceptions!
					</p>
					<p>
						And this bemused captain controls the vessel we call our ‘body.’ He is only “conscious”
						a few minutes at a time during the day! Rulers of the earth! Voyagers to the stars!
						(with a trail of empty beer-cans &amp;, mentally, a cargo of aberrations, for <span style="font-family: Segoe UI;
                            font-size: 120%;">&#945;</span>-Centauri!)
						<!-- &#945 is Greek letter lower case alpha. The font Segoe UI has support for Cyrillic  -->
					</p>
					<p>
						I wish we were kinder to the animals.
					</p>
					<p>
						I wish we were kinder to one &amp; another. There is nobody on earth, even Kruschchev,
						who will not feel one day his or her utter loneliness, utter insulation from any
						other human being. To avoid knowing this we engage in commerce (must work to eat
						you say? YES, but I have known millionaires go on working!) &amp; fill our time with
						distractions.
					</p>
					<p>
						The “work” I do helps toward breaking down this separation we <span class="nowrap">human-beings</span>
						feel. It is not necessary, it is only the impulse to defend <span class="nowrap">ourselves,
							--</span> we are terribly afraid of “coming out” just as ourselves &amp; being stepped
						on!
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a false fear. A lot of people, some professional speakers &amp; entertainers,
						are quite “open” (cf. Will Rogers), &amp; I do not mean backslappers.
					</p>
					<p>
						This “I” of ours has a better side of course. Its basis -- apart from memories --
						is the strange “self” conception. This is a <em>direct</em> reflection of the One Self &
						it is this we can see in one another.
