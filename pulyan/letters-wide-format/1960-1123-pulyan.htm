					</p>
					<p class="salutation">
						Dear Richard,
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-5rem;">
						<span style="font-size: 130%;"><em>&nbsp;?&nbsp;</em></span>
					</div>
					<p>
						<!--[Margin note: A question mark]-->
						Your question is eminently “reasonable”! What is to be done if you meet a Zen Master
						(says the koan)? Shall you talk to him, ignore him or sock him on the chin?
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>ANOTHER ATTITUDE</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Sometimes a student will say: “I give in. I am through trying to argue. I am at
						your disposal.”
					</p>
					<p>
						What do we do then? Contact God &amp; have him send a wheelbarrow to collect the
						student?
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="width:6rem;">
						<em>STUDENT HAS TO DO IT HIMSELF</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Alas! Even the saints of old wrestled with themselves for years in the desert, as
						did Gautama the “Buddha.” But the student wants supreme satisfaction, supreme enlightenment,
						health, the equivalent of a $5000 psychologist etc. --- all for a casual grudging
						word and a “might as well, it don’t cost nothing” attitude -----------
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>YOUR ATTITUDE</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						This however is <em>not yet your position</em>. You are <em>demonstrating</em> to
						me graphically that one cannot “decide or decide not to decide” or “write without
						demonstrating conceit or a pretense at reason.”
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>CONVINCED</em>?
					</div>
					<p>
						That is -- you are <em>not</em> saying: I am convinced that there is something to
						attain. How do we attain it?
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-6rem;">
						<em>NO</em>!
					</div>
					<p>
						Oh no! <em>You are just making a point</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you were “convinced” there would be MUCH to say -- in particular <em>how you had
							changed</em> from the letters before when you had all your intellectual spines
						up like a porcupine &amp; your dichotomizing “reason” all agog to tear everything
						in half ----- Then we could go on from there.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-8rem;">
						<em>I’LL SHOW HIM!</em>!
					</div>
					<p>
						But your letter is merely a device in the arguments you put up (valid or not it
						doesn’t matter) in the <em>pushing away of something you don’t especially want</em>.
						Better bring on the dancing girls to stir your jaded appetite, it won’t be until
						years start coming alarmingly quickly, perhaps, that you will awake from your leaden
						lethargy.
					</p>
					<!-- start page 2 of letter, sheet numbered 79 -->
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-8rem;">
						THEN WE ARE <em>“AT HOME”</em>
					</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						This is not “blame” of course. No ethics are involved here. If for some reason the
						time is not ripe (&amp; I do not know all the conditions that make one agog for
						“awakening”) then there are satisfactions in life to be had, “unnumbered ways of
						dream” as the poet says.<sup>1</sup>
						<!-- Grorge Russell aka "A.E." poem: "Immortality" -->

					<div class="rightoffset" style="width: 25rem; top: -3rem;">
						<p>
							<sup>1</sup><br />
							"Immortality", by A. E.
						</p>
						<p>
							WE MUST pass like smoke or live within the spirit’s fire;<br />
							For we can no more than smoke unto the flame return<br />
							If our thought has changed to dream, our will unto desire,<br />
							As smoke we vanish though the fire may burn.
						</p>
						<p>
							Lights of infinite pity star the grey dusk of our days:<br />
							Surely here is soul: with it we have eternal breath:<br />
							In the fire of love we live, or pass by many ways,<br />
							By unnumbered ways of dream to death.
						</p>
						<p>
					</div>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-8rem;">
						HALF AN HOUR A DAY?<br />
						<em>NOT THAT</em>!
					</div>
					<p>
						And after all how much in any day are most persons <em>actually</em> even “conscious”?
						Only when it becomes necessary to make a decision! Thus a person could be fully
						aware &amp; awake from 8 - 8.03 am, 12 - 12.05 pm, 7 - 7.05 pm etc. --- &amp; could
						wear a sign “open for business as follows: ----”
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>A TEST</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Ouspensky says you could be walking down the street &amp; could say to yourself:
						“I must remember myself.” Then you would go on: “I know I see a taxi passing. I
						know a man &amp; a woman are going by. I see the building across the street. I know
						----” and all of a sudden it is <em>three hours later</em> &amp; you say: “My goodness.
						I forgot to remember myself!”
					</p>
					<p>
						We are prisoners of our day-dreaming. And so life goes by -------
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -9rem; width: 10rem;top:0;">
						<em>NOTE<br />
							HOWEVER</em>
						<span style="display:inline-block;font-size: 22pt;text-align:right;">&rarr;</span>
					</div>
					<p>
						<!--[<em>NOTE HOWEVER</em> - followed by an arrow pointing to this sentence]-->
						(But you will realize this is NOT the “awakening” <em>I</em> refer to. <em>That is not
							voluntary</em> -- even though one “works” toward it.)
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -9rem; width: 8rem; top: 1.2rem;">
						<em>BOOK</em><br />
						<span style="font-size: 80%;">(HE TRIES TO AVOID “INTELLECTUALIZING” AND THEN FLOPS
							RIGHT INTO IT!)<br />
							BUT GET IT.</span>
					</div>
					<p>
						I was merely sketching a way of life, the usual one. There is a Mentor book “The
						Teachings of the Mystics” by Walter T. Stace (MD306, .50) [published 1960] and although
						he is only a philosopher, &amp; mixes up “mystical experiences” with “awakening,”
						nevertheless it might help to establish the <em>mere existence</em> of that which
						I speak &amp; which I claim to know myself &amp; to have assisted others to.
						<!-- published 1960 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Teachings_of_the_Mystics -->

					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -11rem; width: 8rem;">
						BACK TO THE<br /><em>PROBLEM</em> ...
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						<em>ONE OCCASION ONLY!</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						<!--[<em>BACK TO THE PROBLEM</em> ... ]-->
						I find it <em>quite possible</em> to write “awakened” friends! It is perhaps necessary
						to be genuinely “open” &amp; not snide or tricky, but to be just naturally friendly.
						There is no reason to avoid “reason” especially when it is keen “discrimination.”
						<!--[<em>ONE OCCASION ONLY!</em>]-->
						As for “egotism” &amp; “conceit” those are our birthrights -- yours &amp; mine,
						but ONCE, just ONCE and “really truly” <em>they must be shed</em>. <em>After that</em>
						you can <em>resume</em> -- but it won’t be quite the same!
