						Dear Dick,
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -7rem;">
						<em>QUERY 1</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						“How can you be sure of me (A.R.P.) without having met me, when I said that even after
						meeting someone I wasn’t sure of their attainment?”
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -7rem;">
						<em>ANSWER</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Touché! <em>Very reasonable</em>, but who guaranteed the Buddha? This whole business
						reeks with paradox.
					</p>
					<br />
					<div class="leftoffset" style="top: -1rem;left: -7rem;">
						<em>CONSIDERATIONS</em>
					</div>
					<div style="margin-left: 4rem;">
						<p class="item">
							(1) If Krishnamurti offered to “work” with you &amp; to do so as a friend then <em>it
								would be foolish to refuse</em>. He is <em>a long way further on</em> than you
							&amp; that I think is <em>a reasonable inference</em> (from lectures, books, acquaintance
							etc.). My remark <em>should not have been made</em> . It turned on a <em>very technical
								point</em> only appreciable after experience.
						</p>
						<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -11rem;width:5rem;top:-4rem;">
							I did not say I was <em>sure</em>.
						</div>
						<p class="item">
							(2) Do you ask a FRIEND’S bona-fides?
						</p>
						<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -11rem;">
							<em>ENDLESS BACKCHAT</em>!
						</div>
						<p class="item">
							(3) Unless you solve this dilemma somehow “work” will never even <em>begin</em>!
							We are only “nagging” now.
						</p>
						<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -11rem;">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACT!
							<br />
							SAY YES OR “GOODBYE,” BUT REFLECT.
						</div>
						<p class="item">
							(4) To give an <em>opinion</em> is one thing but to <em>act</em> is another. If
							I were “unawakened” &amp; had the offer you had from some person claiming awakening
							I would be careful <em>not to lose him completely</em> because if I was <em>wrong</em>
							I should have thrown away all that life has to offer &amp; if I was <em>right</em>
							I should have merely prevented some extra trouble for myself, writing, attending
							sessions or what not (where I could have acquired something anyway).
						<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -11rem; top: -5rem;">
							(PASCAL’S WAGER ALL OVER AGAIN -- BUT THIS TIME A CLEAR DICHOTOMY.)
						</div>
						Time is now running out for you because we are at a definite IMPASSE &amp; writing
						is becoming <em>futile</em> -- in fact to be honest it seems so now. Don’t forget
						-- I know “me,” you don’t. But I realize this means nothing from your angle.
						<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -11rem;top: 2rem;">
							OTHERS “AWAKENED”
						</div>
						<p class="item">
							(5) A lot of other people DID NOT HAVE YOUR DIFFICULTY. They soon made up their
							minds. A few however refused abruptly and saved yak yak.

						<em>QUERY 2</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						“A concept to be acceptable must explain more than its predecessors.”
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>ANSWER</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Experience -- even sensory experience as of a color or sound -- is not describable
						or graspable by <em>any</em> kind of concept whatsoever.
					</p>
					<p>
						Experience is our goal.
					</p>
					<p>

					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>QUERY 3</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						“Aquinas inferred that the finite mind can never perceive the infinite.”
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>ANSWER</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						He may well have done so whilst writing all that nonsense (the “Summa Contra Gentiles”
						etc.) because that is the same state you are in -- concepts.
					</p>
					<p>
						But <em>six months before his death</em> (and <em>my</em> authority is the Catholic
						Encyclopedia) he had such an experience that he said all his writings were <em>CHAFF</em>
						(actual word). Yet people still study the nonsense. The Catholic Encyclopedia’s
						authority is a personal friend of Aquinas &amp; the episode is not controverted
						-- except by the fact that idiots waste their lives on the “great” Summa, <em>still</em>.
						(Idiots study books &amp; metaphysics. I was one.)
					</p>
					<p>
						------------------------------------------------------------------------
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>QUERY 4</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						“What do you think of Van der Leeuw’s ‘Conquest of Illusion’?” Ask Mac. It would
						be more to the point if you substituted Pulyan for Van der Leeuw. I realize this
						is not a natural thing to do -- but look at it (IF YOU CAN!) from my angle. If you
						“work” with me then <em>I</em> am the “master” not all the authors of various books.
						Books will NOT produce awakening, however interesting &amp; so forth.
					</p>
					<p>
						------------------------------------------------------------------------
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>QUERY 5</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						“The greatest difficulty I have with you is trying to put you in a category.”
					</p>
					<p>
						I have no category &amp; you might as well stop this foolish effort at being patronizing
						&amp; the “great investigator.” I am not threatening, believe me, but don’t you
						agree <em>we are getting nowhere</em>? This must peter out &amp; that is always
						regrettable. We <em>can</em> however part pleasantly.

						P.S.

					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>QUERY 6</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Sorry I forgot this one &amp; it is a lulu. “Let me ask you for the reasons for
						your interest in other people --- is this some sort of law which must be followed,
						or do you expect further help for helping others?”
					</p>
					<p class="item">
						(A) People are tethered to a pole like an animal.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						It is ”self,” ego &amp; it controls them.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						Thus they always look for an ego-motive, “what’s in it for me?” etc. &amp; this
						they regard as a TRUISM!
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						It reminds me of the science-fiction story where a man visited a planet where “utility”
						ruled -- he observed their plain vases &amp; cups &amp; so on &amp; one day painted
						a <em>pattern</em> on one!
					</p>
					<p>
						Consternation! Whatever was the UTILITY of this? (they could not understand any
						other reason for such an action, or any action).
					</p>
					<p>
						To be “outgoing,” friendly <em>for its own sake</em> is regarded on this third planet
						(Earth) as prime aberration!! (or fishy).
					</p>
					<p>
						However if you want an ego-reason let me say that I have been very well paid in
						advance in a peculiar way --
					</p>
					<p>
						But this is <em>false as a reason</em> because NOBODY takes money or its equivalent
						for this work unless in actual need &amp; then only as between friends who SHARE
						ALL THEY HAVE. Don’t be alarmed! (I do not refer to all the fanciful organizations.)

						(B) On another plane consider that we are disguised modes of the One
						<span class="nowrap">Self-Consciousness &amp;</span> although separated into so many of us it strives to realize
						itself in each of us &amp; to unite again. This is crudely stated I know, but not
						so far from the truth.
					</p>
					<p class="item">
						(C) Psychologically consider that as we descend into deeper &amp; deeper
						depths of psychosis we tend to become more &amp; more concentrated on self to the
						exclusion of others, even in the minutest details.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						Instead of being “open” we become “withdrawn.” Thus <em>sanity</em> demands the
						attitude that so puzzles you.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						PS</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						Your motto is "Stop giving me facts, they confuse me. I refer to the "angelic Doctor",
						query No. 3, also to query No. 2. As far as our "work", friendship is not a state
						you can ARGUE yourself into. It happens or it doesn't and there you are.</p>
