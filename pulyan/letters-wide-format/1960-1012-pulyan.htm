                        Dear Dick,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Evasive” would imply that I am avoiding deliberately (since my eyes are supposed
                        to be wide open) a logical or reasonable reply to your questions &amp; remarks.
                        So let me take all your specific questions as a minimum and segregate the topics,
                        thus: --
                    </p>
                    <p class="item">
                        (1) <em>GOD</em> <em>Why did I choose this particular word?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        (You and I know it is semantically precarious &amp; carries a heavy “charge” of
                        meaning, put there by theological know-it-alls.)
                    </p>
                    <p class="item">
                        (a) Well, first, what is the origin of the word? The Jews used Jahweh (or at least
                        JHVH leaving the vowels to be forgotten as the name was tabu), Jesus used “abba”
                        (Father) in Aramaic. The Jews also used Adonai (Lord), Elohim &amp; other words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “God” is <em>not</em> cognate with “good” apparently &amp; is <em>some old
                            German or Gothic deity, now obsolete</em>. He may have had a wife &amp; may have
                        required weird rituals. I wish I knew more of his origin!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However some names for the One are <em>very impersonal &amp; ineffable</em> like
                        the Tao (Way), the Brahman, the Dharmakaya, etc. Others are <em>personal</em> like
                        Allah, Jehovah, (Yahveh), God, Krishna, Siva, Brahma (the masculine member of the
                        Brahman trinity -- there is one temple to him, none to the Brahman), Chemosh (the
                        god of the Moabites who amuses me by his name somehow, as also Lord Dunsany, &amp;
                        to whom Solomon made a “high place” outside old Jerusalem, but who was a bloodthirsty
                        old ruffian, worse than Jehovah if possible) &amp; so forth.
                    </p>

                    <p class="noindent">
                        I find in practice that I have <em>a harder time</em> with Buddhists for example
                        because <em>they will only exchange ego’s pride for their ineffably ineffable.</em>
                        Since the ineffably ineffable is <em>so remote</em> they too become inaccessible,
                        since ego has pitched his goal deliberately (!) out of reach, inconceivably. HE
                        JUMPS RIGHT OVER THE HORSE. “He” means a Buddhist student e.g. whose “Dharmakaya”
                        is very remotely ineffable (like the word “Absolute”).
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="left: -8rem; width: 8em; top: 1rem;">
                        <em>MANLIKE<br />DEITIES</em>

                    <p class="noindent">
                        Conversely the Jews, Christians etc. have an anthropomorphic “God” whatever they
                        say to the contrary.
                        In practice he reflects their anger, frustration, sadism, weariness, &amp; so forth.
                        They JUMP SHORT OF THE HORSE.
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        We want to jump RIGHT ON THE HORSE of course. Now since the One Self is <em>intimately associated with us,</em>
                        although NOT on a “personality” basis I have less trouble PULLING THE JEWS, CHRISTIANS
                        <em>UP</em> A BIT than PULLING THE BUDDHISTS, TAOISTS, HINDUS, INTELLECTUALS,
                        PHILOSOPHERS, ETC. <em>DOWN</em> A BIT, A BIG BIT!!
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        <em>It is a practical matter</em>. Ego can take a delight in being very SUBTLE,
                        very OCCULT, very INEFFABLE whereas the primitive religionist can be too childish,
                        affectionate, etc. instead of CHILD-<em>LIKE</em>, SIMPLE, LOVING.

                        Jesus &amp; Peter is converted into a mere question &amp; answer THREE TIMES repeated
                        POINTLESSLY. It is <em>even</em> repeated in the Revised Standard Version. It

                        Again Jesus asks: “Do you <i><em class="double">love</em></i>&nbsp;me?” (ἀγαπάω -- with emphasis).</p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        Peter says “You know I love you (φιλέω)</p>

                        The third time Jesus asks tactfully &amp; sadly: “Do you love me?” (φιλέω)</p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        Peter says, “Lord, you know everything, you know I love (φιλέω) you."</p>
                    <p>
                        There are two kinds of love, <em>ἀγαπάω</em> [agapao] which is the Love I call “God”
                        &amp; <em>φιλέω,</em> [phileo] a personal &amp; mechanical love which can turn to
                        hate even. When I said “friendship” to you I meant “ἀγαπάω” which is outgoing, eternal
                        (&amp; since it is “God” himself, or itself, in us it is truly “eternal.”) Happy
                        are the people who know this rare and wonderful thing below personality level! It
                        can exist between two people of the same sex -- David &amp; Jonathan or between
                        a man &amp; woman. In the latter case it overrides “sex,” “sex” is <em>its conscious
                            servant</em> &amp; supremely natural. Then the man &amp; woman are equals &amp;
                        their association (“married” in the customary sense or <em>not</em>) is a “sacrament”
                        in some old &amp; <em>genuine usage of this term</em>. The woman is not merely a
                        convenient receptacle for a sex organ and intercourse does not lead to satiety.
                        Alas, this is rare indeed. It can be a young man or woman’s <em>ideal</em>, but
                        they usually settle for <em>less</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here then is the “love” of two child-selves (wise as serpents and innocent as babes)
                        and it truly reflects the Source of the Universe for which I used so obsolete &amp;
                        curious a word (“God”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <em>English “Revised Version” of 1884</em> notes in margin “Peter twice uses
                        a different Greek word than Jesus.” (Not much help to a casual reader!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em> Maurice Nicholl</em> in “The New Man” (Vincent Stuart, 1955) deals with
                        it <em>in detail</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The “<em>Twentieth Century New Testament</em>” (1900) catches it &amp; uses “love”
                        as said by Jesus, and “I am your friend” as said by Peter (but that is <em>incorrect</em>
                        as “friend” is merely the wrong use of that word we all make). The “<em>New Testament
                            in Basic English</em>” (1941) also catches it &amp; uses “love” in Jesus’ first two
                        questions and “you are dear to me” as Peter’s replies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since very likely you do <em>not</em> know this “<em>heightened awareness</em>”
                        (ἀγαπάω) but only the emotion (φιλέω) you have NO REFERENT to “God.” You must naturally
                        discard all semantic overtones.</p>
                    <p>
                        This love (agape) “loves” the personality <em>for what it is</em>, good or bad, pleasant
                        or unpleasant, as a mother loves an erring son.

                        can be an urgent desire (beauty, music, Nature, love are fingers, pointing the way).
                        In that case “you do” &amp; <em>we should continue</em>. If you do <em>not</em> wish
                        to awake then clearly that too is an alternative situation and <em>we should not continue</em>
                        .

                        There is no OUGHT, SHOULD, MUST --- there is no REASON, PREFERENCE etc. I do not
                        dangle carrots before the donkey’s nose (you) although I <em>could</em>. The Old Testament
                        says “I put before you Life &amp; Death.” “Nature” is indifferent. <em>Refusal</em>
                        to know God (as opposed to ignorance that it can be done) can lead to a quicker
                        “end,” &amp; then you can nourish the trees &amp; flowers &amp; eventually recombine
                        somehow. As Shakespeare says “mighty Caesar dead &amp; turned to clay, may stop
                        a hole to keep the winds away.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why is this? Because “refusal” is an ego phenomenon. About 90% of you is autonomous
                        (fortunately) &amp; the blood circulation, digestion, involuntary muscles, glandular
                        secretions, body repairs, cell growth &amp; division, etc. etc. go on even in sleep
                        regardless of “Richard” (great &amp; mighty one -- perhaps). The other 10% is “your”
                        apparent decision. Thus <em>your stomach</em> may be saying “please, please, no
                        more sugar, or fat foods, or carbohydrates,” or whatever is wrong at the moment,
                        but <em>your hand</em> may shove more &amp; more of it in your mouth! One is involuntary,
                        one is “voluntary” (in a sense). Further, ego “channels” your modes of action &amp;
                        response, leading to tensions &amp; local lack of circulation. These can be deadly
                        &amp; one day the thing (your body) “gives” at the weakest spot. Then there is a
                        “disease” or something and it has a NAME. It may be “cured” but <em>the underlying condition</em>
                        remains. Doctors do NOT have the weeks, months &amp; years of time required to “work”
                        your body to get rid of

                        or the river. Then you are hooked. Otherwise he doesn’t want to lose you, unless
                        you are a really messy piece of goods. My case is different. It takes me a lot of
                        time and trouble to write to you (&amp; this letter is in great detail so as not
                        to seem unnecessarily “evasive”), and naturally you are no different than anyone
                        else. Nor can I work with too many people at this rate obviously. So if you are
                        merely going along for the ride, having intellectual exercise &amp; all that I would
                        appreciate your saying that <em>your interest is slight -- and thanks &amp; good-bye.</em>
                        That would avoid a hundred more letters each taking several hours (if that many

                        of the “mystical experience” (which millions have a taste of!). Thus it cannot be
                        called “unconscious”!! Further my teacher had the same &amp; the Zen &amp; Taoist

                        the animism &amp; crude fertility rites, often with human or animal sacrifice (Judaism
                        never got out of it -- at least not until much later). It was NOT AN EVOLUTION!
                        There was a world-wide upsurge of these “awakened” men. It was a “discontinuous”
                        phenomenon &amp; not explicable by the methods of the anthropologist.

                        itself through us both as human organisms &amp;, curiously enough, simultaneously
                        as our apparently “outside” perceptions, in other words -- the Universe.

                        Many words which I have already quoted (Tao, The Brahman, etc.) were used to describe

                        lectures in Taiwan for example I hear my poor efforts spoken of as “something new
                        in Asia.” Heaven help us! Another one? Subuh in Java was “awakened” in 1933 &amp;
                        here again “Subud” may develop into one of these movements alas.

                        Thus “God” is the <em>name</em> for my experience, NOT my experience was “OF GOD.”
                        First Richard <em>must know what the experience is</em>, then that it is (and was)
                        world-wide to a few, &amp; finally he can call it <em>anything he

                        This answers (partly) your question “What do you mean by ‘awakening’?” The answer
                        is that, like Buddha, I cannot tell you now but I <em>can</em> tell when you
                        or others have it, because then it is

                        with all due deference to your sensibilities they were much better human beings

                        I was very clear about this &amp; <em>my comment</em> that people rarely (except

                        (as it would to any half-perceptive person) that people do <em>NOT</em> believe
                        in it, obviously. Common-sense would tell you that. Their actions prove it. Besides
                        your body gets scattered &amp; certainly doesn’t “reincarnate” so what does? Body
                        &amp; mind are not separable. They go &amp; you know it. However I do not dogmatize
                        on “life after death” since you must <em>first</em> find out for yourself by “awakening”
                        WHAT OUR POSITION IS &amp; then, armed with this information, you may consider life

                        It is an “occupational hazard.” The psychotherapist has the same hazard (e.g. suicidal
                        &amp; homicidal cases), but <em>even he</em> cannot take his patients further
                        than he has gone (except by accident &amp; I have known such) &amp; so HE HIMSELF
                        has <em>a point</em> at which he would revert to a louse!

                        I ought to know! I was a student once myself. I am not much better now -- but I
                        am a trifle kinder &amp; a trifle more perceptive maybe!

                        Master nobody would think I had thrown a plate at my wife that morning or done a

                        Thus as Shakespeare says “the world is oft deceived by ornament” -- the PROFESSION,
                        POSITION gives ELEVATION and the “sheep” probe no deeper. But perhaps you and I

                        However it is also the truth that <em>if this thing we are doing is false</em> then
                        there is absolutely no other hope for you, me, or humanity, unless Spiritualism

                        We are <em>not</em> animals, we are human beings with some consciousness, &amp;
                        that is a deep mystery.

                        We are perhaps puppets. We are perhaps even “nothing.” But we are “nothings” that
                        <em>can</em> be “something.”

                        So make up your mind. If I ask for a photograph send it. It is the least you can
                        do. And further I do not know of any way you can escape from your frustrating ego-domination
                        except by voluntarily giving powers to some other person -- me or another if you
                        can find him or her -- <em>which will involve your obedience</em>. I had to do it,
                        I know no other way.

                        In this world you do not get something for nothing, there is always a price-tag.
                        And in this case it is “sacrifice.” I must say the price is very reasonable considering
                        the merchandise. Yet people would rather die than know the truth. That means that
                        ego is so obstinate that he would rather be extinguished than <em>step down</em>!

                        There are <em>3,000,000,000</em> like that.
