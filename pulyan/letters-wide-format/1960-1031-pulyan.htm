                        Dear Richard,
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="left: -8rem; width: 10rem; top: 1rem;">
                        <em>Brain-washing or<br />brain-sucking?</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I am not a “movement” &amp; I haven’t “sucked the brain-blood of mankind.” <em>Very
                            few</em> people write to me and those that “succeed” (even those that do not)
                        are not <em>LESS</em> &nbsp;intelligent, but more so, not less sceptical but more
                        so. My line is not belief, it is proof. However there is a paradox (IF THERE WERE
                        NOT THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BE “AWAKENED”!) -- the <em>first step</em> must be <em>belief
                            that proof will come</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like many others I wondered what satori was, what the Oriental religions were all
                        about, what Gautama, Eckhart, Lao Tse, Jesus, <span class="nowrap">Heraclitus ---</span>
                        <em>experienced</em>. I soon found that there was SOMETHING, &amp; to little Alfred
                        that was a <em>sufficient</em> &nbsp; challenge. But one has first to dip one toe
                        in the ocean.
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="left: -7rem; width: 8rem; top: 1rem;">
                        <em>Oops!</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>                        
                        Many thanks for the photograph, I see what you mean. [R. had written: “Hope it is
                        of help in your psychoanalysis.”]
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="left: -7rem; width: 8rem; top: 1rem;">
                        <em>Sense or<br />no-sense?</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>                        
                        But speaking of “brain-blood” and so forth you negate your own early words (Aug
                        17) “I have come to look upon reason as the vanity of the intellect.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The truth is you are still the Supreme Court to yourself even though Heraclitus
                        says:

                        YOU KNOW, and your letters show it, that there is absolutely no way to gain anything
                        by a verbal understanding. If one could, then let us publish it right away in the
                        magazines &amp; newspapers! By “anything” I mean “anything ultimate” as regards
                        ourselves &amp; this universe, the source of it or what is responsible for it.

                        Thus there is <em>only one way</em> left -- it is <em>work on oneself</em> &amp;
                        it is found, since you cannot decide 
                        <i><em><span style='font-style: italic'>not to decide</span></em></i>, 
                        <em>which is essential</em>, that a friend or teacher is necessary.

                        If I were “only a searcher for truth” we could go on yak-yakking our fool heads
                        off and the correspondence would <em>really</em> be piddling -- as piddling as
                        philosophy or art-criticism.

                        uninteresting, no new discoveries, not tit-bits, no theories, plodding, annoying,

                        WHY IS THIS? A <em>smart</em> fellow would see at once. I have a well-stocked
                        library, I could (&amp; have do so) write <em>fascinating</em> stuff, like, say,
                        Manly Palmer Hall in his “Horizon” magazine. There you can get the low-down, inside
                        stuff on Nostradamus, the Tarot, The Hung Society, Diana of the Ephesians, The Kundalini,
                        Dante, Blake, Mandala Magic, The Harmon Papers, The Nuremberg Chronicle, The Tribes
                        in the Light Blue Mountains &amp; so forth. (3341 Griffith Park Blvd., Los Angeles

                    <p>
                        But that is the whole trouble. These glamorous things actually leave a worse taste
                        behind. It is like knowing how the illusionists &amp; professional magicians do
                        their tricks. It gets terribly blah!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is One Self, not many. You hold it away by your insistence (like most people)
                        in holding to the hegemony [i.e., predominance] of your “self.” When your hand finally
                        releases its hold of the bedclothes your pretended “ownership” of your body (which
                        you do not even “run”) &amp; of your consciousness (as though it were a piece of
                        real estate) <em>ceases</em>, but the Consciousness goes on.
                    </p>

                        What will happen to you will happen to me.

                    <p>
                        However you <em>can</em> know the One Self-Consciousness as well as you know
                        anyone -- indeed far better. By “know” I mean really know, know by experience, know
                        by acquaintance, know intimately -- not any of the theological hot-air &amp; clap-trap.
                        I speak as a mathematician with accounting &amp; auditing background &amp; scientific
                        education -- not as a dweller on cloud 51 or a “true believer.”

                        I have been <em>successful</em>  with several friends &amp; they <em>did</em> “attain”
                        &amp; they <em>did</em> say “How could you have put up with this nonsense?” (just

                        smart-aleck R, then I know we are on the way. As yet you have merely <em>fenced</em>
                        &amp; shown no participation or understanding.

                        Heraclitus said “Dogs bark at what they do not understand.” So while I chase my

                        I am NOT a psychoanalyst -- you are fully capable of tracing your own attitude to
                        various childish manifestations -- if that <em>is</em> the cause. “I don’t wanna,
                        Mom. I don’t wanna” &amp; he grows up another C.G. Jung. Boy, oh boy. But be comforted.
                        Suzuki said of me “no hope &amp; not worth the effort.” He was right, it was IMPOSSIBLE.
                        But it happened because to the One nothing is “impossible.” So of it happened to
