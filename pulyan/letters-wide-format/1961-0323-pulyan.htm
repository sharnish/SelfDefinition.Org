					<p class="salutation">
						Dear Dick,
					</p>
					<p>
						There really IS a “way” you know &amp; you are on it, but at an early stage.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-5rem;top:3rem;">
						Rare <br /><em>too!</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Sorry you doubt my depth (!!). So many of my students have recognized right away
						that I was 100 proof, 24 carat, the real McCoy!! I was
						surprised because there is no proof, but it wasn’t real surprise because I understand
						the phenomenon.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want to know how someone “feels” toward you ask yourself how <em>you</em> feel
						about <em>them</em>. Action &amp; reaction, says Sir Isaac Newton, are equal &amp;
						opposite (&amp; so far this law has held).
					</p>
					<p>
						Feelings are funny things. So is friendship &amp; love -- <em>defying reason</em> --
						and since this matter we are dealing with is akin to both friendship &amp; love
						(“one thing” anyway) it also <em>defies reason</em> -- but not feeling.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-4rem;top:7rem;">
						<span style="font-size:20pt;">*</span>
					</div>
					<p>
						(Granted that one may be wrong once in a while -- but after I have <em>known
							a person a while</em> then there is no such possibility. For example Brunton,
						Gurdjieff, Cagliostro, Nostradamus, --- all remarkable me, but I have only met one
						of them, Brunton, &amp; that only twice, <em>not enough to judge</em> because
						I was then a seeker, in a highly emotional state, and a student myself. What about
						D.T. Suzuki, Sri Aurobindo? I met Suzuki twice. I am <em>very suspicious</em> here
						because they turned out such a <em>big volume</em> of words &amp; theories. Zen
						Masters do not do that!
					</p>
					<p>
						Who would I regard as “awakened”? I think Krishnamurti, whom I have met, and the
						Maharshi, who has a down-to-earth common sense &amp; is reasonably brief &amp; to
						the point.
					</p>
					<p>
						(Plus thousands of unknowns!)
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						POSSIBLE <span style="font-size:20pt;">*</span> EXPLANATION WHY SOME MEN APPEAR <em>SO WISE</em><br /><br />
						Zen?
					</div>
					<p>
						Maybe I should say that there is an “intellectual” sort of “awakening” which produces
						a similar understanding &amp; lasts through life , which lacks SIMULTANEOUS direct
						contact and ability to experiment with (!!) the Entity which is the One.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Mystical experience” is unconscious or only partly conscious (&amp; leaves ego
						untouched!). The need is to have this wonderful but evasive and non-evidential thing
						SPREAD OUT FOR EXAMINATION IN THE FULLY CONSCIOUS MIND -- the one you use in your
						sceptical way (&amp; believe me I am far more ‘sceptical’ than you will ever be
						-- being a mathematician &amp; ex-public-accountant).
					</p>

					<p>
						You keep falling over one &amp; the same thing.
					</p>
					<p>
						You are looking in the South for the North star!
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="width:4rem;top:2rem;">
						“Rebirth” is the Oriental word.
					</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						To be specific. You “raise” questions as to life after death, “reincarnation” &amp;
						so forth. No answer to these has yet been furnished by experiment. That is the only
						way to get an “answer,” <em>if it is possible</em>. (God tantalizes you with “ultimates.”)
						However when you become “awakened” your whole understanding of concepts, the self,
						time, space, perception, etc. is DRASTICALLY OVERTURNED.
					</p>
					<p>
						This IN TURN powerfully affects the consideration of your “questions” (obviously
						an “after-life” for example IMPLIES that “time” goes on just as usual without your
						mind OR ELSE that mind itself survives -- and I doubt that!)
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus “questions” are ALL disposed of, <em>as mine have been</em>, and in the following
						ways:
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -10rem; width:9rem;top: 1rem;">
						<em>After awakening</em> &nbsp; one feels this quietly happening for maybe a year
						after satori. (“Maturing”<br /> we call it.)
					</div>
					<blockquote style="margin-left: 3rem;">
						<p class="item">
							(a) SOME are recognized as having no meaning in themselves &amp; thus as “no questions.”
						</p>
						<p class="item">
							(b) SOME <em>are</em> answered.
						</p>
						<p class="item">
							(c) SOME are seen to be incapable of any answer (since they are things to be ‘accepted,’
							like the One).
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-10rem;">
						<em>“INFORMATION”</em>?
					</div>
					<p>
						You are AHEAD OF YOURSELF. For a .04 stamp you wish to peep at the hidden records
						of the Universe!! Seriously you must <em>first</em> get “awakening” to deal adequately
						with some of your “questions” -- OTHERWISE THE ANSWERS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED
						LONG AGO IN THE NEWSPAPERS! EVER THINK OF THAT? WORDS CAN BE PRINTED.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-10rem;">
						<em>“TYPICAL “INFORMATION”</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						I note Brunton says Jesus <em>came from another planet</em>. This sort of “information”
						rings ALARM BELLS in me at once, -- &amp; involuntarily I say to myself “baloney,
						how does HE know?”
					</p>
					<p>
						“Reincarnation” is theosophy. In the East it is “rebirth” &amp; that involves <em>NO
							REAL CONNECTION</em> with you, only a continuation of “tendencies.” The “Perennial
						Philosophy” contains innumerable quotations from genuinely awakened men. Why “apologetic”?
					</p>
					<div class="rightoffset item" style="left: 41rem; top: -5rem; width: 12rem;">
						<p>
							&lt;-- R. had referred to Huxley’s writing style as “apologetic possibility.”<br /><br />
							&lt;-- R. had asked him if A. were an existentialist </p>
					</div>
					<p>
						I still don’t know for sure what an existentialist is. WHAT IS IT? Then I can say if I am one!! Has “awakening”
						<em>increased</em> my knowledge of “life after death”? Certainly -- but not as <em>this</em>
						“self.”
