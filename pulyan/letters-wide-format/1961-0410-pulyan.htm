						April 10, 1961
					</p>
					<p class="salutation">
						Dear Dick,
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						THIS IS “ME”<br />
						<em>SPEAKING</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Occasionally on the stage an actor will doff his “mask” &amp; disguises &amp; make-up
						&amp; appear as himself. It is sometimes a very different personality, in fact usually.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus in this letter I am <em>not</em> speaking as “one of the few” or somebody who
						claims to “know” about what you call “essence” and I call the “One Self.” I leave
						that to one side.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am just another human being in this letter and I trust you will find me agreeable
						&amp; courteous.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>UNKINDNESS</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						I think all of us humans should feel a deep sympathy for one another in this vale
						of tears. Thus any “caustic sarcasm” you may have found in any of my previous letters
						<em>I deeply regret</em> (<em>from the point of view of this letter</em>). Also
						the “vulgar choice of words” that you observed, and the possible “adolescent desire
						to shock.” Also I regret any “nagging” you may have noticed. All such things are
						merely adding fresh disagreeableness to the ample supply that exists anyway.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="top:0;">
						LEAVING WITH<br />
						<em>A DIRTY LOOK</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						The few cases that I have had where a person withdrew <em>were all characterized by
							more or less acerbity</em> &amp; I think this is due to a misunderstanding. Let
						me illustrate.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="width:12rem;">
						<em>THE TECHNIQUE</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						A young girl student of Zen was walking along Sixth Avenue, New York, when a “drunk”
						decided to give her a scare. He shouted out something as loud as he could, “BOO!!”
						The girl smiled as it reminded her of the Zen Master. The drunk said, “Christ, she
						LIKES it!!!”
					</p>
					<p>
						You remember the character in the Mikado, who was unable to find anybody to contradict
						him? Everybody was too darn nice!
					</p>
					<p>
						The person who is “awakened” understands that the only way to such an attainment
						is AGAINST EGO. That means that the guru, or whatever you call him, has to be constantly
						throwing barbs, harpoons -- being disagreeable, sarcastic, <em>unreasonable</em>,
						vulgar, adolescent, nagging, caustic &amp; so forth. It is his job as it is the
						job of the architect to design buildings.

					<div class="leftoffset" style="width:14rem;">
						A THANKLESS<br />
						<em>TASK</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Obviously it is <em>a thankless task</em>. He does not, I assure you, enjoy his
						rôle in life but, like a surgeon, he has <em>a job to do</em>. The results are beyond
						glory &amp; beyond all imagination &amp; any little temporary inconvenience is negligible
						or should be.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						KICKING THE<br />
						<em>SURGEON</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						But it is surprising how the slightest touch on our ego (&amp; now that includes
						mine too of course) makes us flare up, get resentful &amp; so forth. We assume there
						is, AS IS USUAL IN THIS WORLD, no love behind the barbed insult but <em class="double">
							forget</em> that IN THE CASE OF THE GURU (and MY GURU TOO!) there is all the
						Love in the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						We <em>mix up</em> quarreling &amp; nagging (so familiar in marital life &amp;
						daily life) with the guru’s technique.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-9rem;">
						FIND ANOTHER ONE OR DROP THE WHOLE MISERABLE<br />
						<em>BUSINESS</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						Now the poor guru doesn’t <em>want</em> to keep up this stream of unreasonable invective
						but it is the only way if results are to be achieved (ego <em>must</em> be desensitized).
						So if the pupil screeches loudly enough the guru <em>happily</em>* gives up the
						whole horrible business &amp; is <em>only too glad</em>* to get back on a mutually
						agreeable basis, where friends (as the world understands that word) can interchange
						pleasant discussions about ultimate problems.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						(* sadness too because another person has failed to see what was being aimed at,
						i.e. has “missed the mark”)
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						MAKE UP<br /><em>YOUR MIND</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						If you regard the whole business as being nonsensical and leading nowhere, &amp;
						you are entitled you your point of view, then obviously the so-called guru is merely
						<em>a disagreeable old bastard having a crude kind of fun with the poor student</em>.
						From <em>your</em> point of view this is how I spend my life. Naturally from <em>my</em>
						point of view I think you have a caricature, because I can actually point to at
						least 70% of successes where the student was <em>too grateful for any words</em>
						&amp; fully <em>understood the means it was necessary to use</em> to bring him or
						her to a realization.

					<div class="leftoffset" style="top:0;">
						BATTLE AGAINST<br />OLE DEBBIL<br /><em>EGO!</em>
					</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						Even psychotherapy whose aim is more limited, &amp; whose goal is not so far off,
						has to go contra ego or self to some extent. However here the time is paid for so
						it is possible by spreading out the annoyance over a long, long period to make the
						mental disturbance seem much less. We had farther to go &amp; less time to do it
						in.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						SHADOW-<br />
						<em>BOXING</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						It is usual for an agreement to be reached so that although the guru &amp; student
						are fencing, boxing or what have you, yet they agree that whatever <em>injuries</em>
						are received (not really very serious one -- only to the self-esteem!) they will
						remain friends &amp; continue whatever happens. In this way Jacob wrestled with
						the Lord. Always their friendship is reaffirmed at the close of each letter.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						&nbsp;WHAT I
						<br />
						“<em>WANTED</em>”
					</div>
					<p>
						Naturally I wanted <em>more</em> than “a flow of correspondence” (especially when
						you refused to “argue” at times &amp; wrote only a couple of sentences).
					</p>
					<p class="item">
						(a) I did expect that you would appreciate my motives &amp; the necessity of this
						unfortunate technique (monks have to be dragged in to face the Zen Master sometimes
						-- when they cannot answer their “koans”). If the fencing or boxing turns into a
						grudge-fight then the cooler head will call a halt, even apologize if necessary
						&amp; politely avoid further occasions with the same person.
					</p>
					<p class="item">
						(b) I also expected that “friend” would gradually come <em>to mean something</em>
						so that together we could examine what you call our “diversity in the field of metaphysics”
						&amp; together make a reasonable decision about it. I must however protest against
						the word “metaphysics,” as what happened to many other students was not an understanding
						of “metaphysics,” but a conscious <em>experience</em> quite unlike anything
						else, that happens all by itself when we cease to oppose the current of life.

					<div class="leftoffset" style="width:5rem;">
						I DID ALL YOU ARE DOING<br />
						<em>NOW</em>
					</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						I will say that your present attitude is <em>no different</em> from that which I
						myself had to my own teacher or guru. (I wish I could avoid Indian terms as I am
						not concerned with Oriental metaphysics!)
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						I was <em>sullen, revengeful, spiteful, angry</em>, -- more so in fact than yourself
						-- even murderous &amp; we all have a touch of that in us.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						It seems now that to be so moved by insults to my precious “super ego” is the <em>most
							absurd thing in the world</em>. But let a waiter say to you in a whisper “Not
						that fork sir, use the other one” &amp; you “burn” slowly (even if it is a practical
						joke). <em>Self-esteem is awfully strong</em> .
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset">
						<em>YOUR NASTY MIND</em>
					</div>
					<p>
						With a student like yourself <em>IT IS YOUR INTERESTS SOLELY THAT ARE CONSIDERED</em>.
						(What do <em>I</em> gain by the time I spend on these letters? The <em>pleasure</em>
						of being “sarcastic”?? Hardly. That is <em>Dead-Sea fruit</em> &amp; a vain “pleasure”
						when I have enough to trouble me in the natural course of life without seeking you
						out as a butt for mere rudeness!) (Besides, you don’t have to take it you know.)
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left:-6rem;top:3rem;">
						<span style="display:inline-block;font-size: 22pt;text-align:right;">&rarr;</span>
					</div>
					<p>
						Thus: <em>you can call me caustic &amp; sarcastic (or far worse</em>) but when you
						add “<em class="double">that I consider unnecessary</em>” then I see that you are
						<em>not clear as to what we are doing</em>. If I were all sweetness &amp; light
						I somehow think it would not make much change in Richard! He can get that kind of
						<em>glucose</em> from <em>a thousand easy sources</em> (from the pulpit to the inspirational
						articles, books, pamphlets -- etc.).
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -9rem; width: 7rem;">
						YOU DO NOT THINK THAT “AWAKENING” MEANS
						<em>MUCH</em>
					</div>
					<p class="noindent">
						I am not really a louse, but you have somehow to learn to handle these “harpoons”
						&amp; not to regard it as a marital squabble. The <em>real trouble however</em>
						which makes our work so difficult is that you have <em>no actual belief</em> that
						there is any such experience (as I so often refer to as “awakening”) available to
						human beings. Thus it all seems useless to you.
