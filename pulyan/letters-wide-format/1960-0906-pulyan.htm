                        Dear Dick,
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="top:0.5rem;">
                        <em>COMMUNICATION</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This won’t do you know! (By the way how old are you?) What won’t do? Well, this
                        horsing about as to what I am, what I can do &amp; so on &amp; so on! “Your plans,”
                        “your system,” &amp; so on!!!<br />
                        If only we could get down to the absolute friendship I asked, then all this by-play
                        might be avoided. That <em>does</em> means plain speaking &amp; <em>not</em> “easing
                        into an acquaintanceship.”<br />
                        If you call me a lousy son-of-a-bitch, an authoritarian snob, a hopeless paranoiac
                        then <em>that is fine, excellent</em> -- but the <em>dribbling, hopeless, piddling
                            dialectic</em> you favor me with is <em>far more objectionable</em>. You may call
                        it polite &amp; think you are behaving yourself admirably, but it is <em>of no use in
                            our task</em>. I <em>have</em> got something -- all that man can get on this
                        earth most probably -- and my job &amp; your job is <em>to transfer it</em> from
                        me to you. O.K. Here is Alfred Ralph Pulyan -- <em>guinea-pig</em>. How are we to
                        <em>extract</em> it from him? It is otherwise called “<em>the transmission</em>.”
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset">
                        <em>DIALECTICS?</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Now <em>in order to get you out of this weary, dreary back-and-forth</em>, naturally
                        I try to find your reaction &amp; to get you to express it, I also relate my experiences
                        with others, &amp; so forth -- all so as to throw enough stuff so that you will
                        <em>get an inkling</em> of the position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do <em>not</em> of course betray confidences or names but I do speak “generally”
                        as here.
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="left: -5rem;">
                        (1)
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        For example today I got a letter from a man who says he began to “pierce the darkness”
                        about a year ago &amp; says truth is in Zen, Buddhism, Theosophy, Rosicrucianism,
                        Quabalah etc. &amp; wants to teach me. He says I doubt my own capabilities &amp;
                        no doubt I will never meet “a truly awakened one.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Question</em> -- can I do anything here? (We never really know.) Well. To debase
                        and debauch the wonder I know so well is impossible, yet I cannot say straight out
                        to him: “I <em>am</em> one of these truly awakened ones,” although I can imagine
                        ways
                        <!-- -->
                        <!-- end page 1 of letter, page 11 of scan -->
                        <!-- start page  2 of letter, page 12 of scan -->
                        <!-- -->
                        in which I could have more of what I have. I have met quite a number of “truly awakened”
                        ones, but never so advanced as my own teacher who lives near me &amp; is as unknown
                        as any of us here. The Buddha, Gautama missed much of the physical side for example
                        &amp; even Zen does not stress it (although the Zen Masters I have met had splendidly
                        flexible bodies &amp; quick reflexes). Any evidence of “pride” or “superiority”
                        of course damns the person at once -- the Master’s “authority” is <em>lent</em>
                        to him by the student FOR A PURPOSE, it is delegated, it is <em>not welcome</em>
                        to the Master who earnestly hopes for the day the monk will dig him in the ribs
                        &amp; they will converse arm in arm <em>about other things</em> . It is a surgeon’s
                        job, but more thankless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now as to this case. Mention of particularly “occult” societies is a warning signal.
                        I have not met a person “awakened” by some of these, although numbers of people
                        DO get a sort of mental awakening wherein they see the “oneness” of things. It is
                        good -- but it is the cake without the icing, they do not know the One <em>as you and
                            I could know one another</em>. <em>Nothing less</em> will do!! Note my exact
                        words. They are those of DeGama in 1540 &amp; of Jesus in AD30 -- or indeed of any
                        “truly awakened” person. Some correspondents say they are spending their lives in
                        a search for “St. Germain”!!!!! O.K. They will sooner find--- (but invent your own
                        simile). Others say they are Adepts of the Fifth Ray &amp; Masters of the Spheres.
                        (And so compensate for a depressing life!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I ask him who his teacher was, but have little hope here.
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="left: -5rem;">
                        (2)
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        A maiden lady believing everything can be done through deliberate ESP. Says she
                        know cases where people do it in business for a good living. Says mystical glimpses
                        give people no right to be authorities. Etc. etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The word “authority” is based on the idea of <em>learning</em> things as in astronomy,
                        engineering, etc. etc--- &amp; the “mystical glimpses” is a tricky way of referring
                        to satori which is SOMETHING QUITE OTHERWISE. The “glimpse” is feeling, satori is
                        knowledge &amp; more -- ESP is a “do-it-yourself” technique &amp; in any case is
                        ego’s way of bloating himself as big as an ox to try to <em>be</em> something. No
                        hope of “getting there” by heightened perceptions or ESP -- it must be by awareness
                        OF awareness, <em>not awareness of thoughts &amp; things</em>. It is characteristic
                        evasion &amp; under pressure she will try every trick in the book &amp; a flood
                        of dialectics. She wants a boy friend!

                        A letter from somebody called Richard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        Seems a nice enough fellow, crazy, anxious on the one hand not to frighten me away
                        &amp; on the other pretty blah, blah.
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        Tells me “I must know a lot more about you.” Momentary feeling is “go and f--- yourself.
                        What do you expect for .04?” [a stamp] &amp; then I say, “<em>Down Fido</em>!
                        After all he is <em>entitled</em> to be a sceptic. You were one yourself, Alfred,
                        &amp; how!”
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="left:-12rem; top:-3rem; width: 9rem;">
                        <span style="display:inline-block;font-size: 22pt;text-align:right;">&rarr;</span><br />
                        I was a lulu all right -- far more of a smart aleck than you, indeed poisonous.
                        Yet my friend did the job. Glory, hallelujah! I really didn’t deserve it. So why
                        should I get proud? But it is an effort!
                    </div>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        Wants to know what happens if body &amp; mind disappear?
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        Answer -- you will be dead, my bucko, as you will discover one day! Why do they
                        say such stoopid things? Oh well, maybe he had better come &amp; see me one day
                        -- not for “work” -- but to see that body &amp; mind are still around!! (Make an
                        appointment first -- &amp; not yet awhile.) Mail work is as good as personal work
                        -- probably better.
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        Evidently Richard is a bit on the occult or magical side -- what the hell do they
                        expect -- levitation? The real magic which is a complete reversal of everything
                        never occurs to these numskulls. As for “we are equal” this may be false <em>in one
                            way</em>. People vary in “accessibility.” Some attain in 30 minutes, others
                        take year of backbreaking &amp; heartbreaking “work.” But Richard wants to go to
                        the “heart of things.” He is probably going -- nowhere.
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        “Your system” he keeps saying! “Your system”!! I sell nothing, &amp; <em>everything is
                            spontaneous</em>. In Zen it is not the koan but another &amp; more personal factor
                        that does the trick. Meditation is a device to keep the boys out of mischief for
                        awhile. (P.S. It doesn’t succeed nowadays. They set out &amp; have big feasts &amp;
                        go after the chicks with the slanted eyes.)

                        It is <em>his whole life, his whole health &amp; happiness</em> &amp; the God-forsaken
                        idiot is going to <em>throw it away</em> by ungenerous, piddling, unfriendly,
                        ... communications. I could be sad if it wasn’t happening all the time. Evidently
                        doesn’t trust his friend Mac (if he <em>is</em> a friend) &amp; is of a grudging,
                        constipated mentality incapable of much fine feeling or “greatness.” Some seed fell
                        on good ground, some on stony soil, some by the wayside --
                    </p>
                    <p class="noindent">
                        What will happen? <em>Doubtful</em>. He <em>could</em> “get there” but he is still
                        going around “judging” &amp; “deciding.” Since the essence of our work is to <em>abandon</em>
                        this final line of defense of the ego where can the change occur? What do I (ARP)
                        matter? If I were Oral Roberts, Walt Disney or a bum hopping freights it is all
                        the same. Our aim is NOT the “accidentals.” We shall see.

                        A “Scientologist.” He has a “spirit” that has lived for 74 trillion years &amp;
                        has 2 trillion to go (on the “average” -- what average?). During this time he “plays

                        You want a process that “enhances.” What does that mean -- gives you joy &amp; pleasure.

                        From my side however I am undertaking a long &amp; difficult job which will add
                        to my gray hairs. I am taking a bright child almost, still green behind the ears,
                        and trying to show something of deep -- what shall I say of the highest feelings?
                        -- “culture” maybe, but all words are wrong of course. Anyway the current cynicism
                        &amp; world weariness is no use here. You must <em>somehow</em> pitch yourself
                        pretty high before this comes to you. You may deceive or cajole me, but not God.

                        other similar work entirely &amp; not read any books on this general subject (unless
                        I happen to suggest one). Also send me a stamped addressed envelope. It will be
                        unpleasant, frustrating, disagreeable, annoying--- (so is growing up anyway). Afterwards
                        you will be a human being &amp; understand many things.

                        doubt, but which from my <em>present</em> point of view is unthinkable. Nevertheless
                        we can part in the most friendly manner &amp; nothing has been lost.

                        BIPOLAR <em>MIND</em>

                    <p class="noindent">
                        “Personality” which derives its characteristic “flavor” from <em>memory</em> content
                        (both mental &amp; physical “memories” or “habits”) -- AND WHICH IS THEREFORE LARGELY
                        “ACCIDENTAL” -- is not the part of you we have to work with, nor the part of me
                        that works with you. However we have to use words &amp; we have to pass through
                        the mind of course. Now the mind like everything in this world of ours is strictly
                        bipolar, dual. An obvious doublet is good-bad. (There are thousands upon thousands
                        since the mind <em>splits</em> everything It is the way of reasoning, the YES-NO
                        method. Light-dark, few-many, up-down, long-short, being-nonbeing, something-nothing,
                        <span class="nowrap">wise-foolish ..... )</span> Thus it is idle to hope to “improve”
                        personality since the side we show implies the side we suppress. However we <em>can</em>
                        decide not to put any more disgusting junk into our memory-box, there is sufficient
                        already.

                        <em>Consciousness or awareness is pure</em> but mixed up with (normally) some
                        thought or perception (yoga tries to free it, but it is actually the ego trying
                        to free the ego &amp; it leads maybe to a “feeling” experience but not to “knowledge”).

                    <p>
                        We must accept our dual nature, like the vine winding round the tree.

                        If the student gets <em>“caught” in personality</em> (nothing unusual in a world
                        where it is happening all day long -- every word is weighed to see if it is a “slight”
                        or an ego-bruise) then he will start (or try to start) an old-fashioned <em>interminable</em>
                        argument (“You were being needlessly rude,” “I didn’t mean it the way you
                        think,” “I want to be helped up not knocked down,” “You are a fine one to talk of
                        ego, you have an interesting amount yourself,” “I want to learn something, not to
                        have everything questioned,” “Can’t we get together somehow?” “Communication is
                        breaking down”) -- almost connubial (but not so snide!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actually this is all very silly &amp; is avoided even in business circles where
                        “everything goes,” if it is said with a smile, e.g. “You old crook!” Ego is very
                        <em>sensitive</em> to words (e.g. if the waiter says “Not that fork, Sir”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But when ego is <em>really</em> threatened -- then take cover --- the place will
                        be in shambles.

                        No wonder so few attain to “life.” (And so many use push-button or <em>internal</em>
                        methods like magic, occultism, etc. etc. where one deceives oneself as long
                        as possible in wild [end of sentence not readable].
