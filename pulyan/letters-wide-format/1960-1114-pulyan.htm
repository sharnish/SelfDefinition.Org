					<p class="salutation">
						Dear Dick,
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Forget about me for the sake of argument for the moment. Take a Zen Master.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -5rem; width: 5rem; top:1.2rem;">
						<em>ZEN</em>
					</div>

					<p class="indent">
						Sokatsu Shaku on his seventieth birthday (April 16, 1939) said that in his <em>40</em>
						years of teaching <em>3,000</em> men &amp; women came to study Zen. In
						the 40 years only <em>13</em> completed the training &amp; of these only 4 became
						teachers in turn.
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						These 4 were Zuizan Goto, Eisan Tatsuta, Chikudo Ohasama and Sokei-An (who “worked”
						in New York &amp; founded “The First Zen Institute” which still exists -- the Zen
						Master there now is Miura Roshi).
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						These 4 men were remarkable men. I know several persons who knew <em>Sokei-An</em>
						(See “Cat’s Yawn,” fairly easily obtainable -- a reprint of issues of a magazine
						published by &amp; written by Sokei-An).<sup>1</sup>
					</p>

					<div class="rightoffset" style="top:-10rem;">
						<sup>1</sup><br />
						Footnoted on letter of Sep 23, 1960, in the appendix
						<a href="1960-0923-pulyan.htm#personality-of-the-master">
							Personality of the Master</a> (on right side, scroll down from the linked section).
					</div>

					<p class="indent">
						As for Chikudo <em>Ohasama</em> (who studied also at Heidelberg) a friend of mine
						(an “awakened” man) “worked” in Berlin with Ohasama.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -6rem; width: 6rem; top:1.2rem;">
						<em>PROOF</em>
					</div>
					<p class="indent">
						NOW! What “proof” could any of these Zen Masters give you? <em class="double">What would
							you accept as “proof”</em>?
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						If Jesus called on you one day <em class="double">what would you require as “proof”</em>?
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						If two spies met in the old Nazi Germany (the “Third Reich” of Hitler) &amp; each
						<em>told</em> the other they were working for the “allies” (US, England etc.) what
						<em>proof</em> could they give one another? All documents would mean <span class="nowrap">
							nothing ---</span> <em>HOW</em> could they get together?
					</p>

					</div>
					<p class="indent">
						<!-- [Arrow in left margin pointing to the beginning of this paragraph.] -->
						What proof could <em>anyone</em> give of something that was a personal experience?
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						After Jesus was supposed to feed 5,000 with 5 loaves of bread &amp; 2 fishes, the
						religious leaders asked him for <em>a “sign</em>”. Wow! What did they want? More?
						Red, white &amp; blue rays from every pore like poor Gautama??<br />

						It is <em>not</em> a matter of “ignorance” &amp; “authority.”</p>
					<p>
						I am <em>imposing</em> nothing on you &amp; expect nothing of you.</p>
					<!-- [Arrow in left margin pointing to the following sentence:] -->
					<p>
						But you wrote me &amp; I have no earthly way of knowing what you desire as proof?
						<span style="display:inline-block;font-size: 22pt;text-align:right;">&rarr;</span>
						<em>You never tell me.</em>

						The “Supreme Court” has established <em>clear rules of evidence</em>&amp; in law
						what is admissible &amp; what is not admissible is clearly codified.
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -6rem; width: 5rem; top:1.2rem;">
						<em>"SAID"</em>?
					</div>
					<p class="indent">
						But you wait to hear ANYTHING WHATEVER that is <em class="double">said</em> &amp;
						automatically (&amp; correctly) reply “nyet” (NO!). “Doubt” in you is <em>more</em>
						than scepticism. It is a “quest.”
					</p>
					<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -6rem; width: 5rem; top:1.2rem;">
						<em>"DONE"</em>?
					</div>
					<p class="indent" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
						Then if you see something <em class="double">done</em> what is that to you? Is
						that what you want? Miracles? Wonders? “Signs”?
					</p>

					<blockquote style="margin-top: 0;">
						<p class="noindent">
							A little levitation?
							<br />
							One of my letters appearing under your plate without coming through the mails?<br />
							A vision?
							<br />
							WHAT?
						</p>

						<div class="leftoffset" style="left: -8rem; width: 6rem; top: 1.3rem;">

							What would you regard as “proof”?

						Please include a stamped addressed envelope. A mere psychotherapist who talks to
						you for 5 years (or you to him) may cost <em>$6,500 or more</em> (say $25 a week).
						So .04 is still cheap &amp; I don’t get it as <em>revenue</em>. Uncle Sam gets it.

						If it isn’t worth <em>that</em> to you then the thing for you to do is <em>obvious.</em>

						like a human being.
