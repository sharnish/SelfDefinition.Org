							One who “should” know whether he has had past lives.
							<br />
							One who “should” be able to push Richard over.

						“SHALL I GIVE YOU HONESTY WHILE YOU TOY WITH EVASIVENESS?”
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						To “<em>toy with evasiveness</em>” implies a degree of conscious deception. Now
						this might be some technique of “working” &amp; so I might be entitled to it in
						view of the greater good. However I have <em>not</em> done any such thing &amp;
						the trouble lies in the fact that there is indeed <em>no way whatever</em> of “conveying”
						the experience.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						A good thing!
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						Why?
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						Because anything “explainable” would be liable to counterattack in WORDS &amp; fortunately
						this <em class="double">is</em> “experience” (as real as a <em>color</em> or a
						<em>sound</em>) &amp; so standing on its own feet &amp; not verbalizable.

						I am NOT “trying to verbalize something.” The meter I would observe
						<!-- a drawing of a clock-like face with a hand pointing to the marker at 2 o’clock-->
						is NOT “degree of understanding or learning” but something between the lines,
						which is my real concern.
					</p>
					<p>
						<!--  a similar dial with the pointer almost to 12 o’clock-->
						Until that goes round

						the rule is KEEP TALKING, even recite “Mary had a little lamb” (&amp; in letters
						“keep writing”) since blank sheets of paper are not enough.
					</p>
					<p>
						My words “housebroken” &amp; so forth are not mere abuse, but if you will observe
						refer to <em>fundamental changes in a person</em>, maturity, softening up, humanity
						etc. ...
					</p>
					<p>
						Take an underprivileged kid &amp; try to explain why he mustn’t spit on the carpet
						&amp; at first he will say “what the hell does it matter?” Later things may seem

						Abraham Lincoln on April 13, 1865 had a quasi-dream in which he saw that individuality
						was a mere difference in brain-folds. An identical force was speaking through Grant
						and Lincoln, Jefferson Davis &amp; Robert E. Lee &amp; old John Brown.
					</p>
					<p>
						A mighty conscious creative entity as subtle and all pervasive as electricity, but
						possessed of every capacity men’s souls and minds possessed: an entity which manifested
						itself through all forms of life. If so why? To what end?
					</p>
					<p>
						If the law of heredity produced Jeff Davis &amp; Lincoln and a slave trader, did
						it mean that the force deliberately limited by a good or bad or inadequate brain,
						its own spiritual expression?
					</p>
					<p>
						By the eternal verities, it looked as if this were true.
					</p>
					<p>
						It looked as if existence were a stupendously earnest game in which the creator
						had set himself the task of bringing all life to vivid consciousness of its complete
						identity with him.
					</p>
					<p>
						And when as the aeons rolled, man became completely conscious that his soul and
						the creator’s were one and the same .... Lincoln covered his eyes with his hand
						....
					</p>
					<p>
						This call, heard with his spiritual ear: what was it but the wakening knowledge
						that he was not Abraham Lincoln -- save for this moment of existence. Actually he
						was one with all life forever. The call, did it not mean that that larger segment
						of himself which dwelt far, far beyond the outposts of human thought, was putting
						itself in communion with that infinitesimal segment known as
						<!-- -->

						<!-- start of page 7 of letter, sheet number 88 -->
						<!-- -->
						Abraham Lincoln: telling Lincoln that all was well.
					</p>
					<p>
						... And with an increasing wonder he realized that for the first time <em>since conscious
							thought began with him</em>, he was not lonely. Never to be lonely again! That
						which was imprisoned in the poor frame of Abraham Lincoln had envisaged its real
						identity, had sighted its true home.
					</p>
					<p>
						Happiness! This, then was happiness! -- Its other name was God.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 5rem;">
						(from “Great Captain,” Honoré Morrow)
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						Next day he was assassinated. But he had told his wife, had told Stanton ...
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
					</p>
					<p>
						Is it happiness or a bitter-sweet joy? What words can we choose? (The bitterness
						of maturity, the sweetness of a child.) Words refer to things we have known. Here
						is something comparable to an animal becoming a man -- what words for such a change?
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						“Animal becoming a man” say R. “How wild can your comparisons get?” Let us see.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						Experiments have shown that to a certain age animals outstrip human children. But
						<em>children develop self-consciousness</em> &amp; that is an overwhelming change.
						Do they learn this; study to do this?
					</p>
					<p>
						No. Not formally, anyway. But they <em>learn a language</em> &amp; that is a powerful
						weapon, fashioned by self-conscious people, full of such concepts -- even the words
						“self-conscious” .... Further they <em>observe &amp; copy</em> available adults
						.... One day the world is seen with new eyes &amp; the child may think it has a
						unique faculty. This is soon corrected by experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						It would seem to be easier to take the next step, to <em class="double">S</em>elf
						<em class="double">C</em>onsciousness. We have a language skill, we have some feeling
						of “Self.” It is true that <em>until it occurs to us we can not know it</em>. But
						it was the same with self-consciousness, &amp; besides there are a number of people
						who assure us it happened to them and that it is an “experience” or rather a sudden
						change in consciousness (like “seeing a joke” perhaps).
					</p>
					<p>
						But we jib. We say it is a false analogy, there is no such thing, it does not happen.
						But we cover ourselves by adding, “if something happens it means nothing and is
						of no importance.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Our friends who are “awakened” say, “since you have little to lose except a few
						minutes now &amp; then, &amp; everything to gain -- truly ‘Everything’ -- then isn’t
						it a good gamble?”
						<!-- -->
						<!-- end of page 7 of letter, sheet number 88 -->
						<!-- start of page 8 (and last) of letter, sheet number 89 -->
						<!-- -->
						But we really <em>fear</em> to go on with this &amp; so we just go on arguing. First
						we say, what are the techniques? Well in a way the same as for “self-consciousness”
						i.e. using the language &amp; observation of the guru (who is “adult” compared with
						you). But there is obviously more than that. We must exceed the “self”-concept,
						<em>not remove it</em> because it is the essence of a human-being, but we must surrender
						it so that the <em class="double">S</em>elf can come in. This we cannot usually
						do by ourselves.
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						<em>Consider the other side of the question</em>!
					</p>
					<p class="noindent">
						The guru is willing to give all his time &amp; best efforts to help the student
						without hope of reward or even thanks. He expects every kind of ingratitude, slippery
						business, ... and gray hairs. He expects the student to argue, argue indefinitely
						even though that produces no experiences. He finds the student wants to direct the
						procedure to some extent, to know all the methods, what is being done &amp; so forth
						(even if it makes it impossible to help him to realization!). He finds the student
						is just an “Indian-receiver” criticizing everything in great detail &amp; wanting
						everything done as comfortably as possible until finally his guru gently takes him
						in a plush-lined wheelbarrow &amp; dumps him in the Seventh Heaven, which he goggles
						at with a furred tongue and a lackadaisical eye ... Or perhaps he has a push-button
						mechanism installed ...
					</p>
					<p>
						After all, with so many advertisers &amp; sects competing for him, should he not get
						a bit choosy?
					</p>
					<p>
						The guru is sympathetic &amp; not sadistic by nature, indeed he knows what is going
						on (&amp; alas -- what will go on) &amp; so he does his best. <em>But the One stays
							away ...</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						You can fool the guru (perhaps), bully the guru, placate the guru, bamboozle him
						... but apparently not the One Self. Oh well, very annoying, try again ... (“How
						does the One penetrate my insincerity?” Not too difficult is it?)
