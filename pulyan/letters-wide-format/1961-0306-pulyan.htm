                        Dear Dick,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Conversational fodder” is apparently the best we can hope for yet. Actually a paucity
                        of language such as yours does not reflect a difficulty of finding something to
                        say, but rather show <em>a very high degree of selectivity</em> among your no-doubt
                        very numerous thoughts. You hand out to me the fewest possible scraps conveying
                        the fewest possible indications as to you yourself. If I were a psychoanalyst (&amp;
                        I certainly am not) getting $25 or $30 per hour for your revelations I feel you
                        might eventually feel that more cooperation would mean more money’s worth. Yet no
                        doubt many patients lie on the much publicized couch and mum for session after session,
                        and to hell with economy!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If two people getting married asked “What shall we talk about?” I should notify
                        any lawyer friend I had who handles divorce work to keep an eye on them!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Normally the procedure toward “awakening” goes something like this:
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="width: 8em;">                   
                        <em>STAGE (1)</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Battered by the storms of life or driven by an interior compulsion
                        or even some “experience” a person becomes dissatisfied with his or her current
                        religion (or the lack of it), and drifts and studies such things as Unity, Theosophy,
                        Christian Science, maybe even Rosicrucianism, Zen, etc. Possibly they will read
                        Huxley’s “Perennial Philosophy” &amp; dip into Far Eastern texts now so easily available.
                        They may get the idea that there is a thing called liberation or awakening or satori
                        or realization, although it seems extremely vague and their passion for miracles
                        &amp; marvels gets mixed up with it.
                    </p>
                    <div class="leftoffset" style="width: 8em;">                   
                        <em>STAGE (2)</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Sooner or later the “master-” or “guru-” idea comes up since
                        the student gets nowhere by himself or herself usually. To “pick” a master or guru,
                        cold turkey, is not at all easy because there are not enough available for picking
                        &amp; choosing. However there are the correspondence courses, the Essene Society,
                        the Brotherhood of Light, etc. etc. (I make up names although I may have guessed
                        <!-- -->
                        <!-- end page 1 of letter, page 95 of pdf -->
                        <!-- start page 2 of letter, page 96 of pdf -->
                        <!-- -->
                        an actual name -- it does not matter.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I often wonder whether some of these are not genuine &amp; could actually do the
                        job! However, the attention one gets, needs to be <em>far more individualized
                                &amp; personal</em> because this is not “learning,” it is partly a transmission
                        through friendship or love. One does not usually <em>sell</em> <em>these</em> things.
                        Then there are the Swamis of the Vedanta Society, very well educated &amp; high-toned
                        men indeed &amp; they conduct yoga classes. There is a Zen master in New York at
                        the First Zen Institute. Here we touch more satisfactory gurus. The question of
                        “how long” each of these takes is to be considered &amp; of course these do NOT
                        “work” <em>by mail</em>. Is there any genuine guru who does?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The student may not meet by good luck (if that is the proper word) a master, such
                        as a rare one in the Taoist succession or some other kind. (There are people in USA
                        belonging to NO sect, cult or religion who “work” as I do, suiting my vocabulary
                        to the student’s habits. Again, few work <em>by mail</em> if any.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The student by now is <em>getting a good idea</em> (even though he is not “awakened”)
                        of what he wants &amp; how to judge. Remember I am speaking of personal interviews.
                        He may drift from guru to guru (all good) until he reaches one that really suits
                        him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile it is assumed that the student has gradually become more &amp; more familiar
                        with the “Perennial Philosophy” or “Wisdom Religion” (or whatever term you use to
                        describe what Honoré Morrow puts into the mouth &amp; mind of her character Lincoln).
                        It becomes clear that “awakening” consists of realizing that we have come from &amp;
                        return to this One Self (to speak crudely perhaps). <em>At this stage</em> the student
                        is said to “dip one toe in the ocean,” i.e. to accept the general theory or doctrine
                        and be ready to accept “work.”
                    </p>

                        <em>STAGE (3)</em>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I do not wish to go into the whole technique of work with a guru but one thing is
                        clear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The student realizes that “awakening” or “realization” will never come unless at
                        least once the student has surrendered the “boss-concept” of ego or self, the idea
                        that it is a Supreme Court in itself, self-sufficient, “Captain of My Soul” (as
                        Henley boasts &amp; poor Bertrand Russell squeaks after him) ---
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the student is seeking to realize “that” to which he is subordinate, second-in-command,
                        it is obvious he must lower his flag, admit his lower status, at some time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is extremely easy for one person even like you to hold the great “God” (so-called)
                        of the Universe AWAY. <em>One little finger suffices</em>. Even a penny can hide the
                        Sun. Thus without your active cooperation, &amp; agreement to do as your guru says,
                        there is not even a ghost of a chance of realization. If the student wishes to “win”
                        he should not be a student because it is <em>hard enough</em> when both guru and student
                        are eagerly cooperating! Such a “win” is a Pyrrhic victory -- 
                        it is <em>far too easy</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus in Japan the applicant must wait outside the gates of the monastery a day or
                        so. It is done rather symbolically now -- once it was very real &amp; the applicant
                        was repulsed, treated roughly, told to go away &amp; the gate slammed in his face.
                    </p>

                        But nowadays with Ipana toothpaste with Hexa-Hexa-Hexachlorophene &amp; innumerable
                        detergents competing over TV little Richard wants to be wooed, gently persuaded, urged
                        to enter -- and the $1,000,000 bill must be washed &amp; ironed &amp; handed over
                        on a silken cushion before he will accept it.

                        Fortunately some have said to me “Light a Fire under me.” Some have said “My daughter
                        says my face has changed.” And so on &amp; so on, but I will give you no testimonials

                        that you should not have one!” So “how will you know your guru?” If you ask that,
                        you will never know --- in fact the whole subject is not very pressing to you now.

                        Some people have <em>strong visualizing abilities</em>, some can “<em>imagine” sounds</em>
                        very well. Some go further &amp; have hallucinations or delusions. These are interesting
                        faculties &amp; can even be annoying if excessive. They are dealt with in numerous
                        books &amp; articles everywhere, as in “Search” up to “To Morrow.” “Search” dealt
                        with such “sounds” recently. If you are <em>not</em> telling me that you <em>have</em>
                        such “voices” why not tell me straightforwardly?

                        However “awakening” or satori or realization of God is like seeing a joke, or jumping
                        to an explanation, and nothing involving the senses occurs at that time -- at least
                        <em>not in the way you mean</em>!

                        Why is it “important to spread the knowledge of <em>oblivion</em>
                        ”? It may not be <em>oblivion</em> as you say, but those who surrender the boss-concept
                        of ego may have experiences in which ego desires nothing so much as to EXIT.

                        made a dent in unending time!) &amp; seeks an EXIT may be frustrated, since to kill
                        the body, or commit suicide, according to current beliefs only starts him off on
                        the wrong foot in the next world. Thus 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
