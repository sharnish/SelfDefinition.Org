                    <p>
                        It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement.
                        This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It
                        is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to this website as
                        straightforward as possible, while reducing the number of notices that we receive
                        that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        IMPORTANT: Misrepresentations made in your notice regarding whether material or
                        activity is infringing may expose you to liability for damages (including costs
                        and attorneys' fees). Courts have found that you must consider copyright defenses,
                        limitations or exceptions such as FAIR USE before sending a notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>See Fair Use discussion here: <a href="https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use.html">
