										<p>
											The evolution of the present age&mdash;The great changes in civilisation are the consequence of changes in National thought&mdash;Modern belief in the power of crowds&mdash;It transforms the traditional policy of the European states&mdash;How the rise of the popular classes comes about, and the manner in which they exercise their power&mdash;The necessary consequences of the power of the crowd&mdash;Crowds unable to play a part other than destructive&mdash;The dissolution of worn-out civilisations is the work of the crowd&mdash;General ignorance of the psychology of crowds&mdash;Importance of the study of crowds for legislators and statesmen.

									<li class="link"><a class="toowide" href="1-1-general.htm">1. General Characteristics of Crowds – Psychological Law of Their Mental Unity </a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											What constitutes a crowd from the psychological point of view&mdash;A numerically strong agglomeration of individuals does not suffice to form a crowd&mdash;Special characteristics of psychological crowds&mdash;The turning in a fixed direction of the ideas and sentiments of individuals composing such a crowd, and the disappearance of their personality&mdash;The crowd is always dominated by considerations of which it is unconscious&mdash;The disappearance of brain activity and the predominance of medullar activity&mdash;The lowering of the intelligence and the complete transformation of the sentiments&mdash;The transformed sentiments may be better or worse than those of the individuals of which the crowd is composed&mdash;A crowd is as easily heroic as criminal.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="link"><a href="1-2-sentiments-and-morality.htm">2. The Sentiments and Morality of Crowds </a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											1. IMPULSIVENESS, MOBILITY, AND IRRITABILITY OF CROWDS. The crowd is at the mercy of all exterior exciting causes, and reflects their incessant variations&mdash;The impulses which the crowd obeys are so imperious as to annihilate the feeling of personal interest&mdash;Premeditation is absent from crowds&mdash;Racial influence.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. CROWDS ARE CREDULOUS AND READILY INFLUENCED BY SUGGESTION. The obedience of crowds to suggestions&mdash;The images evoked in the mind of crowds are accepted by them as realities&mdash;Why these images are identical for all the individuals composing a crowd&mdash;The equality of the educated and the ignorant man in a crowd&mdash;Various examples of the illusions to which the individuals in a crowd are subject&mdash;The impossibility of according belief to the testimony of crowds&mdash;The unanimity of numerous witnesses is one of the worst proofs that can be invoked to establish a fact&mdash;The slight value of works of history.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. THE EXAGGERATION AND INGENUOUSNESS OF THE SENTIMENTS OF CROWDS. Crowds do not admit doubt or uncertainty, and always go to extremes&mdash;Their sentiments always excessive.
										</p>
										<p>
											4. THE INTOLERANCE, DICTATORIALNESS, AND CONSERVATISM OF CROWDS. The reasons of these sentiments&mdash;The servility of crowds in the face of a strong authority&mdash;The momentary revolutionary instincts of crowds do not prevent them from being extremely conservative&mdash;Crowds instinctively hostile to changes and progress.
										</p>
										<p>
											5. THE MORALITY OF CROWDS. The morality of crowds, according to the suggestions under which they act, may be much lower or much higher than that of the individuals composing them&mdash;Explanation and examples&mdash;Crowds rarely guided by those considerations of interest which are most often the exclusive motives of the isolated individual&mdash;The moralising role of crowds.

									<li class="link"><a class="toowide" href="1-3-ideas-reasoning.htm">3. The Ideas, Reasoning Power, and Imagination <span class="nowrap">of Crowds</span> </a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											1. Fundamental and accessory ideas&mdash;How contradictory ideas may exist simultaneously&mdash;The transformation that must be undergone by lofty ideas before they are accessible to crowds&mdash;The social influence of ideas is independent of the degree of truth they may contain.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. THE REASONING POWER OF CROWDS. Crowds are not to be influenced by reasoning&mdash;The reasoning of crowds is always of a very inferior order&mdash;There is only the appearance of analogy or succession in the ideas they associate.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. THE IMAGINATION OF CROWDS. Strength of the imagination of crowds&mdash;Crowds think in images, and these images succeed each other without any connecting link&mdash;Crowds are especially impressed by the marvellous&mdash;Legends and the marvellous are the real pillars of civilisation&mdash;The popular imagination has always been the basis of the power of statesmen&mdash;The manner in which facts capable of striking the imagination of crowds present themselves for observation.
										</p>

									<li class="link"><a class="toowide" href="1-4-religious-convictions.htm">4. A Religious Shape Assumed by All the Convictions of Crowds </a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											What is meant by the religious sentiment&mdash;It is independent of the worship of a divinity&mdash;Its characteristics&mdash;The strength of convictions assuming a religious shape&mdash;Various examples&mdash;Popular gods have never disappeared&mdash;New forms under which they are revived&mdash;Religious forms of atheism&mdash;Importance of these notions from the historical point of view&mdash;The Reformation, Saint Bartholomew, the Terror, and all analogous events are the result of the religious sentiments of crowds and not of the will of isolated individuals.

									<li class="bookno">Book 2, The Opinions and Beliefs of Crowds</li>
									<li class="link"><a class="toowide" href="2-1-remote-factors.htm">1. Remote Factors of The Opinions and Beliefs of Crowds </a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											Preparatory factors of the beliefs of crowds&mdash;The origin of the beliefs of crowds is the consequence of a preliminary process of elaboration&mdash;Study of the different factors of these beliefs.
										</p>
										<p>
											1. RACE. The predominating influence it exercises&mdash;It represents the suggestions of ancestors.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. TRADITIONS. They are the synthesis of the soul of the race&mdash;Social importance of traditions&mdash;How, after having been necessary they become harmful&mdash;Crowds are the most obstinate maintainers of traditional ideas.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. TIME. It prepares in succession the establishment of beliefs and then their destruction. It is by the aid of this factor that order may proceed from chaos.
										</p>
										<p>
											4. POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS. Erroneous idea of their part&mdash;Their influence extremely weak&mdash;They are effects, not causes&mdash;Nations are incapable of choosing what appear to them the best institutions&mdash;Institutions are labels which shelter the most dissimilar things under the same title&mdash;How institutions may come to be created&mdash;Certain institutions theoretically bad, such as centralisation obligatory for certain nations.
										</p>
										<p>
											5. INSTITUTIONS AND EDUCATION. Falsity of prevalent ideas as to the influence of instruction on crowds&mdash;Statistical indications&mdash;Demoralising effect of Latin system of education&mdash;Part instruction might play&mdash;Examples furnished by various peoples.
										</p>

									<li class="link"><a class="toowide" href="2-2-immediate-factors.htm">2. The Immediate Factors of the Opinions of&nbsp;Crowds </a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											1. IMAGES, WORDS AND FORMULAE. The magical power of words and formulae&mdash;The power of words bound up with the images they evoke, and independent of their real sense&mdash;These images vary from age to age, and from race to race&mdash;The wear and tear of words&mdash;Examples of the considerable variations of sense of much-used words&mdash;The political utility of baptizing old things with new names when the words by which they were designated produced an unfavourable impression on the masses&mdash;variations of the sense of words in consequence of race differences&mdash;The different meanings of the word "democracy" in Europe and America.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. ILLUSIONS. Their importance&mdash;They are to be found at the root of all civilisations&mdash;The social necessity of illusions&mdash;Crowds always prefer them to truths.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. EXPERIENCE. Experience alone can fix in the mind of crowds truths become necessary and destroy illusions grown dangerous&mdash;Experience is only effective on the condition that it be frequently repeated&mdash;The cost of the experiences requisite to persuade crowds.
										</p>
										<p>
											4. REASON. The nullity of its influence on crowds&mdash;Crowds only to be influenced by their unconscious sentiments&mdash;The role of logic in history&mdash;The secret causes of improbable events.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="link"><a class="toowide" href="2-3-leaders-means.htm">3. The Leaders of Crowds and Their Means of&nbsp;Persuasion </a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											1. THE LEADERS OF CROWDS. The instinctive need of all beings forming a crowd to obey a leader&mdash;The psychology of the leaders of crowds&mdash;They alone can endow crowds with faith and organise them&mdash;The leaders forcibly despotic&mdash;Classification of the leaders&mdash;The part played by the will.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. THE MEANS OF ACTION OF THE LEADERS. Affirmation, repetition, contagion&mdash;The respective part of these different factors&mdash;The way in which contagion may spread from the lower to the upper classes in a society&mdash;A popular opinion soon becomes a general opinion.
										</p>
										<p>
											3. PRESTIGE. Definition of prestige and classification of its different kinds&mdash;Acquired prestige and personal prestige&mdash;Various examples&mdash;The way in which prestige is destroyed.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="link"><a class="toowide" href="2-4-limitations-of-variability.htm">4. Limitations of The Variability of the Beliefs and Opinions of Crowds </a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											1. FIXED BELIEFS. The invariability of certain general beliefs&mdash;They shape the course of a civilisation&mdash;The difficulty of uprooting them&mdash;In what respect intolerance is a virtue in a people&mdash;The philosophic absurdity of a belief cannot interfere with its spreading.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. THE CHANGEABLE OPINIONS OF CROWDS. The extreme mobility of opinions which do not arise from general beliefs&mdash;Apparent variations of ideas and beliefs in less than a century&mdash;The real limits of these variations&mdash;The matters effected by the variation&mdash;The disappearance at present in progress of general beliefs, and the extreme diffusion of the newspaper press, have for result that opinions are nowadays more and more changeable&mdash;Why the opinions of crowds tend on the majority of subjects towards indifference&mdash;Governments now powerless to direct opinion as they formerly did&mdash;Opinions prevented to-day from being tyrannical on account of their exceeding divergency.

									<li class="link"><a href="3-1-classification.htm">1. The Classification of Crowds</a> </li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											The general divisions of crowds&mdash;Their classification.
										</p>
										<p>
											1. HETEROGENEOUS CROWDS. Different varieties of them&mdash;The influence of race&mdash;The spirit of the crowd is weak in proportion as the spirit of the race is strong&mdash;The spirit of the race represents the civilised state and the spirit of the crowd the barbarian state.
										</p>
										<p>
											2. HOMOGENEOUS CROWDS. Their different varieties&mdash;Sects, castes, and classes.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="link"><a href="3-2-criminal-crowds.htm">2. Crowds Termed Criminal Crowds</a> </li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											Crowds termed criminal crowds&mdash;A crowd may be legally yet not psychologically criminal&mdash;The absolute unconsciousness of the acts of crowds&mdash;Various examples&mdash;Psychology of the authors of the September massacres&mdash;Their reasoning, their sensibility, their ferocity, and their morality.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="link"><a href="3-3-criminal-juries.htm">3. Criminal Juries</a></li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											Criminal juries&mdash;General characteristics of juries&mdash;statistics show that their decisions are independent of their composition&mdash;The manner in which an impression may be made on juries&mdash;The style and influence of argument&mdash;The methods of persuasion of celebrated counsel&mdash;The nature of those crimes for which juries are respectively indulgent or severe&mdash;The utility of the jury as an institution, and the danger that would result from its place being taken by magistrates.

									<li class="contents">
										<p>

										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="link"><a href="3-5-parliamentary.htm">5. Parliamentary Assemblies</a> </li>
									<li class="contents">
										<p>
											Parliamentary crowds present most of the characteristics common to heterogeneous crowds that are not anonymous&mdash;The simplicity of their opinions&mdash;Their suggestibility and its limits&mdash;Their indestructible, fixed opinions and their changed opinions&mdash;The reason of the predominance of indecision&mdash;The role of the leaders&mdash;The reason of their prestige&mdash;They are the true masters of an assembly whose votes, on that account, are merely those of a small minority&mdash;The absolute power they exercise&mdash;The elements of their oratorical art&mdash;Phrases and images&mdash;The psychological necessity the leaders are under of being in a general way of stubborn convictions and narrow-minded&mdash;It is impossible for a speaker without prestige to obtain recognition for his arguments&mdash;The exaggeration of the sentiments, whether good or bad, of assemblies&mdash;At certain moments they become automatic&mdash;The sittings of the Convention&mdash;Cases in which an assembly loses the characteristics of crowds&mdash;The influence of specialists when technical questions arise&mdash;The advantages and dangers of a parliamentary system in all countries&mdash;It is adapted to modern needs; but it involves financial waste and the progressive curtailment of all liberty&mdash;Conclusion.
