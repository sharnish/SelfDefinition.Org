								<p>God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear.</p>
								<p>&ndash; Romans 11:8</p>
							</div>
							<p>Whether in an &quot;advanced&quot; society, in a &quot;backward&quot; tribe, in business, in industry, in the military, in a cult group, or along a lonely highway, the mind control process is essentially the same. The principle for controlling the minds of men would seem to operate as follows: severe stress, shock, fear, tension, excitement or anxiety are imposed upon the unsuspecting individual by subjecting him to arbitrary and frightening authority, by placing him in an unfamiliar situation, by bewildering him, by upsetting him with petty or slanderous remarks.</p>
							<p>The resulting emotional reactions: stress, shock, surprise, anger, fright or revulsion will then lead to the onset of brain inhibition, paralysis, and the hypnotic state. The conscious, reasoning mind is effectively short-circuited, put out of action, by-passed, and the subconscious mind, now void of its guardian, is suddenly exposed for possession and programming.</p>
							<p>If the excitement is moderate rather than sudden and violent, prolonged stimulation will be necessary to cause the onset of hypnosis. The victim has no choice but to submit, to submit to a force greater than himself. While in this trance state the subconscious mind cannot resist being programmed in a gainful, criminal way.</p>
							<p>Hypnosis is natural. Hypnosis, like sex, is a fact of life. Both animals and humans are susceptible to this natural phenomenon. Briefly, hypnosis is simply the effect of force, of fear, of power, of authority over the weak. It is the influence of one animal over another; of one person or group over another; a powerful personality dominating a weaker personality. The dictator dominating his nation with terror; the military officer dominating the soldiers with the fear of reprisal; the employer dominating the employees with the fear of financial loss; the police officer dominating the citizens with fear of being fined or incarcerated; the SLA terrorists dominating Patricia Hearst with the fear of death; Charles Manson dominating his &quot;family&quot; with the fear of being ostracized &ndash; ad nauseum.</p>
							<p>Fear and awe plus authority make for an effective combination. When this combination is manipulated by anyone who understands this human weakness, there arises in the mind of the intended victim a deadly form of hypnosis.</p>
							<p>Obedience to authority which has been praised as a virtue by those in authority is simply a conditioning of society, a pressure towards conformity, a hypnosis that has far reaching consequences. Obedience to authority is the allpowerful force behind every hypnotic phenomena; without it there is no hypnosis.</p>
							<p>The mass murder-suicide of the People's Temple Movement is not unprecedented in the annals of history. On his behest Joseph Stalin, in an effort to consolidate his power, his authoritative position, insisted that the whole leadership of the Communist Party that conquered Russia commit suicide. Like Jim Jones, Joseph Stalin was the leader to whom they had hypnotically given themselves body and soul. Those who would not die for their leader were considered traitors and murdered. A great many devoted communists confessed to trumped-up charges, although they could not possibly have committed them, and demanded their own death. The men on trial had been systematically reduced to submissive puppets. And their puppeteers called the tune.<sup>*</sup></p>
							<p>An authority, if sufficiently believed, will unquestionably be obeyed. Allen Wood, a &quot;Moonie&quot; who defected after five years with &quot;Reverend&quot; Sun Myung Moon, leader of the controversial Unification Church, says, &quot;I've never seen anyone as authoritative as Mr. Moon... Given that commanding force and intense conviction of his religious convictions, you just know that Mr. Moon believes that he is what he says he is.&quot;</p>
							<p>If we are caught up with authority, and most people are, the professional hypnotist can put us under by the simple application of his confident, authoritative, overbearing manner. He does not need fancy crystal balls or swinging pendulums. The professional hypnotist depends on his reputation, position, and prestige; the awe, expectation and suggestibility of his audience. Expectation can be aroused through the medium of fear. The audience may be in great awe of the hypnotist due to prearranged publicity and advertisements. The subjects chosen from the audience may be fearful and apprehensive that they will succumb to the influence of the hypnotist.</p>
							<p>Franz Anton Mesmer, one of the first professional hypnotists, spared no pains to make his exhibitions as awesome, impressive, inspiring and emotionally tense as possible in order to create the effect that mysterious forces were at work. Mesmer got very close to the truth about hypnosis. The alarmed hierarchy tried to censure him. He was first ridiculed, later he had to flee France for his life.</p>
							<p>If we closely watch a professional hypnotist operate, we will notice that he does not &quot;suggest&quot;; he &quot;persuades,&quot; he &quot;commands.&quot; He does not say, &quot;Please, don't you think you should close your eyes?&quot; Instead, he commands authoritatively, &quot;You will now close your eyes.&quot;</p>
							<p>If the hypnotist uses startling methods, and if the subject is nervous, tense and expectant, the subject will easily slip into a hypnotic trance. Hypnotists who use as a technique &quot;surprise attack&quot; have few failures. Occasionally, the stern, piercing &quot;hypnotic&quot; eyes of the hypnotist will cause a cowering subject to go into deep hypnosis through fear alone.</p>
							<p>Hypnosis can be induced by some strong excitement such as a loud noise, a sudden threatening gesture, or even a scream. The sudden introduction of a bright light into a darkened room can also induce a state of hypnosis.</p>
							<p>Our personal vulnerability depends a great deal on our emotional makeup and nervous system that we have inherited. Tense and anxious people can be more effectively hypnotized than calm, placid ones.</p>
							<p>The revolutionaries who helped put Lenin into power were also condemned to exile to death after these revolutionaries had served their purpose.</p>
							<p>Even when hypnosis is used for entertainment, medical, or analgesic purposes, its dark, sinister, evil side, though still present, can be easily concealed from inquisitive people.</p>
							<p>Early Russian psychopoliticians have stated: &quot;...a population must be made to believe that a hypnotized person will not do anything against his actual will, will not commit immoral acts, and will not act as to endanger himself. While this may be true of light, parlor hypnosis, it certainly is not true of commands implanted with the use of electric shock, drugs or heavy punishment... In order to induce a high state of hypnogogy in an individual... an element of terror must be present on the part of those who would govern... One must only exhibit enough force, enough inhumanity, enough brutality and savageness to create... implicit obedience... the most optimum obedience is unthinking obedience. The command given must be obeyed without any rationalizing on the part of the subject. The command must, therefore, be implanted below the thinking processes of the subject to be influenced, and must react upon him in such a way as to bring no mental alertness on his part...&quot;.</p>
