								<p>Be sober, be watchful; your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.</p>
								<p>&ndash; 1 Peter 5:8</p>
							</div>
							<p>Animals do not experience emotions as we do. The gazelle that reacts to danger reacts one of two ways: to run or to fight. A gazelle that is running from a lion is doing the proper thing; it is no match for the lion, therefore the only action it can take is to run. A gazelle that is being pursued by the lion is not really afraid; &ndash; at least not as we would be under similar circumstances. Had this episode happened to any of us we would have remained afraid for days and even weeks afterward. As a matter of fact, we become traumatized by such an experience and may remain fearful, emotional cripples for the remainder of our lives; &ndash; getting worse as each new trauma builds, like onion skins, over the original trauma. The experiences remain not only in our minds but also in our bodies.</p>
							<p>Fear does not linger with animals as it does with us. With us, fear stimulates thought, thought sustains fear, and fear leads to hypnosis.</p>
							<p>Animals react in the moment and when that moment is past everything is back to normal. For example, the flock of gazelle that was disturbed by the lion is soon back to munching grass as if nothing had happened. They pay no attention to their companion being devoured a short distance away. Fear does not linger with animals as it does with us. Animals do not have the capacity for thought which sustains fear.</p>
							<p>The stresses that the animals experience are evolutionary. The animals, unlike us, do not retain their experiences in mind, only in the body. In time, due to the evolutionary process, the animals develop stronger and longer legs with which to evade the stomachs of their predators.</p>
							<p>We are different from animals, we do not evolve from stress; we die from it. Stress incorrectly met raises havoc with our bodies. Stress gives rise to a host of illnesses from ulcers to heart attacks.</p>
							<p>Being different from animals we must be very careful how we respond to stress, duress, threats or any other stimuli. We must be very careful of our emotions. We must be careful that our emotions are not aroused by external stimulation or provocation. Reacting in this manner creates thoughts. Thoughts create feelings and feelings create action; we then lose control of the situation. If our reactions are not modified by reason in Grace we are powerless to stop our reactions. The activity has by-passed our conscious, reasoning mind. This is the same process that takes place with animals. However, with animals, there is no reasoning, thinking, conscious mind to by-pass.</p>
							<p>Let us go back to our hypothetical lion and fallen gazelle. The gazelle is fearful, it is rigid, it is immobilized; it is in a deep hypnotic trance. It is not in a coma or sleep; it is very much alert; it follows every move of the lion with its eyes.</p>
							<p>Once the gazelle is overwhelmed by the lion, a wordless process takes place in the mind of the gazelle. It may go something like this: &quot;You are stronger than I am, you have bigger teeth than I do, you have the upper hand; therefore, I surrender, I submit to you, do with me as you wish.&quot;</p>
							<p>The struggle for survival is over. The gazelle is at the disposal of the lion. There is no struggle, there is no resistance, there is no objection. There is complete surrender. This is hypnosis.</p>
							<p>Nature is merciful. Fear has created a state of shock in the gazelle, shock numbs the pain of the tearing flesh and crushing bones. In the process of being devoured, the gazelle becomes a part of something greater than itself, it becomes a part of the lion.</p>
							<p>Nature obeys unseen laws. Fallen man is also subject to these same laws. When we react to external stimuli, when our reactions are not modified by reason in Grace, we become hypnotized; we become a part of something greater than we are; we serve it and do its bidding; we become consumed by Satan and his cohorts.</p>
							<p>Satan understands human weaknesses and can accurately predict our responses to his provocations. We become psychically and physically victimized by unrecognized forces that feed on us all. Satan fights hard to attain his purpose; to use an earthly phrase, he wages war to the teeth. He wars against man; he wars to get possession of the minds of men so that they can do his will on earth.</p>
