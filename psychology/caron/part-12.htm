								<p>And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</p>
								<p>&ndash; Romans 12:2</p>

							<p>The lay person does not understand what meditation really is. To him meditation is sitting in a lotus position and repeating certain &quot;sacred&quot; words or mantras as is the case for Zen and Transcendental Meditation (TM). There is a great deal of publicity concerning TM: that it lowers the blood pressure, lowers the metabolic rate, relaxes the body and provides a host of other temporary physical benefits. Although TM does bring about some physical alterations, it does not heal the spiritual sickness of man.</p>
							<h4>WARNING</h4>
							<p>Transcendental Meditation is, in reality, a prayer to a demonic deity. The meditator may find himself obligated to the point where he has hell to pay, a retribution to make, for the &quot;benefits&quot; and escape from reality that TM provides.</p>
							<p>There is no doubt that repeating a mantra or certain words, sacred or not, quiets a disturbed, agitated mind and provides some temporary relief. A mantra, like a drug, dulls the mind, it slows down the thought process. It is a &quot;spiritual&quot; tranquilizer that provides temporary escape from anxiety, from reality, from the agent of disturbance. A mantra is an aid to achieve self-hypnosis, which is what TM really is. The mind goes into neutral with the constant repetition, starts to &quot;freewheel,&quot; the consciousness is impaired, and hypnosis ensues. Self-hypnosis does not help anyone. As a matter of fact, that is what is wrong with the whole world, it is already in a state of hypnosis.</p>
							<p>Repeating mantras, &quot;sacred&quot; words, affirmations, Ave Marias as is done by the Catholics, dulls the mind and a dull mind is called a &quot;quiet&quot; mind which, obviously, it is not. Repeating such words as: Hare Krishna, Rama, Rama, O Lord Jesus, Coca Cola, spaghetti and meat balls, liver and onions, A-umm-m-m, etc., will have the same effect. Drugs, alcohol, marijuana will do the same &ndash; they provide escape, relief from an agitated mind, they are hypnotic. Zen and TM advocates are not different from the drug advocates; they are all trying to escape from a harsh, turbulent, cruel life.</p>
							<p>In the following paragraphs I shall be describing a counter-hypnosis exercise commonly known as a Judeo-Christian meditation-observation exercise. This exercise, when performed diligently and with the right attitude, will enable us to awaken from our hypnotic trance and to regain full control over our minds and bodies. This meditation exercise differs from Zen, TM and other worldly meditations in that the mind is not preoccupied with repeating stupid mantras or Sanskrit words.</p>
							<p>The Judeo-Christian meditation-observation exercise enables us to rise out of our thinking, fantasies and daydreams. It enables us to become aware, conscious, alert to what is going on around us and within us. We begin to deal with our thoughts as if they were aliens in our minds, aliens that are in control of our bodies, in control of our conditioned-reflex responses.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="note"> 1. The meditation-observation exercise is a long forgotten Judeo-Christian meditation that was formerly taught by the ancient Jewish kabbalists and Christian mystics. Roy Masters, founder-director of the Foundation of Human Understanding (an educational, not-for-profit institution), &quot;rediscovered&quot; it several years ago. The meditation is taught in detail by the Foundation of Human Understanding. The meditation exercise is available in cassette form called The Basic Meditation. It can be obtained by writing to: The Foundation of Human Understanding, 8780 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90034. Several books written by Roy Masters that discuss the meditation exercise and emotional problems are listed in the bibliography.</p>


							<p>There are five ingredients necessary if we wish to overcome our hypnotic proclivity, to overcome our enslavement to the world, and to acquire control of our lives and destinies:</p>
							<ul class="generic-no-bullet">
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; We must have a sincere desire to want to know the truth; to want to know the meaning and purpose of life.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; The mind must be still.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; The emotions must be brought under control.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; The meditation-observation exercise must be performed diligently and regularly.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; We must turn our attention inward to the Spirit, and turn away from outside activities and distractions.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The meditation exercise is very simple but the simple is very hard to do. There will be a strong tendency to want to quit, to &quot;climb the walls,&quot; or to run. This is because reality and anxieties are catching up with us; the very things from which we have been running. If we resolve to stick it out, not to be deterred, if we devote ourselves to the exercise as if life and death depended on it, if we persevere with patience and endurance, when we let the truth catch up with us, the rewards will be exceedingly great. Those who lack patience and endurance, who cannot persevere with the regimen required with the meditation exercise, will achieve nothing at all.</p>
							<p>A million and one things will happen as a result of the exercise. It will not only awaken us from our hypnotic slumber but new dimensions, heretofore unseen, will open to our sight and understanding.</p>
							<h4>CAUTION</h4>
							<p>This meditation-observation exercise is not for the squeamish; some very ugly things will be revealed: the kingdom of Satan and all its horrors will first come into focus.</p>
							<p>Much of what happens as a result of the meditation-observation exercise is beyond the scope of this book. The purpose of this book is simply an expose on hypnosis, what we must do to return to the center of our dignity and to overcome the conspiracies and enslavement of the world.</p>
							<p>To begin, set aside periods in your daily activities in which to withdraw into yourself, to be quiet and alone. Meditate where there are no distractions. Go into the &quot;closet&quot; and shut the door to outside activity. This Judeo-Christian meditation is really a prayer, a prayer without words, it is a prayer that consists of silence. The soul must be still to allow the Spirit within to pray to God. (Romans 8:26, 27)</p>
							<p>In the beginning you will not be able to perform the meditation exercise for more than a few minutes at a time. Consequently, it should be done several times a day. As you progress, as you become more disciplined, more patient, you will be able to meditate for twenty, thirty minutes or longer at a time. When this stage is reached a meditation upon getting up in the morning and another before retiring may be sufficient.</p>
							<p>Let us now proceed with the exercise: sit in a straight-backed chair, one preferably without arms, and place your feet squarely on the floor. Do this in the privacy of your room. There must be no distractions such as a blaring radio or TV. Place your hands in your lap and close your eyes. Bring your attention to the middle of your forehead &ndash; this is your thought center.</p>
							<p>Be aware of your thoughts. It will be as if your head is in a beehive and your thoughts are buzzing to and fro, undisciplined and out of control. This is the reason why you are not in control of your life, your thoughts are out of control and they are controlling you. Have you noticed how your thoughts tend to speed up in ever increasing spirals when cruel people intentionally or unintentionally nag, aggravate, and upset you? Have you noticed how your thoughts race when you are sick? Do you see how your thoughts create feelings and how feelings create reaction and how your reactions enslave you and how you give in, surrender, in order to minimize your agony which only brings on more fear, more thoughts, more resentment and more despair? Upsetting you, making you afraid is the secret of hypnosis. To become a whole healthy person you must acquire control of your thoughts and emotional reactions.</p>
							<p>Now place your right hand by your side. Let it dangle. Become aware of your right hand as you remain aware of the center of your forehead. Notice the blood flowing down into your hand. Be aware of the fingers &ndash; the first finger, the second finger, the third finger, etc. Do it slowly, there is no reason to rush, be patient. Notice how your hand tingles, and you may even feel a slight warmth in your hand. Don't worry if, at first, you don't notice these things. The purpose of the hand is to provide a focal point, an anchor in the present when the mind is caught up in the stream of thoughts and daydreams.</p>
							<p>As you are doing the exercise notice how your thoughts pull your attention away from your hand. When you find yourself occupied with thought simply and gently pull back and return your attention to your right hand. Be very aware of your hand. Repeat as before, feel the blood flowing down into the hand, be aware of each finger, going from one to the other. Don't rush, do it gently as if you were doing it for the first time. This is also an exercise in patience.</p>
							<p>The meditation exercise will allow the mind to oscillate back and forth between your thoughts and your hand as you remain aware of the center of your forehead. Become as a bystander on the shore and watch your thoughts stream by; do not become involved with your thoughts. Your thoughts, your fantasies, your daydreams are escapes from the present into the future or the past. Your thoughts are nothing but electro-chemical noises that are fermenting in your mind. Your thoughts have no value. There is no creativity, no realization in thinking. Every time you pull back from being involved with your thoughts you sever a &quot;thread&quot; that held you captive to your thoughts. There are thousands of such &quot;threads&quot; that must be broken. And, in time, you become free of your thoughts.</p>
							<p>Look at yourself without judgment. Be aware of your thoughts without becoming involved with them. Don't suppress unpleasant thoughts, don't chase them away, don't struggle with them; they are you; they are your conditioning, your experiences. Just watch, don't try to correct.</p>
							<p>Observe your fears. Observe how your fears are sustained by memory and by thoughts. Observe how your fears of the present and your fears of the future cause you to shy away from experience. Observe how thinking of past dangers and incidents sustains fear. Observe how fear causes you to capitulate, cripples and cramps your lifestyle; how fear makes you into a recluse.</p>
							<p>Bring into subjection your thoughts, feelings, fantasies and daydreams. Become quiet and still by observing your thoughts as if you were at a distant point. Be patient, don't expect immediate results. Observe without condemnation. Be aware without choice. Look at hell straight in the face.</p>
							<p>Notice that with this meditation exercise thinking and daydreams are not suppressed. You simply separate from them when you find yourself involved with them. Try to remain in the present; try to remain aware of your hand. This detached &quot;distant&quot; observation method often brings out of the subconscious mind painful memories, traumas, psychic injuries. The release of these emotional injuries and poisons is often accompanied with involuntary crying or vomiting. Don't resent what you see or what happens. THIS IS YOU. You were mangled by life and didn't know how to prevent it.</p>
							<p>As you become more objective, as you learn to separate yourself from your thought processes your worries, hostilities, fears will gradually lose their hold over you. Your mind will begin to clear and you will begin to live and respond from a higher consciousness, from divine impulses, instead of from conditioned-reflexes like an animal. After you persevered for a time in meditation you can resume your daily routine. Don't discuss the meditation with anyone just yet. They may not understand and they may try to discourage you. Remember, this is your trip. It should be emphasized that a person who devotes himself to inner spiritual development need not change his everyday occupation, nor neglect his daily duties. Quite the contrary, if he neglects his responsibilities while attempting inner development he would soon become antisocial and an outcast.</p>
							<p>As you progress in privacy, in tranquility and in seclusion with the meditation exercise, gaps will start to occur between thoughts. It is in these gaps, in these brief periods of silence, when the light begins to enter the mind and reveal the secrets, the realities of life.<sup>*</sup> As the gaps become wider, when your thoughts become less active, bliss enters, the hypnotic spell is broken, and you are no longer a slave to worldly influences. You will grow calmer, you will attain serenity in all your actions and you will cease to be perturbed by all manner of incidents and aggravations. You will go through life steadily and you will let things act upon you in all tranquility.</p>
							<p>As you go about your daily tasks you must guard and maintain discipline over your thoughts and feelings. To vent hostility would be damaging to your progress. It is equally injurious to hate a fellow being as to strike him in anger. Be angry and sin not. (Ephesians 4:26) If others have the power to make you react with hostility and resentment you are not the master of yourself. The meditation exercise, if performed correctly, will enable you to resist the impressions, cruelties</p>
							<p>At this point, when the light begins to enter into the mind, the creature of darkness that had its abode in the mind, will let out a scream and flee from you. You may actually get to see it. It may try to frighten you, to deter you from your meditation exercise. Don't be afraid, it is only a spirit and cannot harm anyone.</p>
							<p>and assaults of the world. Formerly a personal affront would have filled you with hatred, with revulsion, now you will remain cool and level headed.</p>
							<p>Your ego must die. You must die to yesterday, today and tomorrow. You must die to ambition, to wants and needs. You must die to the world. Shed your burdens every day; let God rule in your life. It is only when you die to everything does the mind become renewed, refreshed, cleared, bright and tranquil.</p>
							<p>Memories will fade away. Only a mind that is unencumbered with the past is capable of bliss; not a mind that is over-burdened with experiences. You will cease to worry about things that formerly kept your mind occupied. You will acquire a new outlook on life; you will be happy.</p>
							<p>You will begin to steer your ship with a firm hand, secured on a straight course among the waves and reefs of life, which formerly had been a stormy, perilous journey. Bon voyage.</p>
