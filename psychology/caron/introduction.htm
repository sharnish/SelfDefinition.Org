							<p>During the last two thousand years, and especially since the sixteenth century, man has made some tremendous achievements, namely, the conquest of the earth and, more recently, the conquest of space. This one sided purely materialistic pursuit has seriously affected the whole of modern man. What man has gained in material achievements he has had to pay with a corresponding loss in his spiritual faculties and of his freedom.</p>
							<p>Twentieth century man is hypnotized, spiritually barren, and drowning in the swamp of materialism. He is the product of an educational system and culture that prides itself with science, with the intellect, and with the sense world. If it cannot be measured, seen, smelled, touched, heard or tasted it does not exist. Consequently, what cannot be comprehended by the intellect or by the senses cannot be accepted by the conditioned mind. Man's dilemma, his spiritual blindness, attitude, belief, thinking and conditioning are the result of this pedantic, scientific, materialistic training. The net result is that man is left more and more in his &quot;advanced&quot; society without the means of essential spiritual knowledge of himself.</p>
							<p>Modern man, progressing along physical lines, is blind, lacks a will, is hypnotized, programmed, manipulated and exploited by processes which he does not understand. He is oblivious of and subject to the dark, sinister, satanic forces that abound in this world; forces that are in control of his thinking, his life, his environment, his destiny and, ultimately, his death. These forces are ambitiously at work in a materialistic, technological world. They have provided man with an astonishing array of technical accomplishments, conveniences and instruments for extending the senses but they have done nothing in regard to deepening man's intuitive awareness or to raise his consciousness. These forces are actually involved in processes that are calculated to reduce men into becoming zombies, automatons. These forces are systematically destroying humanity.</p>
							<p>Since man is a duality, animal and spiritual, the loss of his spiritual nature gave rise to his animal nature and, consequently, his senses became subject to the pressures of the external world, his environment. His environment then began to crowd into him forcing him to conform in an hypnotic manner to its insidious, and often gross, invisible demands. He became subject to outside impressions, pressures, cruelties, pain and carnal pleasures. He became a stimuli-response mechanism. Man, in his fallen state, is compelled to obey these forces; he is powerless, a slave to their insidious controls.</p>
							<p>Never before has the need for man to be a free, whole, human being been more urgent than in today's disoriented society where everything is back-to-front, where the lie is the &quot;truth,&quot; where the forces of evil prevail, where moral chaos is the rule, where modern technology has contributed to a polluted environment. Robotized man must wake up to what is going on and reverse the process; otherwise civilization as we know it will no longer exist.</p>
							<p>A tragedy of this threatening century is that all of our psychological doctrines and medical concepts are concerned not with complete man, but only with a soul-less, spiritless living corpse &ndash; his physical body. This kind of unscientific &quot;science&quot; is already formulating an apparatus of mental coercion that may make the inquisition of the thirteenth century seem gentle in comparison.</p>
							<p>In the following chapters I have tried to describe the magnitude, the power, the modus operandi and extent of the satanic forces that are in control of this world, their influence upon man and why man is subject to them. I have also attempted to describe in the closing chapter a meditation-observation exercise that, if practiced diligently and with a proper attitude, will awaken and free the aspirant from his hypnotic enslavement to worldly conspiracies. The awakening process must be gradual. It is very much like waking up the sleepwalker when he is at the edge of a precipice &ndash; the sudden awakening, the sudden fright may cause him to tumble over the edge.</p>
							<p>The meditation-observation exercise is specially designed to still the mind, to still the intellect, to still the thinking process and the emotions. Only then can we look within at ourselves and at the world without judgment or prejudice. Only by the diligent performance of this exercise and a willingness to want to know the truth can the soul awaken from its slumber. Then slowly another dimension becomes evident, a spirit world, a world consisting of evil forces and good forces, and our unconscious involvement with them.</p>
							<p>We must remain watchful that we are not tricked into hating these evil forces. They are God-created and, I must admit, they are doing their job exceedingly well &ndash; to awaken us to reality, to make us seek, to make us find the meaning of life, to make us discover that there is a God.</p>
							<p>The fruition of this exercise depends more upon a proper attitude, a sincere desire to want to know the truth, than upon the employment of the exercise itself. Though the meditation exercise is simple, it is extremely difficult in its simplicity. If we are strong enough to resist the inclination to &quot;climb the walls,&quot; to run or to quit the exercise, if we persevere then the truth will surface and will reveal to us a new world which, heretofore, was not visible or even suspected. The truth lies deeply hidden within each one of us. It is a matter of becoming patient, of becoming quiet within, and clearing obstacles such as pride, egotism and psychic injuries and, in time, the truth will reveal itself. The meditation exercise is not without pain and a few surprises. There may be a catharsis as ancient traumas bubble to the surface and there may even be an exorcism.</p>
							<p>Thus in quiet solitude can we awaken from our hypnotic sleep and acquire understanding of the physical world and of the spirit world. Only by becoming still can we change our lives, be &quot;born again&quot; on a higher plane, and become united with the timeless One. The rewards are exceedingly great for those who persist and endure. &quot;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&quot;</p>
							<p>Life is a painful process, life is a school, life is a training calculated to awaken us, to cause us to seek for a meaning to our problems. If we do not try to escape from our travail into drugs, alcohol, and other practices calculated to dull the senses, to dull the consciousness, to lower the awareness, to dull the pain of living a life wrongly but, instead, if we earnestly seek for a meaning to life, we will ultimately find the answers. Only then can we begin to steer our ship through the course of life with confidence and firmness which formerly had been a turbulent, stormy, purposeless journey.</p>
