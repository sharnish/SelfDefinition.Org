								<p>... Through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the Western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive... we have been through a spiritual training far in advance of Western experience.</p>
								<p>&ndash; Alexsandr I. Solzhenitsyn, Exiled Russian Dissenter</p>
							</div>
							<p>Humanity needs the manure of evil, in order to attain spiritual growth... This is the mission of evil. &ndash; Rudolf Steiner, Mystic Investigations in Occultism</p>
							<p>There are two kingdoms on this earth, the kingdom of Satan and the kingdom of Jesus Christ. We are all born into the kingdom of Satan. We are his property, his slaves. Satan's kingdom with all of its wars, destructions, miseries, sicknesses, blind unquestioning hypnotic obedience is necessary for several reasons:</p>
							<ul class="generic-no-bullet">
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; It matures and develops an infantile soul and personality.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; It provides for our spiritual growth.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; The pain of our hypnotic servitude prods us to seek for answers to the meaning of life &ndash; and those who seek find.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>&ndash; Good cannot be realized or appreciated without its counterpart &ndash; evil.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Anyone who is not dazed or stupefied by drugs and drink can see the course of evil weave its influence upon the world. Anyone who is not escaping from the agonies of life can see the moral outrages being perpetrated against a naive populace by the media, by business, by industry, by government. Anyone who wishes to see can see the decay, the erosion of moral principles, the increases in pornography, illicit sex, abortions, drug addiction and alcoholism; the wanton exploitation and destruction of the people by their appointed authorities.</p>
							<p>The authorities we have selected as our guides and protectors have failed us and have brought upon us wars, racism, unrest, deprivation, poverty, high taxes, inflation and decay. They have given us economic difficulties with their mismanagements. They have caused national and political division and spiritual impoverishment. They enact thousands of new laws every year, yet justice and freedom are rapidly disappearing from the American scene. Laws, more often than not, are enacted to serve one special interest group over another, to intimidate, to control. The authorities are more vigilant in creating unjust &quot;laws&quot; by which they can control the people, than in preventing predatory practices by some people over others. By the enforcement of such laws, the government itself is the biggest predator. The government has no power over the innocent. The only power it has is against criminals. By making innocent people break its unjust laws it is able to create criminals. They then inflict cruel and unusual punishment in the guise of correction. The victims then rise in rebellion in an attempt to destroy what is destroying them thus unwittingly giving more power to the government.</p>
							<p>Because of internal strife we have become a country where old age and decline have set in before the bloom of maturity &ndash; and this country is only about 200 years old.</p>
							<p>The stresses of modern life have made us into a nation of neurotics. One out of ten, in this country, has a severe mental problem because he doesn't know how to cope with life. The neurotic goes to a psychiatrist for help only to find that the psychiatrist is just as nutty as he is, and he doesn't have the answers to the riddles of life either. The neurotic is given pills and drugs to lower the level of his consciousness so that he no longer sees what is bugging him. The neurotic then lives in a state of suppressed awareness, in a state of artificial bliss; unable to deal with reality, unable to deal with his problems, and unable to cry out to God.</p>
							<p>Yes, the higher we rise materially the lower we sink spiritually. Our fall brings on a host of mental and physical illnesses. Modern, materialistic, sick, 20th century man is in a steep moral decline; he is rapidly sinking into the morass and pollution of the carnal, physical, material world. This decline is destroying humanity, is making man into a cipher. This decline was not meant to sicken man but to awaken him. The pain, the agony of life is designed to awaken man from his hypnotic sleep; to awaken him to the Christ influence that will then show him the way out of the trap, and upward to a spiritual life.</p>
							<p>Until the time of maturity, until the time of salvation we can do little about our dilemma except to desire not to be influenced by these evil forces. A cry must rise up to God in a moment of need, in a moment of agony, in a moment of helplessness: &quot;God, please help me.&quot; It is a cry in the wilderness; it is a cry heard by God.</p>
							<p>We should be grateful that we were obliged and able to cry out to God, otherwise we would have remained in bondage to Satan's kingdom both in life and in death.</p>
							<p>We must not hate evil. Flowers do not hate the manure that is so essential for their growth and beauty. We must not associate with evil. We must not support evil; if we expose evil in the light of truth we can see it shrivel and flee from us. There is a great deal of danger when we are tempted to hate evil: we take on its identity, we take on its character, we become like it.</p>
							<p>A soul that is submerged in the turbulent ocean of the physical world can never become free of that world if it remains subjective to its emotions and does not aspire to remain tranquil under trying circumstances.</p>
							<p>We must learn to maintain inner calm and confidence when faced with difficult circumstances. If someone affronts us we must not rise up with anger against the wrongdoer; we must meet such affront with calmness and composure. It is equally spiritually injurious to hate a fellow being as to strike him. He may need to be belted one but we must not do it with hate and hostility. We must not condemn the wrongdoer; we must try to understand his personality; we must try to understand the demon that possesses him. He has a destiny to fulfill, so that we can fulfill our own destinies. We cannot develop our character, our godly nature without evil. To repeat an old adage, a bullfighter cannot develop his skills without the bull.</p>
							<p>We must watch our words, actions and thoughts; evil can be combated by the creation of good. We must learn to face dangers calmly. We must understand that fear is useless and stems from a lack of faith. We must concentrate on what must be done; we must overcome difficulties unswervingly. If we control our emotions and other negative qualities we are removing the shackles that imprisoned our souls in the dungeon of the world.</p>
							<p>There was a time in our lives when our emotions were necessary for growth; however, if these emotions are sustained beyond maturity, they become deadly to us. Emotions which are necessary for animals because of the evolutionary process will now direct us to our doom because of another process &ndash; the &quot;evil-utionary&quot; process.</p>
							<p>To summarize, during the first part of our lives we are plunged into hell on earth to develop and strengthen our soul and character. During the second part of our lives our matured souls then ascend to higher spiritual realms. The trials, tribulations, and stresses which were essential for our spiritual development are left behind or minimized as we progress along the spiritual path. &quot;We are first of nature, then of Spirit.&quot;</p>
