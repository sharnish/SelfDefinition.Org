							<p>EDITORIAL NOTE</p>
							<p>This book is a synthesis of information gathered through observation, discussion, investigation and experience over the last ten years.</p>
							<p>I cannot entirely vouch for its authenticity. Disclosure of the sources from which it is drawn would undoubtedly lead to great difficulties for them. And in matters of this kind the Soviet is not accustomed to the issuance of validations.</p>
							<p>Having compiled this volume I did not easily discover any method of distributing it since my own facilities and finances are, as is customary with professors, necessarily limited. Further, the placement of this volume in anyone's hands constituted to some degree a considerable risk to myself until I realized that there actually were two American groups in the field of mental science who were entirely above suspicion, particularly since they were often mentioned as Soviet targets by my informers and were mentioned in the actual text of this book as being antipathetic to this Soviet programme. These two groups were the Christian Scientists and the Dianeticists. Christian Science is an American Religion, intensely patriotic. Dianetics is the only entirely American development in the field of the human mind.</p>
							<p>Knowing from my information sources that Dianetics and Christian Science and their people have experienced years of mauling and defamation at Communist hands, I am submitting to these organizations this work. I wish to express here my appreciation for their bold resistance to Communism through the years.</p>
							<p>I wish also to express my confidence in the future of the free nations of earth. Although the soviet has found a chink in the armour of individual liberty, it is certain that Democratic processes can mend it. That only the individual himself can protest against assault and injury to him before law, joined with the fact that the insane have no rights before law, has permitted in itself this deep ingress into our country's security. So long as this legal hole exists, there is then no law against driving anyone insane, even though this ction deals as finally with a person as does murder. The existence today of highly efficient drugs such as LSD, one-millionth of an ounce of which can create insanity, brings this legal loophole into focus. By enacting legislation permitting a friend or next of kin to bring charges in case of assault, and by quickly placing all treatment of and institutions for the insane in the hands of ministers, taking it entirely out of the hands of European indoctrinated practitioners, the entire effort of psychopolitics can be nullified at once.</p>
							<p>If you care to check this subject of psychopolitics against current occurrences in the American scene you will discover the urgency of such measures.</p>
