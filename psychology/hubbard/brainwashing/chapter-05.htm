							<p>If loyalty is so important in the economic and social structure, it is necessary to examine it further as itself.</p>
							<p>In the field of Psychopolitics, loyalty means simply &quot;alignment&quot;. It means, more fully, alignment with the goals of the Communist State. Disloyalty means entirely misalignment, and more broadly, misalignment with the goals of the Communist State.</p>
							<p>When we consider that the goals of the Communist State are to the best possible benefit of the masses, we can see that disloyalty, as a term, can embrace Democratic alignment. Loyalty to persons not communistically indoctrinated would be quite plainly a misalignment.</p>
							<p>The cure of disloyalty is entirely contained in the principles of alignment. All that it is necessary to do, where disloyalty is encountered, is to align the purposes of the individual toward the goals of Communism, and it will be discovered that a great many circumstances hitherto distasteful in his existence will cease to exist.</p>
							<p>A heart, or a kidney in rebellion against the remainder of the organism is being disloyal to the remainder of the organism. To cure that heart or kidney it is actually only necessary to bring its activities into alignment with the remainder of the body.</p>
							<p>The technologies of Psychopolitics adequately demonstrate the workability of this. Mild shock of the electric variety can, and does, produce the re-cooperation of a rebellious body organ. It is the shock and punishment of surgery which, in the main, accomplishes the realignment of a disaffected portion of the body, rather that the surgery itself. It is the bombardment of X-rays, rather than the therapeutic value of X-rays which causes some disaffected organ to once again turn its attention to the support of the general organism.</p>
							<p>While it is not borne out that electric shock has any therapeutic value, so far as making the individual more sane, it is adequately brought out that its punishment value will create in the patient a greater cooperative attitude. Brain surgery has no statistical data to recommend it beyond its removal of the individual personality from amongst the paths of organs which were not permitted to cooperate. </p>
							<p>These two Russian developments have never pretended to alter the state of sanity. They are only effective and workable in introducing an adequate punishment mechanism to the personality to make it cease and desist from its courses and egotistical direction of the anatomy itself. It is the violence of the electric shock and the surgery which is useful in subduing the recalcitrant personality, which is all that stands in the road of the masses or the State. It is occasionally to be discovered that the removal of the preventing personality by shock and surgery then permits the re-growth and re-establishment of organs which have been rebelled against by that personality. In that a well-regulated state is composed of organisms, not personalities, the use of electric shock and brain surgery in Psychopolitics is clearly demonstrated.</p>
							<p>The changing of loyalty consists, in its primary step, of the eradication of existing loyalties. This can be done in one of two ways. First, by demonstrating that previously existing loyalties have brought about perilous physical circumstances, such as imprisonment, lack of recognition, duress, or privation, and second, by eradicating the personality itself.</p>
							<p>The first is accomplished by a steady and continuous indoctrination of the individual in the belief that his previous loyalties have been granted to an unworthy source. One of the primary instances in this is creating circumstances which apparently derive from the target of his loyalties, so as to rebuff the individual. As part of this there is the creation of a state of mind in the individual by actually placing him under duress, and then furnishing him with false evidence to demonstrate that the target of his previous loyalties is, itself, the course of the duress. Another portion of this same method consists of defaming or degrading the individual whose loyalties are to be changed to the target of his loyalties, i.e., superiors or government, to such a degree that this target, at length, actually does hold the individual in disrepute, and so does rebuff him and serve to convince him that his loyalties have been misplaced. These are the milder methods, but have proven extremely effective. The greatest drawback in their practice is that they require time and concentration, the manufacture of false evidence, and a psychopolitical operator's time.</p>
							<p>In moments of expediency, of which there are many, the personality itself can be rearranged by shock, surgery, duress, privation and, in particular, the best of psychopolitical techniques, implantation, with the technologies of neo-hypnotism. Such duress must have in its first part a defamation of the loyalties, and its second, the <em>implanation</em> of new loyalties. A good and experienced psychopolitical operator, working under the most favourable circumstances, can, by the use of psychopolitical technologies, alter the loyalties of an individual so deftly that his own companions will not suspect that they have changed. This, however, require considerably more finesse than is usually necessary to the situation. Mass neo-hypnotism can accomplish more or less the same results when guided by an experienced psychopolitical operator. An end goal in such a procedure would be the alteration of the loyalties of an entire nation in a short period of time by mass neo-hypnotism, a thing which has been effectively accomplished among the less-usable states of Russia.</p>
							<p>It is adequately demonstrated that loyalty is entirely lacking in that mythical commodity known as &quot;spiritual quality&quot;. Loyalty is entirely a thing of dependence, economic or mental, and can be changed by the crudest implementations. Observation of workers in their factories or fields demonstrates that they easily grand loyalty to a foreman or a woman, and then as easily abandon it and substitute another individual, revulsing, at the same time, toward the person to whom loyalty was primarily granted. The queasy insecurity of the masses in Capitalistic nations finds this more common than in an enlightened State such as Russia. In Capitalistic states, dependencies are so craven, wants and privation are so exaggerated, that loyalty is entirely without ethical foundation and exists only in the realm of dependency, duress, or demand.</p>
							<p>It is fortunate that Communism so truly approaches an ideal state of mind, for this brings a certain easiness into any changing of loyalties, since all other philosophies extant and practiced on Earth today are degraded and debased, compared to Communism. It is then with a certain security that a psychopolitical operator functions, for he knows that he can change the loyalty of an individual to a more ideal level by reason alone, and only expediency makes it necessary to employ the various shifts of psychopolitical technology. Any man who cannot be persuaded into Communist rationale is, of course, to be regarded as somewhat less than sane, and it is, therefore, completely justified to use the techniques of insanity upon the non-Communist.</p>
							<p>In order to change loyalty it is necessary to establish first the existing loyalties of the individual. The task made very simple in view of the fact that Capitalistic and Fascistic nations have no great security in the loyalty of their subjects. And it may be found that the loyalties of the subjects, as we call any person against whom psychopolitical technology is to be exerted, are already faint to require eradication. It is generally only necessary to persuade with the rationale and overwhelming reasonability of Communism to have the person grant his loyalty to the Russia State. However, regulated only by the importance of the subject, no great amount of time should be expended upon the individual, but emotional duress, or electric shock, or brain surgery should be resorted to, should Communist propaganda fail. </p>
							<p>In a case of a very important person, it may be necessary to utilize the more delicate technologies of Psychopolitics so as to place the person himself, and his associates, in ignorance of the operation. In this case a simple <em>implanation</em> is used, with a maximum duress and command value. Only the most skilled psychopolitical operator should be employed on such a project, as in this case of the very important person, for a bungling might disclose the tampering with his mental processes. It is much more highly recommended, if there is any doubt whatever about the success of an operation against an important person, to select out as a psychopolitical target persons in his vicinity in whom he is emotionaly involved. His Wife or children normally furnish the best targets, and these can be operated against without restraint.</p>
							<p> In securing the loyalty of a very important person one must place at his side a constant pleader who enters a sexual or familial chord into the situation on the side of Communism. It may not be necessary to make a Communist out of the wife, or the childen, or one of the children, but it might prove efficacious to do so. In most instances, however, this is not possible. </p>
							<p>By the use of various drugs, it is, in this modern age, and well within the realm of psychopolitical reality, entirely too easy to bring about a state of severe neurosis or insanity in the wife or children, and thus pass them, with full consent of the important person and the government in which he exists, or the bureau in which he is operating, into the hands of a psychopolitical operator, who then in his own laboratory, without restraint or fear of investigation or censor can, with electric shock, surgery, sexual attack, drugs, or other useful means, degrade or entirely alter the personality of a family member, and create in that person a psychopolitical slave subject who then, on command or signal, will perform outrageous actions, thus discrediting the important person, or will demand, on a more delicate level, that certain measures be taken by the important person, which measures are, of course, dictated by the psychopolitical operator.</p>
							<p>Usually when the party has no real interest in the activities or decisions of the important person, but merely wishes to remove him from effective action, the attention of the psychopolitical operator need not be so intense, and the person need only be passed into the hands of some unwitting mental practitioner, who taught as he is by psychopolitical operators, will bring about sufficient embarrassment.</p>
							<p>When the loyalty of an individual cannot be swerved, and where the opinion, weight, or effectiveness of the individual stands firmly in the road of Communist goals, it is usually best to occasion a mild neurosis into the person by any available means, and then, having carefully given him a history of mental imbalance, to see to it that he disposes of himself by suicide, or to bring about his demise in such a way as to resemble suicide. Psychopolitical operators have handled such situations skilfully tens of thousands of times within and without Russia.</p>
							<p>It is the firm principle of Psychopolitics that the person to be destroyed must be involved at first or second hand in the stigma of insanity, and must have been placed in contact with psychopolitical operators or persons trained by them, with a maximum amount of tumult and publicity. The stigma of insanity is properly placed at the door of such a person's reputation and is held there firmly by bringing about irrational acts, either on his own part or in his vicinity. Such an activity can be classified as a partial destruction of alignment, and if this destruction is carried forward to its furthest extent the mis-alignment on the subject of all loyalties can be considered to be complete, and alignment on new loyalties can be embarked upon safely. By bringing about insanity or suicide on the part of the wife of an important political personage, a sufficient mis-alignment has been instigated to change his attitude. And this, carried forward firmly, or assisted by psychopolitical <em>implanation</em> can begin the rebuilding of his loyalties, but now slanted in a more proper and fitting direction.</p>
							<p>Another reason for the alignment of psychopolitical activities with the mis-alignment of insanity is that insanity itself is a despised and disgraced state, and anything connected with it is lightly viewed. Thus, a psychopolitical operator, working in the vicinity of an insane person, can refute and disprove any accusations made against him by demonstrating that the family itself is tainted with mental imbalance. This is surprisingly effective in Capitalistic countries where insanity is so thoroughly feared that no one would dream of investigating any circumstances in its vicinity. Psychopolitical propaganda works constantly and must work constantly to increase and build up this aura of mystery surrounding insanity, and must emphasize the horribleness and hopelessness of insanity in order to excuse non-therapeutic actions taken against the insane. Particularly in Capitalistic countries, an insane person has no rights under law. No person who is insane may hold property. No person who is insane may testify. Thus, we have an excellent road along which we can travel toward our certain goal and destiny.</p>
							<p>Entirely by bringing about public conviction that the sanity of a person is in question, it is possible to discount and eradicate all of goals and activities of that person. By demonstrating the insanity of a group, or even a government, it is possible, then, to cause its people to disavow it. By magnifying the general human reaction to insanity, through keeping the subject of insanity itself forever before the public eye, and then, by utilizing this reaction by causing a revulsion on the part of a populace against its leader or leaders, it is possible to stop any government or movement.</p>
							<p>It is important to know that the entire subject of loyalty is thus as easily handled as it is. One of the first and foremost missions of the psychopolitician is to make an attack upon Communism and insanity synonymous. It should become the definition of insanity, of the paranoid variety, that, &quot;A paranoid believes he is being attacked by Communists&quot;. Thus, at once the support of the individual so attacking Communism will fall away and wither.</p>
							<p>Instead of executing national leaders, suicide for them should be arranged under circumstances which question their demise. In this way we can select out all opposition to the Communist extension into the social orders of the world, and render populaces who would oppose us leaderless, and bring about a state of chaos or mis-alignment into which we can thrust, with great simplicity, the clear and forceful doctrines of Communism.</p>
							<p>The cleverness of our attack in this field of Psychopolitics is adequate to avoid the understanding of the layman and the usual stupid official, and by operating entirely under the banner of authority, with the oft-repeated statement that the principles of psychotherapy are too devious for common understanding, an entire revolution can be effected without the suspicion of a populace until it is an accomplished fact.</p>
							<p>As insanity is the maximum mis-alignment, it can be grasped to be the maximum weapon in severance of loyalties to leaders and old social orders. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that psychopolitical operatives infiltrate the healing arts of a nation marked for conquest, and bring from that quarter continuous pressure against the population and the government until at last the conquest is affected. This is the subject and goal of Psychopolitics, itself.</p>
							<p>In rearranging loyalties we must have a command of their values. In the animal the first loyalty is to himself. This is destroyed by demonstrating errors to him, showing him that he does not remember, cannot act or does not trust himself. The second loyalty is to his family unit, his parents and brothers and sisters. This is destroyed by making a family unit economically non-dependent, by lessening the value of marriage, by making an easiness of divorce and by raising the children wherever possible by the State. </p>
							<p>The next loyalty is to his friends and local environment. This is destroyed by lowering his trust and bringing about reportings upon him allegedly by his fellows or the town or village authorities. The next is to his State and this, for the purposes of Communism, is the only loyalty which should exist once the state is founded as a Communist State. To destroy loyalty to the State all manner of forbiddings for youth must be put into effect so as to disenfranchise them as members of the Capitalist state and, by promises of a better lot under Communism, to gain their loyalty to a Communist movement.</p>
							<p>Denying a Capitalist country easy access to courts, bringing about and supporting propaganda to destroy home, creating and continuous juvenile delinquency, forcing upon the state all manner of practices to divorce the child from it will in the end create the chaos necessary to Communism.</p>
							<p>Under the saccharine guise of assistance to them, rigorous child labour laws are the best means to deny the child any right in the society. By refusing to let him earn, by forcing him into unwanted dependence upon a grudging parent, by making certain in other channels that the parent is never in other than economic stress, the child can be driven in his teens into revolt. Delinquency will ensue.</p>
							<p>By making readily available drugs of various kinds, by giving the teen-ager alcohol, by praising his wildness, by stimulating him with sex literature and advertising to him or her practices as taught at the Sexpol, the psychopolitical operator can create the necessary attitude of chaos, idleness and worthlessness into which can then be cast the solution which will give the teen-ager complete freedom everywhere &ndash; Communism.</p>
							<p>Should it be possible to continue conscription beyond any reasonable time by promoting unpopular wars and other means, the draft can always stand as a further barrier to the progress of youth in life, destroying any immediate hope to participate in his nations civil life.</p>
							<p>By these means the patriotism of youth for their Capitalistic flag can be dulled to a point where they are no longer dangerous as soldiers. While this might require many decades to effect, Capitalism's short term view will never envision the lengths across which we can plan.</p>
							<p>If we could effectively kill the national pride and patriotism of just one generation we will have won that country. Therefore there must be continual propaganda aboard to undermine the loyalty of the citizens in general and the teen-ager in particular.</p>
							<p>The role of the psychopolitical operator in this very strong. He can, from his position as an authority on the mind, advise all manner of destructive measures. He can teach the lack of control of this child at home. He can instruct, in an optimum situation, the entire nation in how to handle children &ndash; and instruct them so that the children, given no control, given no real home, can run wildly about with no responsibility for their nation or themselves.</p>
							<p>The mis-alignment of the loyalty of youth to a Capitalistic nation sets the proper stage for a realignment of their loyalties with Communism. Creating a greed for drugs, sexual misbehaviour and uncontrolled freedom and presenting this to them as a benefit of Communism will with ease bring about our alignment.</p>
							<p>In the case of strong leaders amongst youthful groups, a psychopolitical operator can work in many ways to
								<!-- use a --> discard that leadership. If it is to be used, the character of the girl or boy must be altered carefully into criminal channels and a control by blackmail or other means must be maintained. But where the leadership is not susceptible, where it resists all persuasions and might become dangerous to our Cause, no pains must be spared to direct the attention of the authorities to that person and to harass him in one way or another until he can come into the hands of juvenile authorities. When this has been effected it can be hoped that a psychopolitical operator, by reason of child adviser status can, in the security of the jail and cloaked by processes of law, destroy the sanity of that person. Particularly brilliant scholars, athletes and youth group leaders must be handled in either one of these two ways.
							</p>
							<p>In the matter of guiding the activities of juvenile courts, the psychopolitical operator entertains here one of his easier tasks.</p>
							<p>A Capitalistic nation is so filled with injustice in general that a little more passes without comment. In juvenile courts there are always persons with strange appetites whether these be judges or police men or woman. If such do not exist they can be created. By making available to them young boys or girls in the &quot;security&quot; of the jail or the detention home, and by appearing with flash cameras or witnesses, one becomes equipped with a whip adequate to direct all the future decisions of that person when these are needed.</p>
							<p>The handling of youth cases by courts should be led further and further away from law and further and further into &quot;mental problems&quot; until the entire nation thinks of &quot;mental problems&quot; instead of criminals. This places vacancies everywhere in the courts, in the offices of district attorneys and, on police staffs which could then be filled with psychopolitical operators, who become then the judges of the land by their influence, and into their hands comes the total control of the criminal, without whose help a revolution cannot ever be accomplished.</p>
							<p>By stressing this authority over the problems of the youth and adults in courts one day the demand for psychopolitical operators could become such that even the armed services will use &quot;authorities on the mind&quot; to work their various justices and when this occurs the armed forces of the nation then enter into our hands as solidly as if we commanded them ourselves. With the slight bonus of having thus a skilled interrogator near every technician or handler of secret war apparatus, the country, in event of revolution, as did Germany in 1918 and 1919 will find itself immobilized by its own Army and Navy fully and entirely in Communist hands.</p>
							<p>Thus the subject of loyalties and their re-alignment is in fact the subject of non-armed conquest of an enemy.</p>
