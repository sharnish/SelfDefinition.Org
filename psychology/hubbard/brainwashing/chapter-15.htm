							<p>There are certain damaging movements which could interrupt a psychopolitical conquest. These, coming from some quarters of the country, might gain headway and should be spotted before they do, and stamped out.</p>
							<p>Proposals may be made by large and powerful group in the country to return the insane to the care of those who have handled mental healing for tribes and populaces for centuries &ndash; the priest. Any movement to place clerygymen in charge of institutions should be fought on the grounds of incompetence and the insanity brought about by religion. The most destructive thing which could happen to a psychopolitical programme would be the investment of the ministry with the care of the nation's insane.</p>
							<p>If mental hospitals operated by religious group are in existence, the must be discredited and closed, no matter what the cost, for it might occur that the actual figures of recovery in such institutions would become known, and that the lack of recovery in general institutions might be compared to them, and this might lead to a movement to place the clergy in charge of the insane. Every argument must be advanced early, to overcome any possibility of this ever occurring.</p>
							<p>A country's law must carefully be made to avoid any rights of person to the insane. Any suggested laws or Constitutional Amendments which make the harming of the insane unlawful, should be fought to the extreme, on the ground that only violent measures can succeed. If the law were to protect the insane, as it normally does not, the entire psychopolitical programme would very possibly collapse.</p>
							<p>Any movements to increase or place under surveillance the orders required to hospitalized the mentally ill should be discouraged. This should be left entirely in the hand of person well under the control of psychopolitical operatives. It should be done with minimum formality, and no recovery of the insane from an institution should be possible by any process of law. Thus, any movement to add the legal steps of the processes of commitment and release should be discourage on the ground of emergency. To obviate this, the best action is to place a psychiatric and detention ward of the mentally ill in every hospital in a land.</p>
							<p>Any writing of a psychopolitical nature, accidentally disclosing themselves, should prevented. All actual literature on the subject of insanity and its treatment should be suppressed, first by actual security, and second by complex verbiage which renders it incomprehensible. The actual figures of recovery or death should never be announced in any papers. Any investigation attempting to discover whether or not psychiatry or psychology has ever cured anyone should immediately be discouraged and laughed to scorn, and should mobilize at that point all psychopolitical operatives. At first, it should be ignored, but if this is not possible, the entire weight of all psychopoliticians in the nation should be pressed into service. Any tactic possible should be employed to prevent this from occurring. To rebut it, technical appearing papers should exist as to the tremendous number of cures effected by psychiatry and psychology, and whenever possible, percentages of cures, no matter how fictitious, should be worked into legislative papers, thus forming a background of &quot;evidence&quot; which would immediately rebut any effort to actually discover anyone who had ever been helped by psychiatry or psychology.</p>
							<p>If the Communistic connections of a psychopolitician should become disclosed, it should be attributed to his own carelessness, and he should, himself, be immediately branded as eccentric within his own profession.</p>
							<p>Authors of literature which seek to demonstrate the picture of a society under complete mental control and duress should be helped toward infamy or suicide to discredit their works.</p>
							<p>Any literature liberalizing any healing practice should be immediately fought and defeated. All healing practices should gravitate entirely to authoritative levels, and no other opinions should be admitted, as these might lead to exposure.</p>
							<p>Movements to improve youth should be invaded and corrupted, as this might interrupt campaigns to produce in youth delinquency, addiction, drunkenness, and sexual promiscuity.</p>
							<p>Communist workers in the field of newspapers and radio should be protected wherever possible by striking out of action, through Psychopolitics, any persons consistently attacking them. These, in their turn, should be persuaded to give every possible publicity to the benefits of psychopolitical activities under the heading of &quot;science&quot;.</p>
							<p>No healing group devoted to the mind must be allowed to exist within the borders of Russia or its satellites. Only well-vouched-for psychopolitical operatives can be continued in their practice, and this only for the benefit of the government or against enemy prisoners.</p>
							<p>Any effort to exclude psychiatrists or psychologist from the armed services must be fought.</p>
							<p>Any inquest into the &quot;suicide&quot; or sudden mental derangement of any political leader in a nation must be conducted only by psychopolitical operatives or their dupes, whether Psychopolitics is responsible or not.</p>
							<p>Death and violence against persons attacking Communism in a nation should be eschewed as forbidden. Violent activity against such person might bring about their martyrdom. Defamation, and the accusation of insanity, alone should be employed, and they should be brought at last under the ministrations of psychopolitical operatives, such as psychiatrists and controlled psychologists.</p>
