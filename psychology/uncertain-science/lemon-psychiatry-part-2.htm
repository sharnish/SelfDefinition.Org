								Few doctors have had any training in psychiatry, and many are sceptical about its
								effectiveness.
							</p>
							<p>
								"You have to treat doctors as gingerly as you treat a patient," says Mrs. Morton
								Golden, who administers her psychiatrist husband's seminar series for doctors in
								Brooklyn Heights, N.Y. "The young doctors are too busy getting going to come to
								us, and it also seems to take about twenty years for the doctor to realize that
								there are patients he's not having success dealing with. When you first approach
								a general practitioner, you're dealing with a layman."
							</p>
							<p>
								Community psychiatry has even had its frustrations with psychiatrists. In a study
								of psychiatric agencies several years ago, Dr. John Curning and Dr. Claire Rudolph
								found that the agencies with the best-trained workers concentrated almost completely
								on mildly disturbed patients, and saw only a small percentage of severely disturbed
								people. Similarly, the agencies with the least-trained workers treated the most
								people and most of the severely disturbed. There are fewer members of the A.P.A.
								working in public hospitals today than there were when the organization had only
								4,000 members.
							</p>
							<p>
								"At least half psychiatry's energy today is going to people for whom treatment is
								essentially palliative," says San Mateo's Dr. Joseph Downing.
							</p>
							<p>
								"This means people who probably wouldn't be much different if they weren't treated
								at all. One of our big problems is the dog-in-the-manger attitude of most professionals,
								that even though they're overworked and can't do a job, nobody else can do it because
								they're not professionals."
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, of course, many of the places where the most ill are treated are unsuited
								to community psychiatry, which was a major reason for the creation of the community
								mental-health centre concept in the first place.
							</p>
							<p>
								The average U.S. mental hospital has 1,440 beds, compared to the non-psychiatric
								hospital average of 139. Some 452,000 Americans are being treated in 284 state and
								County mental hospitals, most of which are at least 45 years old; about 40 percent
								of these patients have been hospitalised for more than 10 years, and almost 30 percent
								of them are over 65 years old. The country's 259 private mental hospitals have 80,000
								patients and five times as many staff members per patient as the public hospitals,
								and the average stay in them is two months. Many of these private hospitals, like
								Menninger's, in Topeka, Kansas, and the Institute of Living, in Hartford, Connecticut,
								have supplied the profession's leaders, but many of the more conservative, less
								community-oriented voices in the profession also come from such hospitals. Today,
								still, there are 13 states with no private mental hospitals at all.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most community-oriented of all hospitals are probably the 1,005 general hospitals
								that have psychiatric units. General hospitals today actually treat more mental
								patients than do the state and county hospitals, and more of them have applied to
								become community mental-health centres than any other class of hospital. Nonetheless,
								even the general hospitals are a long way from the minimum standards laid down by
								the National Institute of Mental Health. Only a third of them have any social workers
								(the average mental-health centre has seven), and only a third offer any form of
								part-time hospitalisation.
							</p>
							<p>
								One vivid example of how far psychiatry has come in recent years, and of how far
								it still has to go, is an old, remote, unglamorous hospital in Orofino, Idaho, which
								serves the entire northern half of the state.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the summer of' 1939 a young premed student from California went up to Orofino's
								State Hospital North to work as an attendant. "It was a dumping ground," he recalled
								recently. "The big therapy was to push big blocks with carpeting on them, back and
								forth, to polish the floor. The place was staffed by bughousers &ndash; a floating
								population, like circus roustabouts &ndash; who worked in mental institutions. You've
								read the horrors about patients getting beaten up? &ndash; Well, the simple fact
								was, it worked. The other patients complain that they can't sleep because some guy
								is yelling, so you went in and beat him up for five minutes. You got a dry towel,
								never a wet one, and knotted it and beat him. If anybody came along later, there
								were no marks &ndash; maybe a skin rash, nothing else. There was one male nurse
								who was a sadist. He went in and beat up a patient badly with a towel. I went in
								and complained to the doctor. I remember he was sitting in the dark, listening to
								Jack Benny. Nothing ever happened."
							</p>
							<p>
								Ten years later, after a series of newspaper exposes about State Hospital North,
								the legislature appropriated money for two new buildings, but by 1956 conditions
								had still not improved much. That year, a psychiatrist named Dr. Myrick W. Pullen
								Jr., who was in private practice in Salt Lake City, heard from his father, a doctor
								in Boise, that State Hospital North was looking for a superintendent, so he went
								up to take a look.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The needs just stood out all over," he recalls. "And I knew I could run a place
								better than that." With no fancier mandate than that, Dr. Pullen became superintendent.
								"It was fantastic," he says. "The patients were working twelve hours a day, seven
								days a week. A lot of people were being held here just because they were good workers.
								People would say, 'You can't let Charlie go home for Christmas. Who'd collect the
								garbage?' Lock 'em up, keep 'em quiet, and work 'em was the treatment plan, by and
								large."
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Pullen is a quiet, unprepossessing father of six who favours pale sports jackets
								and keeps a Methodist hymnal on the upright piano in his parlour. He does not write
								papers, and he is not known to the leaders of his profession. Nonetheless, thanks
								to Dr. Pullen, northern Idaho has a very different hospital today. State Hospital
								North now has 278 patients instead of 435, and 108 of those were admitted before
								Dr. Pullen arrived. New patients generally get out in a little over a month, and
								can start trial home visits within two weeks. A family-care program places patients
								without relatives in a sponsor's home, and discharged patients are provided medicine
								at cost. Two thirds of the wards are open, and there are two sunny and cheerful
								self-management wards. There is a well-equipped new laboratory; a room with a see-through
								mirror and tape recorder, for group therapy; a lively recreational therapy shop.
							</p>
							<p>
							</p>
							<p>
								Two thousand feet up in the mountains, 17 miles from the hospital grounds, patients
								and staff members are building four A-frame houses as a self-sustaining camp for
								the hospital's most needy cases, its long-time patients. "We have some of the recreational
								advantages the rest of the country is crying for, and it would be nice to use them,"
								says Bernard Sargent, the young public health specialist who supervised the camp's
								founding. "If we can give these chronic patients a group identity, and set up a
								retreat that is realistic, not escapist, we may help some of them."
							</p>
							<p>
								State Hospital North is still not a model hospital. Orofino is set dramatically
								alongside the Clearwater River at the bottom of a deep, narrow, inaccessible valley,
								and it is hard to get psychiatrists and doctors to work there. Dr. and Mrs. Pullen
								have had two weeks vacation in 10 years, and Dr. Pullen uses his spare time travelling
								to professional meetings, to keep informed. "Many patients who come here could be
								treated in their communities," Mrs. Pullen says, "but there are no facilities.
							</p>
							<p>
								State Hospital North also carries the burden of its past. The old men's ward has
								a large sitting area furnished with a semicircle of chairs. Every day, 43 old men
								in overalls sit there, crying, muttering, gesturing to themselves, sucking toothless
								gums, and their meaningless jabber creates a susurrating noise like the fluttering
								of hundreds of moths. Some are incontinent, but they are always cleaned up right
								away. One old man sings over and over again, "I'm gonna quit, I'm gonna quit, I'm
								gonna quit."
							</p>
							<p>
								"These are a lot easier to take care of than most patients," says the old men's
								nurse, a short, energetic woman. "They're not nearly so demanding. They're all capable
								of feeding themselves. I like these little old men &ndash; there's something about
								them. This little guy is paretic. He's had syphilis of the central nervous system.
								He thinks he's God's gift to women. He has a girlfriend &ndash; he sits out with
								her and holds hands. This little guy who's singing, every once in a while I go tell
								him to be quiet or he'll wake the baby. I got a bunch of characters in here. It's
								more fun than a barrel of monkeys."
							</p>
							<p>
								Speaking of a patient in the old women's ward across the hall, Mrs, Pullen says,
								"I sat, down next to Pearl the other day and said, 'Pearl, how long have you been
								here?' and she said, 'Thirty-four years.'"
							</p>
							<p>
								Psychiatry has dramatically improved the way it treats its patients, in the years
								since Pearl went in, but Pearl is still there. Such patients are no longer considered
								hopeless, but their hope now lies not in humane treatment but in intensive therapy.
								The hard problem still facing the profession is this problem of therapy: what specifically
								to do to help the mentally ill shake off their invisible chains and thus, as Freud
								put it, return them to the common unhappiness.
							</p>
							<p>
								Of all the choices presented to psychiatrists in treating the mentally ill, one
								of the most basic is whether to deal with the patient individually or as a social
								being, in his surroundings &ndash; roughly, a choice between the classic medical
								approach and what is called the "problem of living" model. With its move out of
								isolation, psychiatry has also moved away from the medical model toward the social
								one.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the ripe paradoxes of this paradoxical profession is that, in the teeth of
								this shift, psychiatry's most important single treatment is still psychoanalysis,
								which is medically oriented, resolutely individual, and has changed hardly at all
								for 50 years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Psychoanalysis is by all odds the most complex, cumbersome, limited and time-consuming
								psychiatric treatment ever devised. Psychoanalytic treatment takes three or four
								years to complete, the patient must visit his analyst three to five times every
								week, and full treatment may cost as much as $30,000. But analysis has had little
								success with the severely disturbed, and many analysts use it on only a few of their
								patients.
							</p>
							<p>
								The few studies that have been made indicate that analysis, even with its selected
								clientele, succeeds only two thirds of the time, a rate not distinguishable from
								spontaneous recovery rates after no treatment at all. Analysis has therefore come
								under heavy attack from those who want to treat mental illness on a large scale
								or within a brief amount of time.

							<p>
								Freud is the only practitioner in the history of medicine, Dr. Garfield Tourney
								has written, to introduce a treatment which has "proved to be lengthier and lengthier,
								more expensive and applicable to fewer patients, with dubious results."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Analytical training slowed me down for five years," Dr. David Vail, chief of Minnesota's
								mental-health program says. "It's not only of little use in the world of everyday
								reality &ndash; it can actually cripple a psychiatrist's ability to deal with everyday
								reality. It's like trying to survey ground for a highway by using a microscope."
							</p>
							<p>
								Yet for all its limitations, analysis is still a powerful force in psychiatry. Half
								the heads of psychiatric divisions of medical schools are analytically trained.
								They tend to be the intellectuals of the profession and, often, the leaders of its
								organizations. Leading analysts in New York are finding themselves with unfilled
								appointment periods, but its general popularity with patients is still high. (One
								10-block section of Manhattan is so crowded with analysts that it is known as "The
								Mental Block," and its Beverly Hills equivalent is called "Couch Canyon.") Most
								important, whatever its therapeutic value, it is probably the best technique yet
								devised for revealing the hidden mind. "Saying that Freud is out," Dr. Kubie says
								impatiently, "is like saying Newton is out because Einstein came along."
							</p>
							<p>
								Of all psychiatric procedures, the technique of psychoanalysis is at once the most
								scientific and the most artistic. Analysis is the only psychiatric therapy with
								clearly established ground rules, and although there are many dissident schools,
								the majority of analysts still consider Freud's rules sacrosanct.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the same time, the application of those rules demands an ability to react spontaneously
								to the patient's material, much as the creative artist reacts to contact with the
								variables of life. The analyst must constantly decide whether to speak or keep silent,
								whether to suggest interpretations to the patient or wait for him to come to his
								own conclusions, and whether what the patient says is true or evasive, trivial or
								significant. To do that, the analyst tries to share the patient's feelings, then
								pull back to examine the feelings objectively in the light of analytic theory, clinical
								experience and his knowledge of the patient. For his part the patient is asked to
								alternate between free association and rational discussion, between total subjectivity
								and objective efforts to understand.
							</p>
							<p>
								Analysis is thus not a straight-line process, with the patient tossing out whatever
								comes into his head and the analyst explaining what it means, but a constant shuttling
								back and forth by both doctor and patient between expression and interpretation.
								The treatment part of this process is altogether indirect. "I wouldn't even speak
								of treating a case in psychoanalysis," Dr. Robert Waelder has said. "We study a
								case in psychoanalysis." Nevertheless, many analysts believe that their most successful
								colleagues are those with a strong desire to help people, and the cornerstone of
								analysis is the belief that study and understanding eventually lead to recovery.
							</p>
							<p>
								Each patient's mind presents a new continent for exploration, but it is a peculiarly
								tricky continent filled with mirages. The patient, a resident of this continent,
								is befuddled by these mirages: He puts on a bathing suit to go up a mountain because
								it appears to him as the ocean; he runs from flower's because they look like snakes;
								he becomes paralysed looking at an apple tree because it calls to his mind a forbidden
								grape arbour from his youth. Yet his conscious mind isn't aware of these misconceptions,
								so he can explain his actions only by saying that he finds mountain air warm or
								the smell of flowers overpowering or apples fearful. At first the analyst is as
								lost as the patient, and only through slow and careful tracking down of leads can
								he come to understand what lies behind the mirages and thus lead the patient to
								the same knowledge.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is no use to tell the patient a flower is not dangerous, because the patient
								already knows that. It is no use to tell him he sees a flower as a snake, because
								he will not be able to believe it. It is necessary first for the analyst to discover
								that flowers do appear to part of the patient's mind as snakes, then to find out
								what there is about flowers that causes them to appear as snakes that made them
								frightening in the first place and, finally, to lead the patient to the same discoveries.
							</p>
							<p>
								The ground rules for this difficult exploration were evolved by Freud from his own
								observations that certain basic formations are common to all men's minds. The part
								of the brain containing the unconscious instinctive drive Freud called the id. The
								largely conscious part of the brain Freud called the ego; its function is to mediate
								between the instinctive drives and the demands of reality. The third major &ndash;
								and largely unconscious &ndash; part of the brain Freud called the superego; this
								he described as a kind of policeman, or conscience, in which "the parental influence
								is prolonged."
							</p>
							<p>
								The ego pushes back any drives from the id which reality or the person's superego
								can not tolerate and this process of repression is what creates neuroses. It was
								Freud's belief that man is driven primarily by his love, or sexual, instinct and
								by an aggressive, destructive, death instinct and that all neuroses are created
								by a clash between the sexual instinct and the ego during childhood. The basis of
								psychoanalytic treatment is that what has in this way been rendered unconscious
								must be made conscious again, and when this has happened, the neurosis will disappear
							</p>
							<p>
								The existence of the unconscious is clearly established. Experiments have shown
								that if a man spends a few minutes in an unfamiliar room, and then is asked to list
								as many of the furnishings as he can, he will average 20 to 30 items, but if he
								is then hypnotized, he will be able to list as many as 200. Most people find this
								hidden mind fearful and even shameful. Carl Jung spoke of the widespread "panic
								fear of the discoveries that might be made in the realm of the unconscious," and
								Freud himself once told Jung that he had made his sexual theories into dogma as
								a bulwark against a possible "outburst of the black flood of occultism." <sup>[1]</sup>
								Even today most laymen are far happier with the idea that there may be a chemical
								cause for mental illness. "People would prefer a physical diagnosis," says Dr. Robert
								Buckley of Los Angeles. "Even a brain tumour."

							</p>
							<p>
								A great limitation of psychoanalysis is that a confrontation with the unconscious
								mind is not always feasible &ndash; or even desirable. The physical symptoms of
								hysteria are often a last-ditch effort to ward off an unbearable mental showdown,
								and patients have been cured of hysterical paralysis and committed suicide the night
								of their recovery.
							</p>
							<p>
								Freud discovered that if a patient simply let his mind roam and then reported the
								associations that emerged patterns would be revealed which could be discovered in
								no other way. Free association is thus a means by which the unconscious speaks &ndash;
								dreams are another &ndash; and the patient free associates for most of the analytic
								hour.
							</p>
							<p>
								The major tool of the analyst is interpretation of these associations, but even
								interpretation must await confrontation: The analyst cannot suggest what a fear
								may mean until the patient has admitted having it. Then, if the interpretation is
								correct, it will produce fresh material, new recollections and further interpretation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The barriers put up by the patient's ego to prevent this uncovering are called resistances.
								A resistance may be conscious or unconscious; in general, it is anything that blocks
								free association or insight. Resistance is present at every step, and is always
								the first thing to be analysed, although most analysts let minor resistances go
								by the board to avoid turning exploration into prosecution.
							</p>
							<p>
								Resistance is often artful and hard to detect, but it can also betray itself in
								some familiar ways. A patient who talks at length about trivial things is probably
								avoiding something, and so is one who talks constantly about either the past or
								the present. Figures of speech like "honestly" and "really and truly" suggest their
								opposites, and a patient who talks blandly but squirms and wiggles is probably not
								telling the whole story. Clenched hands and locked ankles are figurative signs that
								something is being held back.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Ralph Greenson tells of one patient, a highly
								intelligent professor, who always reported his dreams by starting in the middle
								and jumping around. It turned out that the man also began reading books in the middle,
								had always done homework from the middle or end, and studied walking or lying down.
								The professor's father had been a famous teacher and had groomed the son to follow
								in his steps. The professor had felt great love for his father, mixed with deep
								hostility and jealousy and a fear of being swallowed up by his dominating parent.
								His love had been expressed in following the, father's career; the need to rebel
								had been expressed in his odd ways of going about it.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most crucial and curious phenomenon of analysis is known as transference. In
								transference a person in the present &ndash; the analyst &ndash; is reacted to as
								though he were a person from the patient's past, usually father, mother, sister
								or brother. By unconsciously reviving this past figure the patient re-experiences
								during treatment the significant but repressed events of his past. Transference
								occurs because an ill person tends to re-experience emotions instead of remembering
								them, and the psychiatrist encourages the development of a transference so that
								the patient will be able to look at this mirror version of old relationships.
							</p>
							<p>
								The subtle and much misunderstood process by which the patient recovers hidden childhood
								emotions is called reconstruction. "We are misled if we believe that we are, except
								in rare instances, able to find the 'events' of the afternoon on the staircase when
								the seduction happened," Dr. Ernst Kris has written. "We are dealing with the whole
								period in which the seduction played a role." Analysis does not so much attempt
								to recapture the feelings and reactions of this period as to reconstruct a facsimile
								of them, but even a taste of old feelings can produce extreme regression: patients
								may shout, curse and weep, and psychotic reactions sometimes occur.
							</p>
							<p>
								The last stage of analysis is called "working-through," and it is the slow process
								of removing resistances which have not been affected by insight. Much of working-through
								takes place outside the office.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most subtle aspect of psychoanalysis is probably the relationship between the
								analyst and the patient. During this delicate relationship, the analyst's notorious
								couch serves as a specific tool to expedite free association. The act of lying down
								is infantilising; it makes the patient's thinking looser and more pictorial. (It
								is hard to give one's mind free rein while staring a doctor in the face, and the
								sense of isolation on the couch, with the doctor out of sight, creates a strain
								which brings feelings to the fore.) For his part, the analyst listens to the uncensored
								flow of thoughts with what is often called "free-floating attention." He uses his
								own reactions as a major guide, and many psychoanalysts believe that their own unconscious
								insights are more important to them than their intelligence.

								"If things get boring, and I get sleepy," says one New York City analyst, "it's

								At the same time, the analyst absents himself as an individual from the proceedings
								is much as possible. His blankness lets the unreality of the patient's reactions
								be demonstrated; if his own personality becomes involved, he injects a complicating
								element into the transference. "The doctor should be opaque to his patients," Freud
								wrote, "and, like a mirror, should show them nothing but what is shown to him."
							</p>
							<p>
								The specifics of successful analytic cases are as varied as individual personalities,
								but they share a common quality &ndash; a painful, seemingly interminable peeling
								away of emotional coverings.
							</p>
							<p>
								In New York, a depressed, masochistic mother of two began analysis because of the
								realization that she seemed to need to make herself feel unhappy and badly used.
								She had greatly admired her two younger brothers, who she felt were her parents'
								favourites and who frequently showed off for her intellectually and artistically,
								and during the first year of analysis she gained psychological insight into her
								resultant feelings of deprivation. But the insight left her in times of stress,
								and the analyst felt that her treatment was going around in circles. Then he noticed
								that, during analysis, the woman went through an odd and unvarying ritual. She would
								relate a dream or incident, then lapse into a dreamy silence and wait, her head
								slightly turned and her mouth open, in anticipation of an interpretation. If he
								gave one, she would say it was marvellous, a brilliant deduction, and comment on
								her own stupidity. Then she would say she felt depressed. He would interpret her
								depression, and the routine would begin again.
							</p>
							<p>
								The analyst decided to concentrate his interpretations not on what she said but
								on her state and behaviour. For the first time his observations were not met with
								cheers. The woman complained that he was making her feel uncomfortable, accused
								him of losing interest in her, and said treatment wasn't getting anywhere, He suggested
								that she was angry because he had interfered with the dreamy state in which, both
								in treatment and outside it, she experienced a kind of passive sexual excitement.
							</p>
							<p>
								The next day the woman reported a nightmare involving a male figure, from her childhood,
								and the details led the analyst to ask whether she had ever had a childhood experience
								with an exhibitionist. She suddenly recalled a forgotten incident, which she had
								been too ashamed to tell anybody about, of mutual fondling with a young man when
								she was eight. The analyst suggested that her state during this incident was the
								same dreamy one in which she had admired the exhibitions of her brothers and now
								of the analyst, and that her subsequent depressions duplicated the shame she had
								felt after the fondling. The woman thereafter improved considerably, with only occasional
								spells of depression, and the analyst decided to end treatment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Three months before the anlysis was to end, the woman had a third child. Her mother
								came to help her for a month, then left to visit one of the patient's brothers.
								The woman took up an old habit of compulsive eating, gained a lot of weight, and
								then went on a crash diet. At that point a snowstorm prevented her from keeping
								two successive appointments.
							</p>
							<p>
								When she next came in her appearance was unkempt, she spoke stuporously and moved
								haltingly and clumsily. She was depressed and full of complaints about household
								drudgeries. The analyst said she looked less like an overworked housewife than a
								neglected child, and the woman started to cry. Then she reported a recent dream
								in which she was locked out of her parents' house. The analyst suggested that she
								looked and acted the way she must have at 19 months when her mother gave birth to
								her brother and thus "left" the patient for her brother, as she had left after the
								recent birth of the patient's third child.

							</p>
							<p>He suggested that the crash diet repeated
								a childhood hunger strike, and that the snowstorm that kept her from the analyst
								had made her aware that still another relationship was about to be broken off, and
								that she would once again be replaced, by another patient. She was re-experiencing
								the same envious, hurt reaction to being locked out that she had known as a child.
								The woman became brighter, and confessed that she had recently been preoccupied
								with thoughts that maybe, when she left, the analyst would treat her brother, who
								had been considering analysis. The insight was worked through, her depression vanished,
								and treatment was ended. The essential factor, the analyst concluded, was not the
								recollection of childhood events but the reconstruction of the childhood emotions.
							</p>
							<p>
								Analysis is the most difficult of all therapies to evaluate, but many of its current
								troubles seem due to factors which have nothing to do with the treatment itself.
								"The three men who have caused the greatest blows to man's esteem are Copernicus,
								Darwin and Freud," Dr. Greenson has remarked, and analysts from Freud on down have
								believed, that the field has often been attacked because it probes an area which
								most people would like left alone. In addition, analysis attempts to reconstruct
								the personality, which, sounds as alarming to most people as a proposal to redesign
								the flag, Evangelical patients may also have hurt the profession. "I think analysis
								has suffered more from its friends than its enemies," Dr. Greenson says, "because
								many of its so-called friends are insufficiently analysed patients."
							</p>
							<p>
								The vogue of analysis among creative people, especially actors, has also created
								a mistaken impression that it is a kind of pacifier for the temperamental. "All
								artists are disposed toward neurosis, or their creativity is a substitute for neurosis
								&ndash; you see both," Dr. Greenson says. "But actors are, I would say, among the
								least rewarding of patients. People who get too much acclaim tend to develop narcissism,
								and there's a premium on being infantile in the movies. It's pretty rough to try
								to get somebody to have a sense of reality when he's getting a million, a million
								and a half bucks per picture."
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, analysts themselves tend to be quarrelsome and prone to dogmatism, and
								they often put their worst foot forward. The size of their judgments often seems
								in inverse proportion to the amount of the evidence. Many analysts, including Freud,
								have made large judgments about famous people they have not met, and it is not uncommon
								for analysts to dismiss their critics as emotionally unbalanced. Yet many analysts
								also like to compile reams of minutiae about their patients, from which they are
								able to deduce almost nothing. One recent analytical paper was entitled, "The Effect
								of a Change in the Analyst's Visage Upon Transference," and dealt with the effect
								on his patients when an analyst came back from vacation sporting a beard. The paper
								concluded that there wasn't any important effect, although one patient briefly wanted
								to call the whole thing off.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most serious charge against analysts &ndash; and it has been made by some leaders
								of the profession &ndash; is that they have been unwilling to try to modify a cumbersome
								procedure. Dr. Leo Rangell, a past president of the American Psychoanalytic Association,
								has spoken of the "definite and discernible period of decline" of the specialty,
								and he blames it in part on analysts' haphazard approach to research and their lack
								of "creative, imaginative, or free thinking." At one convention Dr. Robert Waelder
								was asked whether analysis could be shortened. "It still takes nine months to have
								a baby," he answered, and the audience of analysts burst into applause.
							</p>
							<p> "I am amazed
								at Bob Waelder for hauling out that old chestnut," Dr. Karl Menninger told the audience.
								"I think it's a ridiculous metaphor. There's a presumptuousness about it that assumes
								that in some divine way we analysts are presiding over a process as immutable as
								reproduction." Dr. Menninger got no applause.
							</p>
							<p>
								While analysts study the mind to produce insight, psychotherapists generally manipulate
								and direct in order to change behaviour, and individual psychotherapy follows no
								rigid pattern. Treatment may be given twice a week or twice a month, and it may
								last anywhere from ten or 15 visits to several years. The patient generally sits
								facing the therapist, partly because severely ill patients need to maintain relations
								with another person and couldn't stand the isolation of the couch, and partly because
								free association is too slow for a limited schedule.

							</p>
							<p>
								Talk about the past is apt
								to be discouraged, and the therapist focuses the discussion on the most sensitive
								areas, interpreting as much as possible. Some drug use is often essential, and advice
								and counselling are fundamental to treatment. Where the analyst encourages transference,
								the psychotherapist discourages or manipulates it. Where the analyst is blank, the
								psychotherapist's opinions and reactions are an open part of treatment. Where the
								analyst interprets resistances, the psychotherapist evades them, or overcomes them,
								or strengthens them to keep the patient from slipping into a psychotic state.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are a number of specific schools with rules of their own. In the Adlerian
								school, the psychotherapist tries to find out what the patient's "life-style" is
								and what function his disorder serves. In transactional therapy, the doctor intentionally
								assumes attitudes or roles toward the patient in order to manipulate, for therapeutic
								effect, the "transaction" taking place between him and the patient. In nondirective
								therapy he neither manipulates nor interprets, but offers acceptance and a climate
								of understanding to liberate the patient's emotions and latent capacities.
							</p>
							<p>
								The wildest therapy of all is probably that of Dr. James L. McCartney, an A.P.A.
								member for more than 30 years. Dr. McCartney has written that a female patient needs
								to work out her libidinal drives if she is to reach maturity, and so he has personally
								obliged over a hundred female patients with sex play, ranging all the way from lap-sitting
								to sexual intercourse.
							</p>
							<p>
								The various forms of individual psychotherapy, taken together, probably form the
								largest category of treatment today, and even many analysts are using shorter therapies
								on most of their patients. The patients of one leading New York analyst, on a typical
								11-hour day, included a newly remarried woman suffering from guilt about her divorce,
								an unfaithful wife suffering guilt and anxiety, a college girl, a college boy, a
								foreign student, an old woman suffering from depression, a homosexual boy with cancer,
								and a businessman with a tendency toward alcoholism. Only the unfaithful wife and
								the college girl were receiving formal analysis. The rest were getting counselling
								or psychotherapy.
							</p>
							<p>
								A patient's treatment is often limited as much by his own expectations as by the
								therapist's conviction, and one of the deciding factors may be the patient's attitude
								toward drugs and self-examination. "In one Bronx clinic, psychiatrists treating
								poor people find that they want to get a pill from a doctor," Dr. Campbell says.
								"Here in Greenwich Village we get a lot of hippies and beats, and they know more
								psychiatric theory than my residents do. They'll take a pill only if the effects
								are incidental. If it starts making them feel better, they want to stop, because
								they aren't getting any insight."
							</p>
							<p>
								In almost every respect, treatment with psychotherapeutic drugs is unlike treatment
								by either analysis or psychotherapy. Mind drugs work rapidly, sometimes almost instantly.
								Their effectiveness is clear and measurable, but they give no insight, and there
								is little knowledge about how they work. Drugs have proved ineffective against hysteria,
								and they are very rarely given during formal analysis. Nevertheless, 82 percent
								of this country's psychiatrists say that they use drugs, and the true percentage
								may actually be even higher since psychiatrists may unconsciously play down their
								reliance on drugs. (One survey showed that 92 percent of all analysts use drugs
								at least occasionally when treating schizophrenia.) Pure drug treatment, without
								accompanying therapy, is relatively rare, but there are few therapies today in which
								drugs do not play an important part.
