I have an article from Readers Digest in 1968, and the title is “Does Psychiatry work?” They’re talking about the percentage of the people who have to return to the mental institution after being released – meaning that the people who were treating them didn’t have the proper system. That is, they’ve got all sorts of tools, but still they didn’t get to the root trouble.

<blockquote>

“Such observations have convinced many psychiatrists that their proper study is not specific diseases like schizophrenia, but the whole man, who has developed a harmful way of reacting to his life and to himself.

And then he goes on to say that the group therapy, milieu therapy  and social therapy – these are the things that they’re substituting, instead of sitting down with the guy and saying, “Here’s what’s wrong with you, take such and such a pill.” Which means that people are going back to curing themselves. They put them in a group of people – and I know personally a lot of these groups who have done exactly that; they just throw them together and say, “Let’s see what comes out.” Well, the result of all this expensive supervision has been, “Since 1955 the number of Americans admitted to mental hospitals has risen four times faster than the population.”  For any increase in the population, the increase in demand for admission to these institutions is outdistancing it four times.
