							<p>
								Since Hippocrates's time, man has sought an organic explanation for his troubling
								emotions, and during the past 15 years he has often seemed on the verge of finding
								it. He has not yet succeeded, although there are scientists who think he will.
							</p>
							<p>
								What he has acquired instead is a large, steadily growing number of drugs which
								cure nothing, but which relieve symptoms and make the mentally ill accessible to
								other forms of therapy.
							</p>
							<p>
								These drugs fall into four main categories. <span class="note">[as of 1968]</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								There are the derivatives of chlorpromazine, which relieve excitement and confusion.
								There are the tranquillisers, mostly derived from meprobamate, which calm agitation
								and relieve anxiety. There are the amphetamines, commercially marketed as Dexedrine,
								Benzedrine, and so on &ndash; which relieve the symptoms of depression. And there
								is a large group, the M.A.0. inhibitors and imipramine, which are basic anti-depressants.
							</p>
							<p>
								One fourth to one third of all prescription written today are for these psychoactive
								drugs, but, like most revolutions, the new drugs have also created problems. A number
								of psychiatrists are concerned about the extensive use of such drugs, especially
								tranquillisers. "What most people need," Dr. Menninger has said, "is not to care
								less, but to care more."
							</p>
							<p>
								The mind drugs have proved less effective at keeping patients out of hospitals than
								at getting them out once they are in, partly because many patients get careless
								about taking the drugs, but also, some psychiatrists believe, because some psychiatrists
								and many general practitioners, who often take care of discharged patients, are
								not sufficiently skilful at prescribing mind drugs.
							</p>
							<p>
								A tranquilliser whose side effect is to increase sexual appetite, for example, would
								be inadvisable for an anxious woman suffering from feelings of guilt. Yet very little
								psychopharmacology is taught in medical schools; doctors get much of their knowledge
								of mind drugs after graduation, from the drug companies, and many psychiatrists
								are critical of the extravagant claims made by some companies.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most ironic side effect of the drugs is that their use has proved markedly less
								satisfying to most psychiatrists than other, more creative therapies.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Nathan Kline, director of the research unit at Rockland (N.Y.) State Hospital,
								is, one of America's leaders In the field of, chemotherapy and also one of the bluntest
								critics of the way it is being practiced. While treating with drugs Dr. Kline has
								written, a psychiatrist may find out "that the patient's wife is sexually unresponsive
								or that he has intermittent spastic colitis or that he dreams about zebras. If the
								I.Q., education, income or social class of the patient approximates or surpasses
								that of the therapist, the probability is that he will be found in need of long-term
								intensive therapy." But if the patients are poor, dull or uneducated, Dr. Kline
								says, no one "presses them about their dream life, their wife's responsibility,
								or the condition of their gut," and they are counselled to accept their problems.
							</p>
							<p>
								He is particularly critical of the tendency to downgrade chemotherapy as an auxiliary
								procedure, thereby discouraging its development. Therapy cases are generally taken
								by the senior staff members in hospitals, while drug treatment is left to the most
								junior. "Drug treatment," Kline has concluded, "is routinely given to second-class
								patients by second-class doctors."
							</p>
							<p>
								The modern drug revolution began in 1951, with the introduction of chlorpromazine
								and later reserpine. That year 10 patients who had not responded to any therapy,
								including insulin and electric shock, were given chlorpromazine, and seven of them
								showed marked improvement or tentative recovery. When reserpine was given to 150
								chronically disturbed patients who had responded to no other therapies, 84 percent
								were declared improved, and 21 percent could be discharged. About 70 percent of
								the discharged patients maintained their improvement even after reserpine was discontinued.
								(Most patients will relapse, some almost instantly, if chlorpromazine is withdrawn,
								but they then respond well to lesser doses of the drug.)
							</p>
							<p>
								The principal effects of chlorpromazine are to eliminate hallucinations, improve
								judgment, and bring the patient to recognize the unreality of his previous feelings.
								There is still no real knowledge of how the drug does these things. It is believed,
								however, that both chlorpromazine and reserpine block the emotional circuit in the
								hypothalamus and thereby reduce fear, anger and excitement. In the same way, the
								anti-depressant amphetamines and M.A.0. inhibitors are believed to stimulate the
								hypothalamus, and thus enhance excitement, activity and pleasure.
							</p>
							<p>
								Other chemical substances in recent years have seemed to promise clearer insights
								into the workings of the mind, but the promises have not been fulfilled. LSD produces
								many strikingly schizophrenic-like reactions, but research to date has been inconclusive,
								and the similarities are generally considered coincidental.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most controversial biochemical claims have been made by Dr. Abram Hoffer, <sup>[1]</sup>
								director of psychiatric research at the University Hospital in Saskatchewan, Canada,
								who in 1966 reported that the drug niacin had within three to five days erased symptoms
								of schizophrenia in 13 out of 17 patients, all of whom had been institutionalised
								for many years. A separate study, under the sponsorship of the American College
								of Neuropsychopharmacology, was made of Dr. Hoffer's claims. The doctors found no
								consistent differences between a group receiving niacin and a group getting a placebo.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abram_Hoffer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abram_Hoffer</a>
								]
							</p>
							<p>
								Nonetheless, Dr. Hoffer and Dr. Humphry Osmond <sup>[2]</sup> have founded the American
								Schizophrenia Foundation, <sup>[3]</sup> one purpose of which is to arouse public
								support and solicit donations for niacin research. A booklet called <em>What You Should
									Know About Schizophrenia,</em> <span class="note">[14 pages]</span> published
								by the foundation for the public, flatly defines schizophrenia as "a physical disease,"
								and says that "a large body of scientific evidence" indicates that the schizophrenic
								is a victim of a 'metabolic error' in the chemistry of his body." <sup>[4]</sup>
								Dr. Hoffer's critics challenge his claims and his methods of publicizing them, but
								the issue may not be decided until completion of a half-million dollar government-sponsored
								test of niacin at Marlboro State Hospital in New Jersey. <sup>[5]</sup>

							<p>
								Besides the mind drugs, three other organic methods of treating mental illness have
								had wide use in recent years: the prefrontal lobotomy, Insulin-coma therapy, and
								electric-shock treatment.
							</p>
							<p>
								The prefrontal lobotomy, in which nerve fibres connecting the frontal lobes with
								the rest of the brain are surgically severed, first came into use in the 1940's,
								and during the next 15 years the operation was performed on more than 20,000 people,
								many of whom had been judged incurable. In one report of 604 lobotomised patients
								in the United States, 401 were judged either substantially improved or recovered.
								There is little understanding of just how the operation works, but its effect is
								to reduce the violence of the patient's mental conflict. However, it may also produce
								complacency, a loss of interest in the feelings of others, and a loss of imagination
								and sensitivity. The operation is not common today.
							</p>
							<p>
								Insulin-coma therapy, introduced in 1927, employs Insulin to put the patient into
								a deep sleep and then into a coma for roughly half an hour, The danger here is that
								the induced coma may prove irreversible &ndash; and therefore fatal. The treatment
								has generally been abandoned in favour of electric shock.
							</p>
							<p>
								Electric-shock treatment, in which convulsions are induced in an anaesthetised patient
								by means of an electric charge across the frontal area of the brain, has been widely
								replaced by the use of drugs. Nonetheless, 91 percent of U.S. general hospitals
								report that they use electric shock occasionally or frequently. (The same percentage
								use drugs frequently.) One private hospital in Colorado is said to use electric
								shock on 90 percent of its patients.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I'm scared every time I give electric shock, and I stay scared until it's over,"
								a psychiatrist in Idaho has said. "I still find convulsions terrible to watch."
								Nonetheless, the unconscious patient experiences no pain, and the physical hazards
								are not considered great. The treatment is given in series, and its effect is to
								temporarily impair memory and relieve depression, but there is no sure knowledge
								of how it works. One theory is that the shock is a massive attack on the patient's
								entire system, forcing it to organize and respond. Another theory is that by temporarily
								blocking memory, it allows, new ways of reacting to develop. Another is that the
								process satisfies a need for punishment; still another is that it makes the patient
								temporarily dependent on the doctors and thus speeds up therapy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since the introduction of the mind drugs, electric shock has most often been given
								to severely depressed patients with suicidal tendencies. A depressed patient is
								likely to try suicide not at his lowest point, when he is virtually unable to function,
								but after he has started up out of the depression, when he is capable of organizing
								an attempt. Drugs bring the depressed patient up relatively slowly, over a period
								of weeks, while shock brings him quickly past this critical period. The greatest
								danger of electric shock is the risk of permanent dullness, and the treatment is
								generally used, in the words of Dr. Sidney Cohen, "when the risk of keeping people
								in depression is greater than the risk of permanent shock."
							</p>
							<p>
								It is easy to forget that psychiatry is still a young and changing profession. Freud
								died in 1939, Jung in 1961. Electric-shock therapy and Insulin-coma therapy were
								considered major advances in the '30's, and the lobotomy was considered a major
								advance in the '40's and early '50's, and all are now in moderate to infrequent
								use. It is impossible to foresee what such a profession will be like even 10 years
								ahead, but the most basic change during psychiatry's past decade has clearly been
								the increase of interest in what is called the "problem of living" approach to mental
								illness. Analysis, psychotherapy and the chemical and physical therapies all treat
								the patient alone, in the traditional medical way. The social therapies, whether
								out of conviction or necessity, approach him as a social creature who cannot profitably
								be treated in isolation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The various social therapies are often dissimilar in execution, but they share a
								tendency to treat patients in groups and a tendency to emphasize the present over
								the past. At the most innovative end of the social-therapy spectrum are those psychiatrists
								who tend to favour much shorter treatment and the use of briefly trained personnel,
								working under a psychiatrist's guidance.

							<p>
								Each form of social therapy has its critics and its clear-cut dangers. Dr. Lawrence
								Kubie has noted that the shortest treatment is not invariably the best one, and
								that an insufficiently treated patient can create havoc in a family. ("Instead of
								curing one person, you've wrecked four," the husband of one prematurely discharged
								woman told her psychiatrist.) Traditional psychiatrists tend to feel that the shelter
								of a hospital is more beneficial than the pressurized world that produced an illness,
								and some who applaud the broad approach are concerned over the growing tendency
								to turn such treatment over to non-psychiatrists.
							</p>
							<p>
								The overriding feeling of many &ndash; and perhaps most &ndash; psychiatrists today
								is that individual treatment cannot cope with the amount of mental illness that
								exists. The Menninger complex, which has trained one out of every 20 U.S. psychiatrists,
								and includes one of the most prestigious hospitals in the world, has 80 doctors
								for its 200 patients, but only one or two patients are ever in analysis, only one
								third are in any form of individual psychotherapy and all are in milieu therapy.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Direct, individual treatment will never be the answer," says Dr. Roy Menninger,
								president of the Menninger Foundation and son of the late Will Menninger, Karl's
								brother. "We'll never have the resources. Our focus is away from the individual
								and onto the networks &ndash; the family, the Friday-night bridge club, work."
							</p>
							<p>
								In many other hospitals, less amply staffed, the social therapies are a matter of
								necessity, and they are often closely tied to community mental health programs.
								At the San Mateo Community Mental Health Centre in California, each patient has
								11 group therapy sessions a week, families are encouraged to visit ("Nothing de-institutionalises
								a place more than having a couple of little kids running around," says one doctor),
								and the community plays a vital role.
							</p>
							<p>
								"We get a minimum of anxiety about going back to the community, because walking
								out the door doesn't terminate the support a patient gets from the program," says
								Dr. Richard Levy. "Because we have a lot of resources in the community, we can focus
								on what strengths the patient has. If all you looked at was the magnitude of the
								illness, you'd be overwhelmed. You don't just say, 'He's a paranoid.' You say, 'Yes,
								but he can hold a job.' I've been amazed at the very sick people who go and get
								good, responsible jobs, and do them well."
							</p>
							<p>
								Of all the social therapies the most pragmatic is group therapy, which consists
								simply of a group of patients discussing their feelings and problems, with a psychiatrist
								acting chiefly as a referee. (In some groups the psychiatrist is more active; if
								a patient shows signs of transference in dealing with other group members, the psychiatrist
								points that out and discusses it.) More than half of the country's general hospitals
								now use group therapy, usually as an auxiliary treatment, and for many non-hospitalised
								patients it is the only treatment. In marathon therapy, group therapy is carried
								on for as long as 30 or 40 hours, during which familiarity and fatigue tend eventually
								to break down all resistances and barriers.
							</p>
							<p>
								The unique power of group therapy is its ability to bring problems out into the
								open. The members of a group are all equal, the session itself is close to real
								life, and reactions come not from one person but from many. The patient is both
								a participant and a therapist, and his usefulness to others increases his self respect.
								The most important single characteristic of successful group therapy is the patient's
								realization that problems he thought were unique and shameful are in fact shared
								by other people. The benefits may be far reaching. In one striking experiment, patients
								suffering from peptic ulcers who were given group therapy improved far more than
								a control group given the same medical treatment but no group therapy. Furthermore,
								80 percent of the group therapy patients had maintained their improvement three
								years later, while most of the control group relapsed within three months.
							</p>
							<p>
								While group therapy treats patients in terms of the outside world, family therapy
								brings the outsiders directly into treatment. Family therapy may be group therapy
								with relatives, or individual therapy applied to all members of a family at once.
								(In multiple-family therapy four to six families are treated at once; this is said
								to break down the barriers that a single family may throw up against a therapist.)
								Mental illness is contagious and seldom isolated, and some families are able to
								remain stable only by assigning one member to be sick; it is common for one member
								of a family to get better only to have another break down. Family therapy is often
								an analytic exploration dealing in resistances, transference and interpretation,
								but the focus often shifts from person to person as treatment progresses.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Alfred Messer, a professor of psychiatry at Emory University, has reported the
								results of family therapy for a 30-year-old bachelor who had made no progress after
								four and a half years of analysis. The patient told Dr. Messer on his first visit
								that he had reached an intellectual understanding of his troubles through analysis,
								but that it hadn't helped him any. As the family treatment progressed, its focus
								shifted gradually to the relationship between the young man and his father, and
								finally the father became the principal patient. He was a strong, self-made man,
								whose own father had deserted his family. He could not tolerate competition, and
								it gradually became clear that he completely dominated the son. One day, while describing
								how he had helped an associate whose father had turned away from him, he suddenly
								burst into tears, astonishing his son, his wife and himself. Eventually the man
								became aware of his bitterness against his father and his resultant difficulty in
								risking affection for his own son. Dr. Messer concluded that the original patient
								had been so humiliated by his father's domination that no treatment could work until
								the relationship had been straightened out.
							</p>
							<p>
								By far the broadest of all the social therapies is milieu therapy, <sup>[6]</sup> which knocks
								down all barriers between life and treatment. Milieu therapy consists of the manipulation
								of the patient's environment, and treatment in terms of that environment. "Everything
								that happens gets looked at," Dr. Roy Menninger has said. "Each person is examined
								in terms of various sectors, work, play, learning, creativity." At the Menninger
								hospitals the patient's activities are tailored to his troubles: for example, a
								bank president may be put to work scrubbing walls as a means of venting his need
								to punish himself.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[6. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieu_therapy">
									en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieu_therapy</a>
								]
							</p>
							<p>
								A far more controversial form of milieu therapy is the one in use at the Fort Logan
								Community Mental Health Centre, a cheerful, seven-year-old state hospital on the
								rural edge of Denver, Colorado. Fort Logan is probably the most controversial and
								avant-garde public hospital in America. The hospital has no locked wards; it simply
								discharges uncooperative patients. The therapeutic benefit comes almost entirely
								from group activities; there is virtually no individual therapy. The staff works
								in teams, all members of which are considered equal, and a psychiatrist may do less
								direct work with patients than a social worker or psychiatric technician.
							</p>
							<p>
								Physically, Fort Logan could be a high school or small college. Its campus is roomy
								and green, its rooms are colourful and cheerful, its few security measures are invisible,
								and its staff wears street clothes. A few years ago the hospital made a movie in
								which a fearful incoming patient pictured herself behind bars, watched over by stern,
								white-coated attendants. The white coats had to be borrowed from the state hospital
								at Pueblo, and the bars were oven racks from Fort Logan's stoves.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Fort Logan program is based on the "therapeutic-community" concept which Dr.
								Maxwell 0. Jones, a Scotsman, devised while working with English veterans during
								World War 11. In this community each staff team consists of a psychiatrist, a psychologist,
								two social workers, a head nurse, an activities therapist, six registered nurses
								and seven psychiatric technicians, and everyone is subject to analysis and criticism.
								The psychiatrists are not presumed to be more authoritative than anybody else, and
								since many of them have rebelled at this circumscribed role, there has been a high
								turnover in the psychiatric staff. Fort Logan believes, however, in the theory that
								water will find its own level, and that all its staff members will come to function
								in accordance with their abilities and experience.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fort Logan's patients are given varying degrees of freedom and are offered a share
								in decisions, among them passing on fellow patients' applications for increased
								privileges. The hospital's restrictions come from its group approach.
							</p>
							<p>
								In some groups every activity is compulsory for all, and some patients complain
								of a lack of solitude. Responsibility is demanded. "We say, 'You came here because
								you needed help, so you don't have to act crazy to let us know you need it,"' a
								social worker explains. "'We expect you to help the man next to you. And if you should
								break one of the community's rules, your behaviour affects the whole group, because
								the whole group will be punished.'"
							</p>
							<p>
								Fort Logan's re-admission rate has been climbing, and so has the number of its long-term
								patients, but its recovery rate and its confidence are still high. "I think the
								enthusiasm of the staff is a result of the team approach," says Dr. Alan Kraft,
								a former director. "In larger institutions you don't feel your importance. The traditionalists'
								argument with Fort Logan is often intense &ndash; there's a feeling of&nbsp;'What right
								have you to question what we're doing? Aren't you patriotic?' Well, individual psychiatry
								is one tool. But to pick the cream of the crop, to take those people off in a corner
								&ndash; this is criminal. It's inexcusable. At Fort Logan the psychiatrist has thirty-eight
								arms and nineteen heads.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I have a private practice, and there I am for personality reorganization. I see
								very little of the patient's behaviour, and I assume his behaviour is intact. My
								attention is on his psyche, and he has to identify his problems. At Fort Logan the
								goal is social rehabilitation. If the patient never understands anything about his
								Oedipal complex, they don't care at all."

								The day at Fort Logan begins with a cottage report on the previous day, written
								and read by one of the patients ("Albert slept for two hours before midnight. There
								was a complaint about popcorn on the floor"). Afterward there is a brief meeting
								of the staff team and then group therapy, with nine patients and three team members.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the group-therapy period, after a long awkward silence, a heavy blond woman begins
								to talk. Haltingly, but with growing eagerness, she tells about her disastrous honeymoon,
								her hysterectomy, an attempt at suicide, and the inattention of her husband. The
								great, unbroken flood of grievances and failures ends, there is another pause, and
								then several people question whether the fault is all on the husband's side.
							</p>
							<p>
								A nervous, sharp-featured woman named Ethel says that the blond woman should try
								being more responsive, and several people berate Ethel for being too critical of
								everybody. Then an energetic Negro woman tells a silent, timid little woman beside
								her that she is entirely too passive and ought to be more positive about things.
								The little woman thinks a moment, then says uncertainly, "What would you suggest,
								Martha?" and the group breaks up, laughing.
							</p>
							<p>
								Afterward there is another staff-team meeting. The talk is inconclusive and interspersed
								with long stretches when no one says anything:
							</p>
							<p>
								"I wonder if we're going through a phase where we have to get back on the feel level."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Ethel got openly angry at the group, and the group got angry at her."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Yesterday was terrible. The whole damn hospital was bad."
							</p>
							<p>
								Next, five members of the staff team go to practice psychodrama. In psychodrama
								each team member or patient plays himself or another member of the team or another
								patient, trying to express the way they think that person feels. The director is
								a beautiful, cool, red-haired former actress, and she starts with a short lecture:
								"If you know the group is destructive, I would not hold the psychodrama. I am not
								going to let anybody get up there and expose themselves and be torn to bits." Then
								a single chair is placed on the small stage, and after a little hesitation, a social
								worker goes up on the stage beside the chair.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am putting the staff in the chair, at a team meeting," she explains. To the staff
								in the chair, she says, "I am sorry that I have let Ethel drive me away." She describes
								at length her impatience with Ethel, who is often cantankerous. "I can't work with
								her any more until I can work out my feelings," the social worker concludes unhappily.
							</p>
							<p>
								A Negro technician gets up and says he will talk to Ethel on the phone. "Ethel,
								I don't know how much you can ask of the staff," he says. "They give, give, give,
								and I think it's about time you did something."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Respond as Ethel," the director says, and when he does, she says, "You don't sound
								as though you mean it."
							</p>
							<p>
								After lunch in the cafeteria, most of the group watch a movie about alcoholism,
								and the discussion that follows goes far afield, A large, slow boy on day care says
								he has been drugged many times and resents it, then turns to a pretty young nurse
								and says, "Why don't you talk about your problems?" She covers her face in embarrassment.
								"I'm a nurse," she squeals.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Psychiatrists are nuts," somebody says.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is another staff-team meeting that afternoon, about an ex-patient who has
								been doing well in family care, about another who is being re-admitted, and about
								a 15-year-old boy, ready to go home, whose parents have manufactured a story about
								his being away which could put a strain on him.
							</p>
							<p>
								That evening, while the patients watch TV or play games, two nurses from the team
								go to a group session of 16 outpatients, during which a lonely old woman starts
								to cry while telling about a nice girl next door who once brought her a slice of
								cake. Afterward the nurses distribute handfuls of drugs, about half a dozen bottles
								per patient. "The system at Fort Logan is so unstructured, it took me two years
								to get comfortable," one nurse says later. "Now I love it. It isn't dull. You're
								on your own. You can take initiative. ..."
							</p>
							<p>
								It is hard to catch people in the act of getting better at Fort Logan, but they
								do. "I had been in private treatment," says the heavy blond woman, and when I
								first came here I couldn't believe I could discuss my problems with a group, and
								that people would be interested." "I get up every morning," the boy on day care
								says "and all I can think about is getting to Fort Logan."
							</p>
							<p>
								"There are three elements in treatment here," Dr. Kraft has said. "One, the removal
								of the patient from the immediate area of pressure. He can rest, think and recuperate.
								That's very important, not to be underestimated. Two, the drugs. Three, the living-learning
								situation, the school for living.
							</p>
							<p>
								"We're becoming adept at treating certain kinds of patients, but there are dozens
								we don't know a damn thing about. But there's willingness to question, in psychiatry,
								that hasn't been around before. Gerald Caplan of Harvard can conceive of a psychiatrist
								who never sees a patient but works entirely through the police, educators, and so
								on. The mentally ill are one among many disadvantaged groups, the elderly, racial
								minorities, and the political atmosphere of our country is stimulating scientific
								advances in these things. There's a new pizazz."
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the most dramatic products of psychiatry's new pizazz has been the number
								of programs which drastically shorten hospital time or treat patients briefly without
								any hospitalisation at all. (As radical as Fort Logan's program is, its patients
								spend an average of 145 days in treatment, 35 of these as residents, the remainder
								in day and outpatient care.) Because of the shortage of psychiatrists, brief psychotherapy
								is often justified as the only alternative to no therapy, but several recent surveys
								have strongly suggested that it is at least as effective as long stays in hospitals,
								and is much preferred by patients and their relatives. Many psychotherapists are
								convinced that changes also continue long after the treatment stops, and that brief
								therapy can promote basic changes in character.
							</p>
							<p>
								In California, San Mateo County's hospitalisation rate is 148 people out of 100,000.
								This compares with a national rate of 238 and a rate of 264 in neighbouring San
								Francisco County. The San Mateo Community Mental Health Centre program consists
								on the average of six days in the hospital followed by several months of day and
								outpatient care. "We're simply finding that it's not advisable to keep psychotic
								people in the hospital more than seven days, because if they stay longer, they begin
								to adopt the hospital atmosphere," says Dr. Joseph Downing, the director. "The
								chief of our inpatient services came here five years ago, feeling strongly that
								we were sending people out too soon. Now he's completely changed his mind and we're
								sending them out even faster than we were when he came."
							</p>
							<p>
								An important factor in San Mateo's low hospitalisation rate is the mental health
								centre's home evaluations of patients for whom commitment has been asked. As a result
								of these evaluations, half the patients involved have been able to stay outside
								the hospital altogether. "I make one visit, it can run a couple of hours trying
								to figure out what has upset the apple cart," says Dr. Gerald Lutovich, a private
								psychiatrist who makes many of the evaluations. "If I can't make a decision, I come
								back two, three, even five times. These are mainly the hard core, who deny completely
								that they're sick, and many of them won't get much better or much worse. I tell
								them, 'I'm really here to get your side of the story.' Diagnosis is not the most
								important thing; the question is whether they can function without being a danger
								to society or themselves.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The danger is that in our enthusiasm to treat outside the hospital, we may be keeping
								out people who could be treated better inside. Sometimes we put too much of a strain
								on a family that's already pretty weak. Sometimes a decisive, dramatic gesture does
								more for the family. But very few of these people are a danger to themselves or
								others. The axiom used to be, 'If in doubt, hospitalise.' We're kind of working
								on the theory, 'If in doubt, don't hospitalise.'"
							</p>
							<p>
								An even more dramatic anti-hospitalisation program has been set up in Portland,
								Maine, by Dr. Richard A. Levy, a tall, dark, briskly informal young psychiatrist,
								born in New York and trained at Mt. Sinai. Dr. Levy has a private office in Portland,
								where he keeps a portable heater at the foot of the couch for the convenience of
								patients who want to take off their shoes. The Portland clinic, where he is now
								an adviser, is equally down to earth. The clinic is the only public psychiatric
								facility in the city; as such, it treats only the most severely ill and tries to
								keep them functioning outside the state hospital in Augusta. The entire treatment
								program consists of six visits over three or four months, and it relies on rapid
								diagnosis, reassurance, drugs, and the help of visiting nurses, homemakers, employers
								and especially members of the patient's family. The clinic treated 500 people during
								its first 14 months, and only seven of them went on to the state hospital.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I used to worry a lot during the first fourteen months," Dr. Levy once said. "Would
								we have a suicide or a homicide? I send a lot of rocky people home. But acute illnesses
								are usually related to specific events. At the beginning you explore the immediate
								crisis and give the person reassurance; he's not the only one who ever felt that
								way, and there's a big difference between having bizarre thoughts and acting on
								them. When you've sat with depressed patient after depressed patient, you get a
								feeling for the intensity of the depression. If I do my job fairly well, and don't
								accuse them of being murderers in the first five minutes, they'll generally relax.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Our patients are suffering from severe anxiety, or panic, or depression to the
								point of suicide, or complete psychosis, with complete loss of control. The odds
								are favourable that you will find out the true cause of the trouble in six visits.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Probably most psychiatrists would find it difficult to believe that so much could
								be accomplished in so short a time. I myself felt that way at one time. And I've
								been astonished at the low number of returnees. In five years only 27 have made
								a return visit, and we've never had to give a complete second series of treatments
								to anybody."
							</p>
							<p>
								The clinic's program is precise and efficient. While Dr. Levy is getting the patient's
								history and prescribing medication, a social worker interviews the family and enlists
								its aid. In subsequent visits Dr. Levy explores the crisis further, helps the patient
								to recognize the characteristic and inappropriate way in which he reacts to problems,
								and, at the last visit, assures him that he may come in again if he feels the need.
