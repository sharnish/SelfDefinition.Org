							<p>
								Now, dear reader, if you have comprehended the foregoing, in which I have tried
								to demonstrate to you that man is simply a machine, forced into action by his environment
								&ndash; this I have learned through hypnosis, which I consider merely a side issue to
								the Law of Suggestion, a crude and tyrannical use of suggestion &ndash; we will go a
								step further and try to understand the body of man, which is his closest environment.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Law of nature
							</p>
							<p>
								To do so it will first be necessary to explain what you call the "law of nature"
								or "hand of God." After I have made you comprehend that, I shall then be able to
								discuss mankind in general.
							</p>
							<p>
								If we drop a plum seed, peach seed, apple seed and a grape seed in six square inches
								of earth what will grow from them? Each of its kind. Why? One says the "law of nature,"
								another says the "hand of God." I ask what is meant by these terms, as neither has
								affected me through my senses, and a sickly smile comes on your lips, and you say,
								"Don't you know?" I plead ignorance and reply, "No," then you won't talk with me
								because I fail to know something that you do not know.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Law of Suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								Then you ask <em>me</em> why, and I tell you the "Law of Suggestion." You say, "Why,
								there must be an intelligence to respond to that law." As it is impossible to conceive
								of anything happening without an intelligence (associated action) to guide it, every
								action of all matter is guided.
							</p>
							<!-- p 105 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								All matter contains mind
							</p>
							<p>
								Note. &ndash; I will state that all matter contains mind (which word will be used from
								now on without the quotation marks), and all mind gives expression in matter. Matter
								is the expression of mind &ndash; transformed mind &ndash; the utterance of mind; it is
								the material reproduction of mind; there can be no matter without mind, no mind
								without matter. <em>Other than matter is incomprehensible.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								This intelligence is acted upon by suggestion. There is mind in the rock, otherwise
								the rock would not disintegrate (respond to the suggestion of the elements). There
								is mind within wood. You say, "No, water rots wood." Water does not rot wood. It
								forces (suggests) a latent (memory) action in wood to produce or transform into
								rot. As long as the suggestion is kept from the wood, that action will not take
								place; the moment the suggestion is applied, the intelligence within the wood responds.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								All changes are advancement
							</p>
							<p>
								All changes are an advancement and good (natural response).
							</p>
							<p>
								All suggestions are transformed. You of the "law of nature" and the "hand of God"
								claim that intelligence is external and everywhere; I claim it to be internal and
								everywhere, that all matter contains within itself intelligence (mind).
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Maturity
							</p>
							<p>
								Then you ask me what is mind and in turn I ask you this question: What is maturity?
								When does a boy become a man, a girl become a woman, and when is fruit ripe? When
								the seed is accomplished. As the seed is the last thing accomplished to complete
								the entirety of all attributes required, all of the preceding actions, i. e., responses
								to suggestion of the development of the tree that has taken place are registered
								within the seed.
							</p>
							<!-- p 106 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Mind defined
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, the complete memory must be in the last thing accomplished &ndash; the seed;
								and I will define mind to be <em>the consensus of all actions acquired during gestation,</em>
								not a so-called reasoning intelligence, but a memory of response to suggestion,
								as to heat, cold, different elements of the earth, to guide the commingling into
								the reproduction of its kind. If the natural suggestions do not occur, a <em>reproduction</em>
								is an impossibility.
							</p>
							<p>
								To illustrate, if plenty of sunshine is required and the suggestion of sunshine
								is lacking, the entire fulfillment of the suggestion required cannot or will not
								be accomplished. If iron or some certain element in the soil is necessary to force
								a certain action, and is lacking, the response necessary will not take place. In
								the spring time, when warmth, et cetera, surrounds the trees, the buds are forced
								out.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Suggestion in lower life
							</p>
							<p>
								If frosts occur, contraction takes place and the buds are pinched off, the entire
								action of the tree being in accordance with the environment (suggestion). To the
								degree of the suggestion is the degree of response, identical with the action of
								man.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Jacob knew of the law
							</p>
							<p>
								Genesis, Chapter XXX, 37-40, reads as follows:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									37. And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree;
									and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
								</p>
								<p>
									38. And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in
									the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when
									they came to drink.
								</p>
								<!--
                                  p.  107
                                -->
								<p>
									39. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked,
									speckled and spotted.
								</p>
								<p>
									[40 is not included in text]</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								This simple law, the law of environment (suggestion), was in some degree known to
								Jacob. Therefore, what is, was, and always will be. There is nothing new in the
								world, only new to our comprehension.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Darwin
							</p>
							<p>
								Darwin showed us that animals most like their environment, or those which responded
								closest to (were part of) their environment survived, while the others were destroyed.
								Man, being a creature of his environment, survives to the degree he responds to
								or is part of that environment.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								As of their environment
							</p>
							<p>
								In the Arctic region animals are white as of their environment; in the reeds they
								are striped, therefore look like the reeds and are not easily distinguishable from
								them; up in the tree tops they are spotted. The negro from exposure to the sun was
								made black. If the white man goes into the sun he becomes what we call "tanned";
								that tan can, in time, become very dark. The negro, therefore, is black only as
								a result of his environment.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Energy
							</p>
							<p>
								Man, not being a perpetual motion machine, must obtain energy elsewhere than through
								or from his food as our scientists&nbsp;(?) tell us. The energy required to digest the
								food must be greater than all the energy in the food, otherwise it could not overcome
								the resistance; therefore, it is self-evident that our energy does not come from
								the food.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Energetic wares
							</p>
							<p>
								Any condition that overcomes resistance sends out an energetic wave; every time
								we breathe, blink our eye, talk or move, we send out an energetic wave, which can
								be transmitted only through matter.
							</p>

							<p class="sidenote">
								Life
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Life is energy,</em> always moving and being reinforced as it passes through
								new matter; and I believe those energetic waves are received in the spleen, passed
								to the solar plexus and from the solar plexus passed to the extremities through
								the Sympathetic System. It is through the absorption of this energy &ndash; which is
								life &ndash; that keeps man going.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Death
							</p>
							<p>
								When a man dies the machinery of his body &ndash; the Sympathetic System &ndash; fails to
								respond, to receive, to exert, or transform the energy.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Ovum of the female
							</p>
							<p>
								The first part of a child formed is the Sympathetic System. A girl has reached maturity
								when she can reproduce; i. e., when she monthly gives forth an egg. In that egg
								is a memory action of building the Sympathetic System, when fertilized by an element
								of the male.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Element of the male
							</p>
							<p>
								Bear in mind that the element of the male is only a fertilizer.

								The Sympathetic System centers are developed at the end of eight weeks. (See Gray.)

							<p class="sidenote">
								Building of mind in man
							</p>
							<p>
								Now each ganglion acquires a specific memory from the same ganglion of the mother,
								and out of the blood of the mother builds over itself the form of the child. Therefore,
								when the child is born it contains within itself the intelligence that built it;
								i. e., mind. Every six months this intelligence rebuilds the entire tissues of the
								body.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								No cerebral knowledge
							</p>
							<p>
								The child when born has no cerebral knowledge. It must learn to see, hear, smell,
								feel and taste. It has no reflexes other than of contraction. All other actions
								are acquired after birth. The heart action was learned from the mother; also the
								respiration, which action can very easily be changed. It must learn to take the
								breast. It has no control over its bowels or bladder. The pupil of the eye does
								not dilate, contract, nor blink at light. The child's limbs will not draw away from
								heat or irritation. If the rectal sphincter be severely dilated a response in the
								throat will occur. This same action can always be repeated with a chloroformed patient,
								showing that the noise is simply a response at the other end of the nerve.

								All things are learned
							</p>
							<p>
								From the taking of the breast the child must learn to digest food, to respond to
								its environment. The moment a child readily does so, it is said to have displayed
								intelligence.
							</p>
							<p>
								Physicians differ as to the length of the period after children are born into the
								world before they can see, hear, smell, feel and taste. There is much discussion,
								and many volumes have been written as to the length of time after a child is born
								before its senses are established. After much reading, I finally ask what is meant
								by seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling and tasting; and none of the writers have
								comprehensively answered. Therefore, why this discussion? What are they talking
								about?
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Definition of the senses
							</p>
							<p>
								I will define the senses to be the correlation of the different nerve-end stimuli.
								Give a new-born child soft, sweet, soothing sound-stimulus, then harsh, discordant
								sound-stimulus, and the moment a memory of these two extreme nerve-end contacts
								with sound waves is established, the child will be able to give expression to the
								degrees of all subsequent stimuli of the auditory nerve-ends. The same with smelling,
								tasting, et cetera. Sight, unless associated with feeling, conveys no form expression.
								A child, to be taught the meaning of round, must not only see it but feel it. The
								same with other forms. The child is now learning to respond to its environment.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Mind a tenant
							</p>
							<p>
								Mind is the tenant of the house it lives in &ndash; the body. That house is always wasting;
								mind rebuilding it. When mind rebuilds correctly, we have a healthy body; when incorrectly,
								we have what is called sickness. Mind can only build as of itself, as it responds
								to its environment, and consequently must be a reproduction of that environment,
								modified by the acquired memory learned from the mother. Therefore, the house in
								which it dwells is the exact representation of its tenant &ndash; matter being the expression
								of mind.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Food
							</p>
							<p>
								Food If a man takes possession of a new brick house and starts in to replace with
								bad bricks as it wastes away, at the end of six or seven months he will live in
								a bad brick house. If he replaces with rotten lumber he will live in a rotten lumber
								house at the end of a period. Hence, man partakes of the nature of the food he eats.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, if mind be worried so that he builds awry, his house will be awry; and if his
								house be awry and he finds his error and corrects it, he will reestablish the symmetry
								of his dwelling. (Rational treatment &ndash; the orificial surgeon and personal suggestion.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Thus mind rules and builds the body, but a time may come when the body becomes so
								awry that it rules the tenant. In health, mind rules; after severe illness the body
								may.
							</p>

							<p class="sidenote">
								Error
							</p>
							<p>
								Mind cannot choose to correct its error, it can only respond; the suggestion must
								change. Error can only be distinguished, when known, in comparison with good. Unhealthy
								surroundings must be changed. The closest environment &ndash; the body, may require
								the knife.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Mind rules
							</p>
							<p>
								It is inconceivable for anything to happen without an intelligence to guide it.
								I have shown the intelligence that built the body &ndash; that keeps rebuilding the
								body &ndash; but our learned&nbsp;(?) physicians seem to think that the body of man is a
								dunghill in which seed may be sown and foul vegetation grow, forgetting that nothing
								in the body can happen without an intelligence to guide it &ndash; that the body is
								a result, and there is no cause within the tissue itself.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Nerve-ends
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Every nerve has two ends.</em> When there is an irritation at one end, there
								is a response, or so-called reflex, at the other. Oh ! why has this thought never
								occurred to our "learned authorities?" Our worthy doctors are forever trying to
								remove the effect, never reaching the cause. If a man's blood is out of order, does
								the bad blood cause illness, or is the illness and bad blood the result of the imperfect
								transforming of food by the intelligence whose duty it is to perform such functions?
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Three pulsations
							</p>
							<p>
								When I first showed my ability to produce in a hypnotized subject three pulsations
								at one time, the doctors declared it to be a trick; that it was an impossibility;
								that the heart only controlled the circulation. If our most learned&nbsp;(?) men would
								only think (and such a thing were possible), they
								<!-- p 111 -->
								would readily see the futility of such claims. If I am rightly informed, there are
								several miles of vascular piping in the body, and the heart of itself is not strong
								enough to pump the blood that distance; if it were, the frame of the body is not
								strong enough to maintain the resistance to such an action. The truth of the matter
								is, that the heart is simply the governor, i.e., the regulator, that starts the
								rhythm of the pumping, and different nerve centers (mind) take up and carry on the
								action. Our doctors tell us that a man dies because the heart stops beating. No,
								he dies because the intelligence that forces the heart to beat stops working.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Man a tube
							</p>
							<p>
								Man is a tube lined with a series of insulated electric wires. These wires run from
								orifice through ganglia of Abdominal Brain to orifice. Every nerve has two ends;
								irritate one end and through the action of its ganglia a response will occur at
								the other. Our doctors treat the response, paying no attention to the cause, although
								they talk nothing but cause.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Body re-built every six months
							</p>
							<p>
								From a series of experiments that I have made, I am satisfied that the body is rebuilt
								every six or seven months. The Abdominal Brain in the embryonic child is complete
								at the end of two months; and, as the child is born at the end of nine months, the
								first attempt of the Sympathetic System, the Abdominal Brain (mind) built a complete
								child in seven months; although a child born at eight months is seemingly complete.
								If mind in its first attempt can build a child in seven months, why should it take
								longer to build a second time, particularly when it has a freer hand and environment
								to work in?
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								"Bugs"
							</p>
							<p>
								Our doctors start on the premise that man's eyes, lungs, heart and all vital organs
								live forever, unless bugs get in and destroy them. I cannot accept any such statement.
								For the sake of argument we will say that all organs and tissue are rebuilt every
								six months. I care not if every six years, but we will assume that they are rebuilt
								every six months, constantly wasting and constantly being replaced. The doctors
								will tell us that a cataract grows on our eye. I deny that, maintaining that the
								eyes are replaced every six months, and when there is a cataract, the ganglion of
								the Abdominal Brain (mind) is so irritated that it builds an imperfect eye, an eye
								with a cataract. The doctor with his knife removes the cataract, and ninety-nine
								times out of a hundred <em>it grows&nbsp;(?) back.</em>
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Rebuilding
							</p>
							<p>
								The Mental Scientists, the Christian Scientists, the Faith Curists and the Hypnotists
								remove the cataract. How? By causing the mind to stop building the cataract and

								and myopia, and several cases of cataract simply through personal suggestion and
								orificial surgery.

								<p>
									&quot;What is that, &ndash; the nerve habit?&quot;
								</p>
							</div>

								&quot;Why, I mean this, that until you were eighteen, your ganglia (mind) built good
								eyes, when, through an irritation, it developed into building a pair of bad eyes,
								called astigmatism, myopia, et cetera. You get two pairs of eyes a year, in eighteen years you get thirty-six pairs of eyes; and up to that time the ganglia (mind)
								has the memory of building good eyes, in twelve years it builds twenty-four pairs
								of eyes; after the cause of building bad eyes is removed, I must force the memory
								of thirty-six to overcome the memory of twenty-four, which is not a very difficult
								task; but if you came to me ten years later, it would be nearly impossible for me
								to cause a memory of thirty-six
								<!-- p. 114 -->
								to overcome a memory of forty-four. Where the nerve habit or new memory is not too
								pronounced, through personal suggestion I can readily revive the first memory. It
								is through the lack of knowing how to overcome this that our orificialists fail
								in many cases.

								Greatest use for hypnotic suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;This is the greatest use of so-called hypnotic suggestion &ndash; the breaking up of
								nerve habits.&quot;

								The same argument holds good as to the lungs, and in all early stages of heart trouble,
								et cetera.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Consumption
							</p>
							<p>
								The doctors tell us that when we have consumption, bugs are nesting in and eating
								our lungs; but why, most wise&nbsp;(?) gentlemen? Life is indestructible, and if you
								will use microscopes powerful enough you will always find life (bugs). When man
								is most dead&nbsp;(?) and burned to a handful of ashes, drop a little acetic acid on
								them and you will find there is life, movement; and life is simply energy.
							</p>
							<p>
								I maintain that man gets a new pair of lungs every six months, and when the ganglion
								that controls the building of the lungs transforms the food into healthy lungs,
								we lack consumption; that when it makes an imperfect transformation we have the
								so-called diseased lung, the germ, which is the mal-transformation of food containing

							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Jews
							</p>
							<p>
								Why is it there are so few Jews in the penitentiaries, insane asylums, who are cancerous
								or consumptive among the males? Why are the Jews a money-making race? Oh, they inherit
								it. No. A Jew is but a human being, he is the same as you and I; he is ruled by
								the same Law of Suggestion. It is first, because he is circumcised, secondly, because
								he is clean, and third, his Abdominal Brain (mind) is not worried or irritated.
								Consequently, he is full of life and energy, and his brain works in a "normal" manner.
							</p>
							<p>
								He eats clean food, producing the same result and, therefore, is equipped to do
								business with a "normal" mind, he is free from the "abnormal," therefore, not a
								criminal, not a
								<!-- p. 117 -->
								candidate for the insane asylum; his thoughts are healthful and therefore he looks
								forward to a long life, to a large family, to the care of them, and to the necessity
								of acquiring the means whereby they can live; he is nearly "normal." The law of
								Moses, although unexplained by his followers, was a law of health; a healthy mind
								is always the result of a healthy body, or a healthy body is the result of the healthy
								mind, impossible to find one each way.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Bad blood
							</p>
							<p>
								When food is impure, the ganglia whose duty it is to transform and make pure blood,
								is working awry, and nothing done to the blood will purify it as to the health of
								man. Inasmuch as the ganglia will continue to make bad blood, why treat the blood?
							</p>
							<p>
								A man's bowels are constipated and the doctor gives him a drug. Does the drug empty
								the bowel? No, the drug does not. Why is the bowel not working properly? Because
								the ganglia that control secretion and peristalsis are not doing their duty, and
								nothing but those ganglia can empty the bowel.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Drugs are suggestions
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, the drug is simply a suggestion that stimulates these ganglia and causes
								them to renew their action of secretion and peristalsis. Catarrh, asthma, heart
								trouble, rheumatism and functional diseases are all a result of irritation at the
								other end of the nerve. The idea of trying to drug or treat the heart for its imperfect
								action is ridiculous.
							</p>
							<p>
								My intelligent reader now asks where the other end of these nerves are? How is it
								the doctor has not discovered them? I will tell you why, my good reader.
							</p>
							<!-- p.  118 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Too scientific
							</p>
							<p>
								Our doctors have failed to discover the end of the nerve, inasmuch as they are "scientific"
								and do not know how to "think." They reason deductively, which is not reasoning.
								From a true premise no deduction should be necessary, inasmuch as the cause and
								effect are perceptible.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Reasoning
							</p>
							<p>
								Reasoning, so-called, is required when only an effect is perceptible, and one has
								to go back to the cause. The moment the cause is found no more reasoning is required.
								The cause and effect are so closely associated that when we comprehend the cause,
								we must comprehend the effect. Inductive reasoning is the only true reasoning, and
								our scientists&nbsp;(?) know nothing of this, they much prefer to assume a cause and
								force a deduction to fit the effect known. How many inductive reasoners has the
								world produced? Not fifty, and I include all great thinkers in the fifty.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Clean&nbsp;(?) people
							</p>
							<p>
								Our doctor is a good, clean&nbsp;(?) man; his patients are good, clean&nbsp;(?) people, and
								they greatly dislike to think of anything that is "naughty," forgetting that all
								"naughty" things are a perversion of good things; and that the being who appears
								the most "nice," at heart is the worst.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Modesty
							</p>
							<p>
								Little children are taught that it is awful to hear anything mentioned about their
								privates. In many states physiology is barred from the public schools, as it is
								something awful for man to understand himself. As everything suggests positive for
								or positive against, the real modest person is simply the positive opposite to the
								real vulgar person, both having the same thought,
								<!-- p 118 -->
								only one gives action in blushing, et cetera &ndash; alleged modesty &ndash; while the other
								gives action in vulgar expressions. The truly pure being would be neutral &ndash; no
								ideas associated as to bad.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dear reader, one can have no thought without its expression (for that is all a thought
								is), and alleged modesty deceives no one, least of all one versed in human nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								In all my years of experience (and I can read a face like a book &ndash; I know
								my nerve-ends), I have met but three really healthy women, and they were Southerners;
								and no healthy men.
							</p>
							<p>
								Someone speaks in public of a woman's leg, many cast their eyes down and others
								blush; some laugh. The sexual look appears in the eyes of others. Let us analyze
								the thoughts of these four classes of people. When "leg" is mentioned, the first
								party would not cast his eyes down unless he had "bad" ideas associated; the second
								would not have blushed if he had good ideas associated; the third would not have
								laughed, nor the sexual look have appeared in the eyes of the fourth, had they not
								all proportionately associated the same ideas.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Not
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, the ideas are mostly acquired, &ndash; particularly in the first three &ndash; by the
								parents telling them not to think of this, not to do that, and the entirely false
								thought of modesty, or something "bad" was associated and placed in their minds
								through their "bad" mother telling them they must not do or think of these things.
								Remember, all things in the world are good, and man has created the bad. Life keeps
								moving onward, which is good, and no matter which way it moves it is always onward
								and always good, and the "bad" is produced by the "not's," the "don't's," and the
								"mustn't's."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								"Bad" defined

								The nerve-ends of all the upper orifices and the heart and lungs, terminate in the

								I have cured stutterers, all classes of eye trouble, all kinds of nervousness in

								In 1895, while claiming in my lectures that we must have an Abdominal Brain &ndash;
								otherwise there was no logical explanation as to many of the conditions I was producing
								through hypnosis, in Lansing, Michigan &ndash; Doctor William D. Cooper drew my attention
								to the wonderful results Dr. E. H. Pratt, of Chicago (the father of orificial surgery),
								was attaining by operating on the lower orifices, and intimated that perhaps he
								was reaching the Abdominal Brain. This intimation prompted me to visit Dr. Pratt
								and learn of his work, which in time resulted in my believing that the Sympathetic
								System was my much sought Abdominal Brain, and much study and experiment has resulted
								in the foregoing synopsis.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Environment
							</p>
							<!-- P 121 --->
							<p>
								If man is ruled by his environment, it naturally follows that his body must be his
								closest environment; as the body is, so is the "mind;" as is the "mind," so the
								body.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Sin&nbsp;(?) a disease
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, blackguarding, sensuality and prostitution are physical diseases. If
								man's thoughts are forced on him through his five senses, it follows that, if he
								has a sexual irritation, sexual thoughts will always dominate. Therefore, instead
								of passing laws against those "sins," hospitals should be established and convicted
								invalids sent there to be properly treated.
							</p>
							<p>
								Prostitution is a curable disease. The orificial surgeon can remove the physical
								suggestion, and the hypnotist can break up the nerve habit.
							</p>
							<p>
								If we put a clean woman in a dirty house, and keep the house dirty for a certain
								length of time, that woman will become disgusted and have no desire to clean up.
								Put a dirty woman in a clean house, keep the house clean for a period, and that
								woman will become ashamed and acquire habits of neatness. So it is with the mind
								and the body. When the body becomes foul, the mind degenerates and vice versa. The
								food is the material out of which the body is made, and foul food builds a foul
								body and "mind," notwithstanding the false theories of our alleged scientists.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Food
							</p>
							<p>
								Man's stomach is the hopper of a mill, made to grind and digest certain foods. If
								man partakes of food to re-establish his body, his present eating must be radically
								wrong, because at least three-fourths of the food taken into the stomach is passed
								off through the bowels; if he ate proper food, ninety-five per cent of it should
								be turned into tissue and the waste should be correspondingly small. What fool man
								does to-day is to put
								<!-- P 122 --->
								all kinds of indigestible food&nbsp;(?) into his hopper, and when the mill tries to grind,
								it breaks down; he then sends for his doctor and expects him &ndash; if he could &ndash;
								to repair the mill so that he can go on trying to grind flint with machinery intended
								to grind wheat only.
							</p>
							<p>
								Remember this, a child's stomach is gradually taught to digest coarse food. In other
								words, it must learn to transform the different foreign elements passed into the
								stomach.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Flesh eating
							</p>
							<p>
								No argument offered can substantiate the necessity of flesh-eating. The strongest
								animals in the world, proportionately, are the ox, the ass and the elephant, strict
								vegetarians; and each and every pound of their flesh represents an equal proportion
								of vegetable strength, a concentration of many times its bulk of vegetable matter,
								and vegetable life was before animal life. The vicious animals in the world are
								the lion, the tiger, and all flesh-eating animals. In certain parts of the Orient
								are horses that eat flesh, and are so vicious that only the most expert can handle
								them. If you desire to make your dog vicious, chain him up and feed him on flesh.
							</p>
							<p>
								The life of modern man is one of confinement, and in every pound of flesh he eats
								he takes into his system a hundred times more energy than it is possible for him
								to give voice to. Being possessed of this concentrated energy, he can get rid of
								it only by giving it a counter-irritant or energy absorber in the form of liquor,
								sensuality and brutality.
							</p>

								During the Greco-Turkish war, the non-meat-eaters and abstainers from alcohol paid
								but little attention to wounds similar to those that sent the meat-eaters to the

								others.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								The hog
							</p>
							<p>
								The hog is a scavenger, living on filth and transforming filth into its body, which
								is simply a concentrated form of filth. Lazy man takes this filth into his stomach,
								transforms it into his flesh, and wonders why he is syphilitic, cancerous, diseased,
								lazy and sluggish. I have given health to many families by causing them to cut pork
								and lard from off their bills of fare.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								All fat is filth

								The lady with the blotched face goes to her physician, and he advises her to avoid
								eating pastry. For Heaven's sake ! What can be healthier than flour and fruits?
								What, then, must be the only thing that is detrimental? Why, the lard, the shortening
								in the pastry.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Lazy
							</p>
							<p>
								My experience and investigations have shown me that the majority of the poor people,
								who can barely get money enough together to buy a little "sow-belly" and meal, are
								always the lazy, indolent, worthless class of people, whose entire tissue is made
								up of hog meat, and consequently have very sluggish brains. I have yet to meet a
								confirmed pork-eater with an active mentality.
							</p>
							<p>
								For three years I abstained from eating flesh, two years of which was the most delightful
								existence I ever experienced. Having a clean tenant in a clean house, my thoughts
								were pure, my actions
								<!-- p 123 -->
								pure; but found I lacked the energy to keep up the race with the over-wrought, pell
								mell, flesh-eating environment. I firmly believe that there is no case of syphilis
								so severe but proper dieting will re-establish a healthy condition.

								Fasting
							</p>
							<p>
								Since my experiments of putting subjects to sleep for seven days, many dyspeptics
								have taken up the fast cure and have demonstrated beyond all question that much
								good is consummated by total abstinence from food. Our doctors are daily killing
								their patients by feeding them. When mind requires food, food will be demanded.
								<em>There is never danger of a patient starving to death.</em>
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Small-pox
							</p>
							<p>
								Mind responds to the suggestion of matter. Our doctors tell us that we are vast
								sewers, filled with bugs that are devouring one another; that the more chemicals,
								the more putrid matter they can put into us the better we are. First, they warn
								us to beware of the pus of a sore, yet take the pus of cow-syphilis &ndash; cow-pox
								&ndash; and put it into the pure body of a helpless babe to prevent its getting a harmless
								disease, a disease that any first-class homeopath laughs at, small-pox &ndash; a disease
								that is non-contagious, non-infectious, as is proven by vaccination, which fails
								to produce small-pox &ndash; Oh ! the scientists&nbsp;(?). This was demonstrated beyond all
								question last summer by a physician in Wisconsin eating the virus and spreading
								it all over his face; he fed it to at least thirty of his patients and none contracted
								the disease. <em>Small-pox decreases with the advancement of sanitation.</em>
							</p>
							<!-- p 124 -->
							<p>
								Strange to say, our doctors marvel at the increase of syphilitic affections, of
								tubercular conditions of the body and of the bones, of the prevalence of hip disease,
								yet fail to see that it comes from the inoculation of these innocent children with
								cow-syphilis. I would unhesitatingly kill any member of a board of health or any
								officer who would enforce the inoculation of any of my family with this syphilis,
								and the jury does not live that would convict me. The body being rebuilt every six
								months, the so-called immunizing could only be effective for that period.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Pointer for the doctors

							<p>
								Now, my scientific&nbsp;(?) friends, as I have taught you something that is irrefutable,
								have the boards of health force a law that all shall be poxed every six months.
								What a lot of idle doctors would be kept busy.
							</p>
							<p>
								These philosophers&nbsp;(?), these scientists&nbsp;(?), fill horses with disease and take
								the serum, fill it full of drugs to keep it from spoiling&nbsp;(?), "shoot" it into the
								arms of helpless babes to cure them of diphtheria, and when they die of lockjaw
								and other diseases produced by the poison so injected into their blood, the doctors
								suddenly discover that they got hold of the wrong toxin, otherwise the children
								would have recovered. Never! A lie given to protect a fool theory.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, as the body is rebuilt every six months, and there is an intelligence building
								the body, an intelligence that is making the blood, an intelligence than is transforming
								this blood so made into tissue, what in the mischief have bugs to do with disease?
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Germs
							</p>
							<p>
								The germ is life; impossible to find life without germs or germs without life, and
								the germ is simply a transformation of form of life; if the intelligence within
								the body is surrounded with suggestions of health, forcing it to perform its functions
								in a natural and proper way, it will make the correct transformation which is known
								as health; but if the rhythm of its work is interfered with, it will make mal-transformations
								which are recognized as germs of this, that, and the other disease.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Remove the cause
							</p>
							<!-- p 126 -->
							<p>
								The removing of the germ is of no consequence, inasmuch as the intelligence (mind)
								still builds more germs. Remove the cause, allow the intelligence that built to
								rebuild correctly, and the "specific" germs will disappear. Killing the germs is
								like to a man who is annoyed by a hen laying an egg on his porch every morning,
								and he sends the servant out to destroy the egg. If you want to stop the laying
								of the egg on the porch, remove the hen.
							</p>
							<p>
								Good blood and bad blood are results of the building of the intelligence (mind)
								that makes the blood, and any bugs or anything of that kind you find in your blood
								are simply the badly or goodly made blood.

								Body a result
							</p>
							<p>
								Our doctors seem to think that man is built and rebuilt without an intelligence

								the body is a result, and that the entire result is guided by the all-wise intelligence
								of mind, this mind being subservient to and part of the Law of Suggestion &ndash; its

								I have the blister. What made the first blister? What made the second? Well, the
								first blister was made by the cantharides plaster. No, sir; it was not. The first
								blister was suggested by the plaster, which caused the ganglion that built the tissue
								of that area of the arm to accomplish a condition called a "blister," that action,
								being associated with the cerebral memory of the name "cantharides plaster," was
								aroused in the hypnosis through the word "plaster" and the ganglion built the second blister as it did the first.

								Can I reproduce this blister on the right arm? No. Why not? Because the ganglion

								she reaches the mind. The mind stopped building the wart and began building healthy
								tissue. The doctor cuts it off, but seldom reaches the mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								No result can be produced in the body until the mind is reached. Drugs are nothing
								but suggestions. We will assume that a man's bowels are constipated and the doctor
								gives him a dose of calomel. Does the calomel move the bowels? Yes. Good. If I put
								into a glass jar some food with some calomel, will it "move"? What is constipation?
								Why, it is lack of secretions, lack of peristalsis. Does the peristalsis work of
								itself? Does the secretion work of itself, or is there an intelligence that guides
								and makes the secretions, that guides and forces the peristalsis? This being a fact,
								the intelligence that guides or rules the secretions and peristalsis has ceased
								to do its work, and the calomel simply irritates these ganglia or brain centers
								and stimulates them to renew their former action. If they accept this suggestion
								the patient is cured; if they fail to do so, more suggestion must be given, and
								in many cases the ganglia refuse to accept the suggestion at all and the doctor
								looks wise and gives you a handful more of "stuff."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Mental science
							</p>
							<p>
								The Mental or Christian Scientist, or hypnotist can cure constipation. How does
								he do it? Let us first analyze and find the attributes of constipation. First,
								there is the cerebral attribute, its name, constipation; associated with that are
								the two mind actions of peristalsis and secretion. Those three are now associated
								in the "mind" of man, and the law is that if I lock a thought in the "mind" and
								start it in action, every one of its attributes in its proper place is bound to
								act. Therefore, if I will lock into the mind of a hypnotized subject the thought
								that his bowels are loose, or will move, or arouse any thought there that has associated
								with it the action of peristalsis and secretions, and hold that thought there long
								enough, the result is certain. It is for this reason that a personal suggestion
								or an inspiration in hypnosis has but little effect on a young child. The moment
								it has cerebral attributes associated with sympathetic attributes, and the operator
								knows how to emphasize them, he can get the desired result.
							</p>
							<!-- p 130 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Christian scientists
							</p>
							<p>
								The Christian Scientists tell the patient that he is not sick; then if his mind
								could reason it would say, "If I am not sick, in what condition am I?" But you should
								say to your patient, "You are sick, and so and so will happen," and if the memory
								is there to be aroused the action will take place.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Certainty of action

							<p>
								Remember, in hypnosis or any mental treatment, you can only revive memories, words

								just that certain will the action take place.
