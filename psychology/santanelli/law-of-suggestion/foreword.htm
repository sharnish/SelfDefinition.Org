		/*
        Santanelli, a self-educated hypnotist, was a pioneer of cognitive science but is virtually unknown today. He discovered and explained in a unique manner many of the ideas taught by Gurdjieff, such as how impresions are received and stored, that man has no will and is an automaton.  He published this book in 1902. The esoteric master Richard Rose (an accomplished hypnotist) said that Santanelli was the only author he ever encountered who properly explains the mind.
		
		A long book, but before he gets to the subject of hypnosis he makes some unique comments about how the mind functions.

							<p>
								<em>A word of itself</em> puts no thought into action, though a series of word sense-picturing
								may. Thoughts are made up of associated ideas through the different senses; two
								senses must be affected to put a thought in action. I must arouse a sight memory
								(picture), a feeling memory (picture), as well as a sound through words, to have
								my reader gain a thorough understanding.
							</p>
							<p>
								Though accredited with an extensive vocabulary and having a large dictionary at
								hand, I will have trouble in making you comprehend.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>There are no synonyms</em>, as no two things are the same. Therefore, all words
								used here must have but one meaning. The following words and phrases will be used
								to mean only the here-affixed definitions.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Suggestion,</em> anything that arouses an action (environment, bodily or external).
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Hypnosis,</em> a simulated sleep, the subject having the "thought of sleep."
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Inspiration,</em> a thought forced by an operator after Hypnosis has been induced.
								Man is ruled by suggestion; we inspire a hypnotized subject.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Personal suggestion,</em> where a thought is deliberately forced upon a person
								free from Hypnosis &ndash; exemplified by Christian and Mental Scientists.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Post-hypnotic suggestion,</em> a misnomer. It is a deferred action, and will
								not happen if the subject is actually awakened.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Inspired awakening,</em> "the thought of being awake," commonly known as the
								waking state. The opposite to Hypnosis, "the thought of being asleep."
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Auto-suggestion,</em> can only mean a "sleep walker."
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Pre-inspiration,</em> an act decided upon by the subject to be done after Hypnosis
								has been induced (erroneously called Auto-suggestion).
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Mind,</em> the consensus of all actions acquired during gestation, and seated
								in the Sympathetic System. As it is inconceivable for anything to happen without
								an intelligence to guide it, I believe that intelligence to be within all matter,
								call it Mind, and show its action to be forced by external (the only kind) suggestion.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>"Mind,"</em> what is commonly believed to be the seat of intelligence.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Sympathetic System,</em> all brain matter contra-distinguished from the cerebrum.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thought,</em> two or more associated ideas. Thoughts are forced not chosen.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Idea,</em> a percept through any sense. Ideas transform into action.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Thinking,</em> transforming of energy,&ndash;man only realizes.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Memory,</em> registration of ideas. Man never forgets, but fails to recall.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Negation,</em> an inconceivable word. Everything is positive: positive for or
								positive against.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Abnormal,</em> impossible. Everything is normal or a natural result from the
								cause.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Objective mind, subjective mind,</em> mere words.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Authority,</em> a conceited juggler of words.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Bad,</em> perverted good.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Good,</em> natural response.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, feeling,</em> the correlation of the different
								nerve-end stimuli of the respective organs.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Degenerate,</em> above (plus) or below (minus) what is considered average man.
								Seemingly the same irritation may produce either extreme, subservient to external
								environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Everything is a combination of attributes;</em> i. e., one thing an impossibility.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Matter</em> is comprehensible only to the degree it affects the senses, and
								to be conceived must affect two senses. To be comprehended, three or more.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Form is comprehensible</em> (when acquired) only when it affects sight and feeling.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Form is the outline of matter,</em> and but transitory. Only matter is appreciable.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Man can conceive</em> of nothing greater nor worse than his individual experience.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Will (will power),</em> I cannot comprehend it, though everyone prides himself
								on possessing it.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Instinct,</em> a word used to express intelligence in animals, in contra-distinction
								from intelligence in man. <em>Man reasons!</em> Animals do <span class="nowrap">not.&nbsp;(?)</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Law of Nature,</em> a phrase that conveys no meaning. If you can comprehend
								the phrase "Law of Nature" then you will know the Law of Suggestion, and it will
								be a useless waste of time to read the following pages.
