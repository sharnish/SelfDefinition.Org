								Man's thoughts are made up of the association of the different nerve-end stimulation of the senses. His comprehension is to the extent of his correlated experiences, and all that is possible for him to do is to <em>compare.</em> (See <a href="4-suggestion.htm#indian-story">Indian story</a>, p. 179). His fund of experiences with which to compare is to the degree of the fineness of his nerve-ends to receive all variable impressions so affecting them.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Thinking
							</p>
							<p>
								To try to convey to you my thought, I will use general terms and expressions, thus:
								to say to you what you call "thinking" is nothing but comparing. (Thinking is the
								transformation of energy and afterward realizing the transformation.)
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Psychology
							</p>
							<p>
								Words of themselves force no action; they are meaningless. A word is supposed to
								be a symbol to arouse a sense-memory. To understand the use and application of words
								it is necessary for us to comprehend the action of words in arousing sense-memories.
								Psychology &ndash; as yet a meaningless word &ndash; has been the cause of many well-intending
								non-thinking people writing books that are termed psychologies, which name conveys
								the thought of irrational, incomprehensive theorists, never holding to a premise,
								massing a myriad of words, explaining&nbsp;(?) something that they them-selves do not
								understand, and, consequently, cannot explain, fully demonstrating Talleyrand's
								expression, "Words were given to hide thoughts." <sup>[1]</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. La parole a été donné à l’homme pour déguiser sa pensée.&nbsp;]
							</p>
							<!-- p 217 -->
							<p>
								I believe &ndash; and, dear reader, it is only a belief &ndash; that I possess an average amount
								of so-called human intelligence, and I have yet to read a psychology that I can
								comprehend the least portion of.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Say something
							</p>
							<p>
								Writing words, after stating that words of themselves mean nothing, I will be paradoxical,
								and with words try to say something, a thing that few people succeed in doing. If
								the people in their business and social pursuits would always say something &ndash; making
								affirmations, &ndash; there would be fewer lawsuits, much less misunderstanding; in fact,
								no misunderstanding whatever; but man utters words, and, intuitively comprehending
								that words are meaningless, makes his own deduction; if he deduces correctly we
								call him clever, bright; if incorrectly, a fool.
							</p>
							<p>
								Those of you who have had experience with employes can readily comprehend how hard
								it is to say something, or to have the employes comprehend that you have said something.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Not as you think, but as I say
							</p>
							<p>
								One season there was with me as treasurer a college graduate. When he was engaged,
								I said, "You have not been hired to do the thinking, but to do as I say." In the
								first city we visited, I told him to take a package of school tickets to the public
								schools and give them to the children. He was back in ten minutes.
							</p>
							<div class="tight">
								<p>
									"Where have you been?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"To the school."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Did you give out the tickets to the pupils as I told you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes, sir."
								</p>
								<!-- p 218 -->
								<p>
									"Truly, you can work fast. Now tell me what you actually did?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Oh, I handed the tickets to the teacher, and she said she would give them out to
									the pupils."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Then you did not give the tickets to the pupils, as I told you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Well, I did the same thing."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Another
							</p>
							<p>
								At another time, I told him that every evening after the performance he should write
								to the manager of the company, who was ahead, stating the receipts, and to put the
								letter in the postoffice. A few evenings later, he was in my room when one of my
								subjects was sent out to get some refreshments.
							</p>
							<div class="tight">
								<p>
									The treasurer turned to the boy and said, "Harry, post this letter for me, will
									you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									Harry said, "All right."
								</p>
								<p>
									I interfered and said, "No"; turning to the treasurer, I continued, "Is this what
									I told you to do?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes, sir."
								</p>
								<p>
									"What did I tell you to do?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"To send a letter to the agent every night."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Is that all?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Oh, you said for me to put it in the postoffice, but Harry can do it just as well."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Not just as well
							</p>
							<div class="tight">
								<p>
									"No, not just as well; because if the letter fails to reach its destination, it
									is impossible to place the blame. You failed to do as I told you; Harry is in no
									way responsible; he may do by you as you have done by me, fail to post it."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								Another season I had a treasurer with me who did as he was told. One evening the
								manager of the theater in which we were playing, turned to my treasurer and said,
								"Here is your share of the money; no need to count the tickets."
							</p>
							<!-- p 219 -->
							<p>
								The treasurer had been at the door, seen the tickets sold and was thoroughly convinced
								that all was right, yet had been told to always count the tickets. He began doing
								so, and the manager of the theater said, "What is the use? It is just a waste of
								time. I do not care to rob you; here's your share of the money."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								As he was told
							</p>
							<p>
								The treasurer answered, "Mr. Santanelli told me to always count the tickets, and
								I shall do so."
							</p>
							<p>
								At the conclusion of the count, my treasurer remarked to the manager of the house
								that his tickets called for thirty dollars more.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Impossible," replied the manager of the opera house.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I know nothing of that; I have tickets here representing thirty dollars more than
								you claim you have," replied my treasurer.
							</p>
							<p>
								After much worrying, the treasurer of the opera house suddenly remarked, "By George,
								I forgot the advance sale."
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, the treasurer of the hall was honest, but if my treasurer had not done as he
								was told I would have been out twenty-four dollars.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Don't
							</p>
							<p>
								Everything in life is affirmative; all else is incomprehensible. "Don't" is a positive
								against you. If I say to you, "Don't do that," I mean, "Keep still," or to do something
								else. When I speak to you of "long," what do you think of, dear reader? Long?
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Positiveness
							</p>
							<p>
								Oh, no; you think of short, because it is the realization of short and the comparison
								of that with long which makes the difference. When I say to you, "Smith is fat,"
								you think of lean. Now, if I say to you, "Smith is not fat," I arouse and put in
								action in your "mind" the thought of a lean man. If I say to you, "The man is fat"
								you think of lean, but fat is the dominant idea.
							</p>
							<!-- p 220 -->
							<p>
								Grammarians will tell us the following sentence is correct: "See the young man put
								to sleep in the opera house Monday night; after which he will be taken to Smith's
								show window, where you may see him sleeping; and, on Wednesday, see him awakened
								in the opera house." It is entirely incorrect. It is like putting the right glove
								on the left hand; it does not fit.
							</p>
							<p>
								The proper writing of the sentence would be: "See the young man put to sleep in
								the opera house on Monday evening; see him awakened on Wednesday evening; and, in
								the meantime, see him sleeping in Smith's show window."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Extremes side by side
							</p>
							<p>
								The idea I am trying to convey is this: That when I talk of putting a person to
								sleep, the first idea aroused is of his awakening, and the two extremes should be
								placed side by side, the modifications to come afterward. Where the modifications
								come between the two extremes it is very difficult of comprehension and for the
								hearer to remember; but if the extremes are placed side by side the glove would
								be snugly fitted to the hand that it was made for. To acquire this art is very difficult
								after being schooled as we have. I fail to obey it in this book.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								$100
							</p>
							<p>
								I speak to you of one hundred dollars; do you comprehend what I am talking about? What sense-picture have I aroused in your mind? One of a piece of paper with a figure one and two ciphers in the corner, and the other associated figures; nothing more.
							</p>
							<!-- p 221 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Can comprehend but three
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The "mind" can comprehend but three units at one time.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								For years I have wondered why the unaccountable has appeared in every art and science,
								To-day it is perfectly comprehensible to me, because man can comprehend but three.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you doubt this, look at the signs when going down the street; we comprehend two
								or three letters the moment we glance at them, but if there be four or five, we
								at once comprehend the first three and then the balance, if the group does not contain
								more than six. Some learn to do this very quickly.
							</p>
							<p>
								If we are looking at a party of three on the street corner, and I ask you how many
								there are, you will immediately tell me; if there are six, you will say six, provided
								they are divided into groups of three; the same with nine; but, if they are in one
								group, they must be counted; or, in other words, separated into groups of three.
							</p>
							<p>
								A little experimenting will very readily demonstrate this. It is so simple and easily
								conceived &ndash; if you will make a series of fair experiments &ndash; that I wonder why our
								alleged scientists have not discovered it ere now. Any quantity over three is abstract;
								it is a mere term. If I speak of one hundred thousand feet of lumber, what picture
								am I arousing in the "mind?" None. A man who is accustomed to handling lumber might
								conceive the space it would occupy. If he is a wood-chopper he might conceive the
								energy and time necessary to cut and saw this lumber; but to conceive it as one
								hundred thousand feet is utterly impossible.
							</p>
							<p>
								We hear of speculators in Wall Street buying a million bushels of wheat, and look
								wise, believing that we comprehend what was said. We have no comprehension; nor
								has he who purchased it. Perhaps the men who have large grain elevators have a conception
								of it as to bulk, as to the space it would occupy, measured by the eye, but no comprehension is possible.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Comprehension
							</p>
							<p>
								I speak to you of space, an incomprehensible word; I speak to you of spirit; that
								is also incomprehensible. Form is merely the outline of matter, and it requires
								two senses to acquire conception &ndash; sight and feeling &ndash; or, in other words, two forms
								of feeling. Man can comprehend only by associating what he has seen, smelled, tasted,
								heard or felt. It is impossible to register through one sense that which the economy
								of man built to register through another; hence, it is impossible for me to give
								you through the ear a smelling, tasting, sight or feeling memory; but one already
								possessed may be readily aroused.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Words arouse memories indefinitely
							</p>
							<p>
								Words arouse memories indefinitely. When used in association with the affecting
								of other senses, words put thoughts in action that form new combinations or associations,
								thereby forcing new forms of thought. Taking up the illustration of man being a
								camera, taking a picture, the hypnotized subject being a stereopticon throwing out
								a picture, the "mind" can only hold one of these pictures at a time, and a negation
								always forces the opposite picture into place. It is possible, however, to take
								a minor attribute of a picture and make it dominate the picture.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Convincing
							</p>
							<p>
								The art of doing this is what is called proving to, or convincing persons, and forcing
								them to think your way. (Making the indefinite definite.)
							</p>
							<p>
								To illustrate, we will take the fishing scene. I tell the subjects that when they
								open their eyes they will find themselves alongside of a fishing stream; that they
								will see beside them, bait, lines and hooks; that there are some fine fish in the
								stream they are welcome to if they can catch, and they commence fishing. But, if
								I say to them, "You must not swear," or "refrain from swearing, as there are ladies
								in the audience," the word "audience" revives the picture of where they were when
								they went into hypnosis; consequently, I have lost the thought I attempted to give
								them. But if I keep within the picture and say, "there is a party of ladies fishing
								a little way down the stream," the subjects will fish.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, reader, can we still keep them within the picture of the fishing scene and
								force them to cease fishing? I suppose you would say no, inasmuch as they are surrounded
								with all the attributes of fishing, and, not being free agents, they would be forced
								to fish.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Emphasizing a minor attribute
							</p>
							<p>
								Very true, but an attribute which, of itself, must be a combination of other attributes,
								can be so divided &ndash; emphasized &ndash; that it will practically rule the picture. Therefore,
								if I would add to the fishing scene a very severe rain storm, carrying with it the
								disagreeableness of being wet, the danger of sickness, a place of cover, et cetera,
								it would force these fishermen to seek shelter, and still be within the fishing
								picture.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								A lawyer
							</p>
							<p>
								If I were a lawyer, never would I try to prove or show a negation, or the negative
								side of a case. Defending a criminal, I would accept every fact proven by the prosecution,
								accepting its premises "good," and would build on it better, best.
							</p>
							<p>
								We will assume that a young man has been arrested for beating his mother, and the
								mother appears in court with a bruised face, black eye, et cetera. Knowing the jury
								can comprehend nothing they have not experienced through their senses, we must arouse
								in them sense-memories with which they are thoroughly familiar; that we must always
								impress two senses; that when we picture to them with words the hovel wherein he
								was reared, we must also speak of feeling, of smell; otherwise the mere mention
								of a hovel, a sight picture, will lack in effect; but if we properly associate with
								the sight picture feeling memories, smell memories, we will have succeeded not only
								in arousing a thought but have put it in action.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the defendant's attorney, I would admit that the boy beat his mother, and state
								that it was the natural outcome of the environment. I would show the early surroundings
								of the boy, and the way his mother guided and allowed him to adapt himself to those
								environments to his injury; that as he grew up she continued to cultivate and allow
								to accumulate ideas and actions perfectly consistent with the beating given by her
								son. Inasmuch as no other result could possibly happen under such environment, nothing
								else could be expected of the young man; he responded as all others would under
								like conditions.
							</p>
							<p>
								This argument, being thoroughly developed by the association of the different sense-pictures,
								would create a sympathetic feeling for my client, and could not do otherwise than
								cause the jury to comprehend that the action was the natural outcome; or, to put
								it very brutally, the mother deserved what she got.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Natural response
							</p>
							<p>
								If you were a customer, desiring to buy goods of me, and I should say to you, "This
								is the best thing on the market," what would you be thinking of? That there are
								bad things on the market. Then, what proof have I that this is the best? As a good,
								wise purchaser you will go to some other store to look around, and I prove myself
								to be a very bad salesman by the use of one word.
							</p>
							<p>
								If I was an insurance man, and some one told me that he had insurance in another
								company, and I said that it was bad, what would you be thinking of? "Who in the
								mischief has any good?" But if I should say to him, "That company is good, but we
								have something a little better," always taking our opponent's side as good &ndash; then
								better and best, we are keeping within the picture; then, if we can take the minor
								attributes and split them up, they can be made to dominate the picture as the rain
								storm did the fishing scene, and thereby carry conviction.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Proper personal suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								If you were a writer of accident insurance and had climbed to the top of a high
								building, there meeting a carpenter, I suppose you would say to him, "It would be
								quite dangerous to fall from here." I would not; but would look him in the eye,
								then at the ground and ask how far it was, and the other ideas would be immediately
								forced into action. I might then say something about how often people fall, or ask
								him if he ever fell. I will promise you that by following out this line, if, in
								ten minutes he was asked to be insured, and had the money, he would be.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Realize
							</p>
							<p>
								The art of talking is to know what and how to accentuate, to force the listener
								to make <em>your</em> argument <em>himself.</em> The mere statement of fact produces
								no result; but suggestion, properly applied, will cause the hearer to evolve what
								you evolved, to separate the attributes that you have separated, and, by so doing,
								will convince himself (realize). He will have emphasized through the proper channels
								the associated attributes favorable to you. Always talk in affirmatives, using a
								positive for, and thus hold the picture in your hearer's mind.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Actors
							</p>
							<p>
								An actor does not act. He leads his auditors; they do their own acting. How is it
								possible for Bill Jones, who has never experienced the different emotions that Hamlet
								is supposed to have had, to <em>reproduce</em> them? How can his mind reproduce
								something that he has not experienced? Acting, so-called, carries with it no conviction,
								nothing real. The successful actor is one who can force his auditors to do their
								own acting. The attributes, scenery, music, costumes and wordpicturing, merely arouse
								a memory in the auditor. I have seen "Camille" played by an actress and company
								talking entirely in Italian, and enjoyed it better without comprehending a word,
								than any performance of that play I had ever witnessed in the English language.
							</p>
							<p>
								If our actors would devote more study to emphasis and leading their auditors, they
								would succeed far better than they do at the present day by trying to simulate (trying
								to reproduce something they have never experienced), which is an impossibility.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								The Lord's prayer
							</p>
							<p>
								Many of the incongruities in the Bible are now comprehensible to me, the translators
								failing to convey the original through the translation. For example, take a correct
								translation of the Lord's Prayer, and see how different the meaning from the one
								you have learned:
							</p>
							<p>
								"Our Father Who are in Heaven, we hallow Thy name that Thy Kingdom may come and
								that Thy will may be done, here upon earth, even as it is in Heaven. Give us, day
								after day, our necessities, and forgive us our debts as we ought to forgive our
								debtors; leading us out of temptation and delivering us from evil. For Thine is
								the power as also the kingdom, forever and eternity. Amen."
							</p>
							<p>
								Note the entire absence of negation.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								The devil
							</p>
							<p>
								The word "don't" is the cause of more sin than his Satanic Majesty ever conceived;
								for, in fact, this word is the devil.
							</p>
							<p>
								The ten commandments have been the cause of, and are responsible for, more sin than
								they have ever prevented.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								The Indian and missionary
							</p>
							<p>
								I was born in the extreme west, in Oregon. My grandfather walked across the plains
								in 1840, and was well acquainted with the Indians. He, with other pioneers, always
								had a great dislike for missionaries. I asked him why, and he said they caused all
								the trouble with the Indians. How was that? The Indians were good and peaceable
								as long as the white man treated them justly. When the missionary came among them
								and said, "Don't steal," the Indian asked, "What is 'don't steal' "? and the good
								missionary explained it to him; the Indian said, "Why, I never thought of that,
								guess I will try it." The advent of missionaries is always associated in the "minds"
								of the early pioneers with the beginning of thievery on the part of the Indians.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Murder
							</p>
							<p>
								The mother says to her children, "Now, little ones, I am going out. I want you to
								be good, and, while I am gone, don't play with the fire." Up to this time the thought
								of fire was composed of the attributes that it gave forth heat, that it would burn.
								In fact, these were the only attributes they had of fire other than the comfort
								to be derived from its heat. For the first time, the mother now associates with
								the thought of fire that it is something to be played with, and the moment she goes
								out, responding to her suggestion, the thought of playing with the fire is aroused
								in the "minds" of the children, and they begin playing with it and are burned, perhaps
								to death.
							</p>
							<p>
								According to the just laws of to-day, that mother should be arrested for infanticide.
								She has unintentionally killed her children by speaking the words, "Don't play with
								the fire," and is just as guilty of their death, as though she left a can of nitroglycerin
								for them to play with. If we wish children to keep from the fire, we should say
								to them, "Now, little ones, move all your toys over in this corner of the room;
								I want you to play here until I come back."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Say something
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>We have said something.</em> It was all affirmative. We told them what we desired
								them to do, not what we desired them not to do. Every time we use the word "don't,"
								we make a positive affirmation against ourselves. Mothers are so small-minded
								that they believe their daughters to be as experienced as themselves &ndash; in bad &ndash;
								always harping to them "Don't do this, that and the other," things that up to this
								time the girls never thought of. Many girls are ruined by their mothers trying to
								make them good through their "don'ts," arousing a series of ideas just contrary
								to those desired.

								Ministers' sons
							</p>
							<p>
								Why is it that ministers' sons are proverbially "bad"? Because sin is being instilled
								in their minds by the constant mention of sinful acts, preceded by the word "don't,"
								the good father always striving to find "badness" which he tells the son not to
								do, thus telling him of sins hitherto unthought of.

								an affirmative against, or the opposite to what you are trying to say. Learn to
								say something. Here is a common expression, "I will not see you until to-morrow."
								That is not what you intend saying, you intend to say that you will see me to-morrow.

								A child is playing in the street, and you say to it, "Don't play in the street."

								you intend to say is, "Come in out of the rain." Say something and perhaps your

								Learning to lie
							</p>
							<p>
								The tone in which a word is uttered is of more importance than the word itself. To illustrate: A mother says to her child, "If you don't stop that, I'll whip you." The child continues, seeing in the mother's face an expression which, associated with the tone, plainly says "continue," as they have forced a continuance of the thought, being positive against the words uttered. After a few years, the mother says to her husband, "We must remove from this locality, as the neighbors' children are teaching ours to lie." (Do you see it?)

								Teachers
							</p>
							<p>
								Many times have I lectured before the pupils of the normal schools in many states,
								and must say that I found the mode of teaching the most ridiculous attempt at instruction
								imaginable. If I had a ten-year-old boy, reared with me, who did not possess more
								actual knowledge than any of the pupils I have lectured before in the normal schools,
								I would be tempted to spank him, or to send him to an institution for the imbecile.
								These poor would-be teachers, having no experience in life, seated day after day
								on a bench, having words poured into their ears without the association of the other
								senses, it being impossible to get a conception with less than two, or a comprehension
								without affecting three senses &ndash; and one sense only, their hearing being affected,
								the words poured into their ears are merely idle ones, and then these poor creatures
								are supposed to go out into the world to teach children that, which they, themselves,
								have failed to comprehend. Not the fault of the teachers, but the fault of the scientific
								&nbsp;(?) manner of teaching.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Scientific teaching
							</p>
							<p>
								Our teachers show us (through the eye) how to do something which they do through
								the feeling sense. Our eyes cannot accept feeling memories. You show&nbsp;(?) me how
								to pare an apple? No, you allow me to see you pare an apple. Schools, other than
								those of manual training, are failures.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here is a suggestion that will make a fortune for some ingenious lover of children.
								Make a set of the letters of the alphabet in pieces, each to fit only in its proper
								place; have the joints of a pronounced angle, curve or square, so that the child
								can be taught to fit, correlate, "think"; to learn that an acute angle will not
								fit a right angle or circle, et cetera. The moment the child has learned this, it
								has learned to "think," and not before. When this has been learned, the child will
								instantly, from out the heap, pick the parts (attributes) that form the letter.
								Reader, if you had such an alphabet, you could not instantly do so. You are not
								a ready thinker.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Pictures
							</p>
							<p>
								Pictures are false, one has to be taught to read them. Showing a child a picture
								of a cow, saying "cow," associating form&nbsp;(?) and sound, starts the thought, but
								not of the real cow. After a child has seen a real cow, the picture may recall the
								true memory. A picture is only a word. Writing arouses sound memory, and a picture
								arouses sight memory, but the real thing must first be registered in the memory.
							</p>
							<p>
								I knew a lad of twelve years exceptionally bright, who went into the country, looked
								at a cow for five minutes, and said, "That must be a cow." This lad had exceptionally
								fine tutors and opportunities for learning, yet it took him five minutes to deduce
								that he was looking at a cow. The suggestion of the environment did more to force
								the conviction than anything that he had seen pictured.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Train the proper senses
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Tell the children what to do.</em> All thoughts are composed of sense impressions,
								therefore impress the proper senses. I may watch a blacksmith for a lifetime, yet
								cannot make a horseshoe until my sense of feeling acquires the proper memory. Three
								senses must be affected to form a comprehensive thought.

								My New York expose&nbsp;(?)
							</p>
							<p>
								After my New York City engagement, the most sensational expose&nbsp;(?) was effected.
								The fellow who did so thought I had then left for Lansing, Michigan. I met his first
								attempt, which was a failure. After I did leave, he succeeded in furnishing the
								New York papers with some sensational stories. The exposes&nbsp;(?) were made as to the
								sleeping act (hibernation). The first proof of the falsity of his statements is
								that he never made a sleep for me. Only these sleeps were made during my Eastern
								tour, viz.: In New York, Kilmer; Hartford, Conn., Stevenson; New Haven, Conn., Slinker;
								Meriden, Conn., Leonard; Bridgeport, Conn., Kilmer; Willimantic, Conn., Mahoney.
							</p>
							<p>
								My advent in New York was as follows: I arrived in New York City with some six subjects,
								and opened in the Herald Square theater one afternoon, before about six hundred
								doctors; demonstrating with my subjects many things that were contradictions to
								what the medical profession taught, particularly the three different rates of pulsation,
								simultaneously. The subjects were stripped to the waist, allowing no possibility
								of trickery, and this test done some three or four times with each. Some of the
								doctors claimed that the subjects were trained.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Heart does not control the circulation
							</p>
							<p>
								Even now, I will not control admit that for the sake of argument, but it still proves my point, that the heart does not control the circulation; <em>otherwise it could not be trained.</em> Just so, some people say the subjects are not hypnotized. Still, if they were not hypnotized they are in a condition, and whatever that condition is, I call it hypnotized. I will not fight for the term, words mean but little.
							</p>
							<p>
								I then opened at Hammerstein's Olympia theater. My managers informed me that when
								people in New York City visited the theater, they went to see a show, not to take
								part in it; that volunteers were impossible; that I had better get some subjects.
								I put an advertisement in one of the papers, had many applicants, and on a Sunday
								afternoon I hypnotized some sixty, put them to work and picked out the better ones,
								to whom I paid one dollar a performance.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, if they were "fakers," they demonstrated themselves to be more clever than
								any actors in New York City, and they should have been drawing three hundred dollars
								per week; but, through the "fake," or whatever you want to call it, I possessed
								the ability to make great actors out of this raw material in one hour, and at one
								dollar per night.
							</p>
							<p>
								You, gentle reader, say, "Ah, you are clever." No, when you claim that you say I
								am a fool, because it is certain that if I could so teach people, Manager Frohman
								would hire me at an enormous salary as a stage manager to furnish him with actors
								at one dollar per night. I am very certain that if I am so clever, and could rehearse
								and teach these subjects to do as they did in the brief time I had, the schools
								of acting in New York City would pay me a large salary to either work for them or
								to keep out of the business.
							</p>
							<p>
								This degenerate, who made the alleged expose, was the chum of a Bowery professor
								then giving exhibitions in a dime museum in Fourteenth Street. His chum failed to
								teach him to take on hypnosis. After thirteen hours, an hour each day, I succeeded
								in teaching this fellow to take on hypnosis, after which he proved to be a clever
								subject. I took him on the road with me, and in two of the cities we visited, had
								to send him out of town to prevent his being arrested. To-day, the police of Bridgeport
								have, pigeon-holed, a criminal warrant against him.
							</p>
							<p>
								In his expose, he claims to have visited Europe; to have been used in exhibitions
								by Charcot and others. I doubt if he has been six miles at sea; and Charcot gave
								none but private demonstrations, and those with only inmates of the Hospital Salpetriere.
								He went to the newspapers and stated that he was not hypnotized; that he was "faking,"
								and asked the reporters to say to him, "Drowsy, sleepy, et cetera," as Santanelli
								did; that he would go to sleep, stick pins into himself and become cataleptic. I
								can teach any subject to do this thing in three minutes, in fact, I can do it myself
								through a pre-inspiration, and at no time do I need to thoroughly lose consciousness.
								Later on, he made a twenty-four hour sleep to show that he could simulate it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, dear reader, did you ever wake up on a Sunday morning too late for breakfast
								and try to go to sleep, to lie there until lunch-time. I will promise that before
								lunch-time you will get up. You cannot lie awake five minutes with your eyes closed.
								You cannot lie abed all day if you are well and awake. I will give a thousand dollars
								to the man who, free from hypnosis or drugs, will sit in a crowd for three minutes
								without opening his eyes.
							</p>
							<p>
								This clever lad told how the bed was full of tubes to supply him with food; how
								ham sandwiches were handed to him. Oh, no; I am too clever for anything like that,
								if I had wanted to feed him, would have given him food in capsules or tablets. Just
								imagine a man eating ham sandwiches lying on his back for seven days. If not digested,
								they would kill him; if digested, the functions must be active.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now comes the strange part. This clever&nbsp;(?) fellow, like the clever&nbsp;(?) public,
								told all about the eating, never once mentioning thirst. Man can go fifty or sixty
								days without food, but must have liquids. Being for seventy-two hours without water
								or liquids will always produce insanity, except through hypnosis. In these exposes
								nothing has ever been said as to the method used to give
								<!-- end p 236 -->
								<!-- Plate V follows -->
								them water. Nothing has been said as to the emptying of the bladder. If food is
								taken into the stomach and digested, the secretions must be at work; if the secretions
								are at work, the bowels will move. These things were all overlooked in these exposes;
								the stories were told of tubes in the bed, as to procuring food, et cetera, but
								nothing was said of how the subject's system was freed of the waste from the food
								given him.

							<p class="sidenote">
								No desire for contradictory facts
							</p>
							<p>
								A story was told of his lying in a cage; this act I have never performed, but have
								proposed it, agreeing, if the profession desired such a test, to lay a naked subject
								on a sheet on a bed, put a cage over all, and seal it to the floor so as to demonstrate
								that nothing was passed to the subject; but the wise and learned medical profession
								cared for no test that demonstrated, through suggestion, the possibility of suspending
								hunger, thirst, bowel and kidney action; such knowledge they did not care to learn
								as it contradicted their teachings.
							</p>
							<p>
								During the New York sleep, made by Kilmer, he was watched night and day by relays
								of students from Bellevue Hospital. When arrangements were being made, one student,
								who hoped to graduate that spring, insisted on having charge of the entire affair,
								which, finally, was agreed upon. I had nothing to do with the arrangements, which
								were made by my manager, whom I had only known a week. If it were a "fake," it is
								strange that I should allow the details to be handled by a stranger.
							</p>
							<p>
								This would-be doctor took charge of the sleeper, stayed up some forty-eight hours,
								when off watch, hiding in a box to catch us feeding him. On the Wednesday night
								when he stood before the audience and told them that the experiment was fair, and
								that I had done as claimed, he was very angry. When he took charge, he told his
								chums that he would expose the fraud and thereby get a big advertisement for himself
								when he began practicing, but when he found out there was no fraud to expose, he
								regretted the loss of sleep and the time wasted; and later presented a bill to me
								for services rendered, which bill as yet is unreceipted.
							</p>
							<!-- p 238 -->
							<p>
								The thought that a man with a "fake" would, could or dared to open at Hammerstein's
								with the proposition that I made is ridiculous. The sleeper to be examined, weighed,
								and watched from being naked to putting on a sound pair of silk tights, a silk shirt,
								a pair of silk pajamas, to lie on a large mattress covered with a crumb cloth (all
								previously examined), and for no one but the committee to touch the subject, I not
								going nearer than five feet from him (giving my exhibition on the stage would bring
								me that close). The thought of it being other than genuine could only appear in
								the "mind" of an ignoramus, or some one looking for newspaper notoriety.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Tests of no value
							</p>
							<p>
								During the test of a twenty-four hour sleep made for the New York Herald (no test
								being of any value of less than seventy-two hours), the wise doctors who knew nothing
								of hypnosis, tested this subject as to his feeling.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Feeling vs. hypnosis
							</p>
							<p>
								For Heaven's sake, what has feeling to do with hypnosis? They stuck pins into him,
								they dropped water on his eyelids; they put him through all kinds of torture, but
								through pure fortitude&nbsp;(?) he stood it. When this is possible all laws of suggestion
								can be overcome. When "normally," a man can control what the doctor calls his reflexes,
								he is worthy of more money than he got out of the alleged expose.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								A good liar
							</p>
							<!-- p 239 -->
							<p>
								One wise&nbsp;(?) doctor called to him that there were rats in the room, and because
								the subject did not respond, said he was not in hypnosis, because the hypnotized
								subject responds to "suggestion." Why, if the subject could hear and respond to
								him he would be awake, because that is what constitutes the waking state. The subject
								did not hear him, did not respond to him, thereby proving that he was in hypnosis.
								After the subject was awakened, they asked him if he did not suffer severe pain
								while they dropped water on his eyes; and, like a good liar, he said, "Yes," the
								answer being put into his mouth by the question asked.
							</p>
							<p>
								Why, if he suffered from the dropping of the water on his eyelids the reflexes would
								have acted, the doctors would have seen it, and the subject could not have endured
								it. But this subject knew what he was up against, that the doctors were not testing
								him as to hypnosis, but were simply there to prove their views as to suggested anesthesia,
								he taking the pre-inspiration that he would sleep for the twenty-four hours and
								suffer no pain, which he did.

							</p>
							<p>The wise&nbsp;(?) doctors named everything that he did
								and then asked him a question; or, in other words, they put the answers in his mouth,
								which he gave them, taking his word for it that he could endure pain and suspend
								his reflex actions without hypnosis. These doctors knew this to be an impossibility,
								yet the desire for newspaper notoriety was so strong that they pretended to accept
								this degenerate's word. Assuming that he could do so, proved nothing. Lack of feeling
								is not hypnosis. How can a man prove or disprove something which he knows nothing
								about? I, myself, could prove no hypnotist to be a fake; all that would be possible
								for me to do would be to force the hypnotist to produce a phenomenon that would
								be satisfactory to me.
							</p>
							<!-- p 240 -->
							<p>
								I perform many operations on hypnotized subjects. The two severest are the stretching
								of the rectum and the cutting around the tender phrenum. With the first I always
								get a groan, with the other a very pronounced reflex action, and yet when the subject
								awakens he remembers nothing of it. The extent of pre-inspiration I do not know,
								but in my long years of experience, have met with but three, viz.: no feeling, rigidity,
								awakening.
							</p>
							<p>
								These alleged exposes have all been good advertising, inasmuch as intelligent people
								are in no hurry to take the word of one who has nothing at stake against one who
								has everything.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Poor man
							</p>
							<p>
								The wisdom&nbsp;(?) of the general public is highly amusing. If you want to feel sorry
								for mankind stand in front of a show-window where a subject is asleep. A certain
								percentage of these know he is not asleep, "because he is placed there;" the next
								is certain he is not asleep because he moves (no man moves in his sleep); and some
								ladies are certain to go by and claim he is not asleep because he breathes. These
								three are the chief explanations as to why the subject is not asleep.
							</p>
							<p>Everybody
								asks how he is fed, and will he not be hungry when he awakens? No one appreciates
								the absence of thirst. If everything is a combination of attributes, a condition
								or combination must be produced in the subject that has these functions suspended.
								The suspension of hunger and bowel action are easily explained, but I have no
								explanation to offer as to the suspending of thirst and kidney action, knowing only that
								with a subject who has perfect confidence in me I can suspend the four functions
								for a period of seven days and longer.
							</p>
							<!-- p 241 -->
							<p>
								My subject will awaken in a bright and strong condition; his bladder will be perfectly
								empty and the first drink of water he takes will pass through him within ten minutes.
								The subject is lying in hypnosis, with the thought that he will have no hunger,
								no thirst, no bowel or kidney action, and will awaken on the seventh day. This thought
								being locked in the "mind," the action that is part of it is certain to take place.
							</p>
							<p>
								This sleeping act was suggested to me in Xenia, Ohio, by a child asking about the
								picture of a bear sleeping all winter in a cave. It occurring to me that if a bear
								could "sleep" all winter, a man could sleep a week. I experimented and succeeded.
							</p>
							<p>
								While lecturing in New York City, as a rule I concluded my lecture by giving some
								demonstrations with a subject, and also having a subject pre-inspire himself with
								the thought of "no feeling," and stick pins into himself, demonstrating my claims
								as to the so-called Auto-suggestion of the alleged exposers. After doing this at
								a lecture one night, an old "horse" came upon the platform and informed me that
								he could stick pins into himself.

								While I was getting my wraps, the president of the society for whom I was lecturing

								What is the use of trying to teach the people anything? After you read this book,
								I am afraid that you will know but little more than you did before you started,
								as it is impossible to put in through one sense what "nature" intended to put in
								through another. It seems that the president of this society, although seeing the
								demonstration made, was not satisfied until he had lost a five-dollar bill. The
								same with you reading this book unless you take a subject (providing you are capable),
								and demonstrate to yourself the truth I have told, you have simply absorbed a lot
								of words, which, of themselves, mean nothing.
							</p>
							<p>
								I know one very brilliant man who, notwithstanding he acknowledged that expression
								was the result of thought, that there could be no expression without thought, turned
								around and asserted that he believed a subject could "fake." What to do with such
								people, how to convince them I do not know. Man's comprehension is only to the extent
								of his experience. Try to simulate and see if it is possible; try to laugh and put
								the real ring into it, and see if you can; try to cry and see if you can get the
								tone.
							</p>
							<p>
								I spend months conceiving a condition possible to be produced in a subject, sometimes
								doing much experimenting to find the proper inspiration to give him to produce the
								result desired, and any hypnotist who will have the inspiration taken in shorthand,
								can repeat the experiment, stealing the result of my thought, yet they never give
								me credit for any of my originations.
							</p>
							<!-- p 243 -->
							<p>
								I did the sleeping act a year before any hypnotist ever dreamed of reproducing it.
								In fact, until they had taken subjects who had traveled with me and had learned
								how to give the inspiration, they were doubtful as to its being accomplished, and,
								with the general public, believed it to be a trick. They are welcome to the inspirations,
								yet it is no more than just that they should give me credit for them.

								without doing so, failing to appreciate that I possess knowledge of a law, and am
								not, like them, working in the dark; that my physiology is correct, and neither
								myself nor the subject I am experimenting with are taking any chances.
							</p>
							<p>
								I direct the temperature of a subject so low that an ordinary clinical thermometer
								will fail to register it, thus proving that the accepted theory that combustion
								produces the heat of the body is wrong. When I reported this to a certain hospital,
								the wink was passed around, none of them daring to contradict me, inasmuch as they
								knew I had always succeeded in making good my claims. It happened the night that
								one of the internes, who was quite a clever amateur, had begun his vacation, and
								he accomplished in twenty-four hours what I did in twenty minutes; yet I had to
								conceive it was possible to do so. Our physiologists are wrong from beginning to
								end, and I state this unreservedly.

							<p>
								In New York, when I explained that "no feeling" was produced by the sympathetic
								nerves closing over the cerebral nerve-ends and insulating them, it was declared,
								"Very ingenious, but very unscientific." Thank Heaven for that! All drug anesthesia

								Our so-called consciousness is not of itself greater than that of other "living"
								matter. We are simply a conglomeration of lesser form of life, and nothing more.
								By what right, through what sense proof, do we dare to place ourselves above That
								of which we are; That, that gave us our parts, attributes; That, that continues
								to supply and relieve us, lest we disintegrate? How dare we claim to be other
								than of our environment; of the whole, the all, God, good?
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Spirit and soul
							</p>
							<p>
								We have no conception or comprehension of spirit, soul; they are but words. The
								soul, the spirit, if it be, must naturally be of the ALL. And yet we dare to assume
								it to be inherent in ourselves, and to be separate gods of our own. No, no, that
								cannot be; like Caesar we are too ambitious, and like Caesar, we will fall.
							</p>
							<p>
								This may seem harsh; yet truth, though it hurts, never injures.

								A disturber
							</p>
							<p>
								He who comes among us with something "new," is a disturber, and, therefore, should
								be crushed. The Nazarene was crucified, not by the Jews, although they were afraid
								of him. They said, "He is of us, and a disturber. We will suffer if He continues."
								Pontius Pilate, representing the authorities at Rome, killed Him for disturbing
								the accustomed ways.

								Gallileo was banished.

								Jean Jacques Rosseau was pursued from hamlet to hamlet; yet were it not for him,
								there would be no United States of America, or Republic of France. He gathered the
								thought and gave it to the world.

								Like a broad highway
							</p>
							<p>
								Life is a broad highway where the masses follow; perhaps twice, and never more than
								three times in a century, some one strays away, out of the highway, and
								starts over the mountain. The moment he has gone far enough for the masses to see
								him, they call, "Come back, you fool, you will be lost!" and if he fails to turn,
								<em>they stone him</em> "to attract his attention," or to kill him lest he be lost
								and die. The world, the masses, are kind&nbsp;(?), they want to protect the "fool" from
								destroying <em>himself</em>; they would rather destroy him. After the "fool" has
								successfully crossed the mountain, another "fool" follows in his pathway; soon more
								"fools" follow, and at last the masses go, each and every one saying, "I knew he
								would cross all right, he was too 'smart' a fellow to attempt crossing if he was
								not sure of getting there."
							</p>
							<p>
								This is history.
							</p>
							<p>
								Why was this book written? I am a fatalist, believing that what is, was to have
								been; that our duty is to impart, to lead others over the path we have discovered,
								and if we can only make that pathway clear to a few "fools" who will follow as we
								have gone, I believe I will have responded to my suggestion. I believe myself to
								be blessed with at least "fair" conception, and to quote from Omar Khayyam:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									"Myself when young did eagerly frequent<br>
									Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument<br>
									About it and about: but ever more<br>
									Came out by the same door wherein I went."
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								I love man, and, through my hypnotic experience, found that he was not as described
								by our scientific thinkers&nbsp;(?), so began to study him in my unscientific way, and
								having learned somewhat of him, am forced to offer to the world this thought as
								to the Law of Suggestion.

								First, place your subject, then give him the attributes. Reader, this book is written
								to place you. Should more attributes be desired, they will be furnished you.
							</p>
							<p>
								Man does not choose; he knows of no ill until he has conceived of good. He must
								be led; and it is the duty of man, after conceiving, to lead his fellow man.
