								Story of Lily
							</p>
							<p>
								A few summers ago, I spent some four months with a family in Ohio, studying particularly
								a three-year-old daughter of the woman employed to do the housework. The child dined
								at the table with the others of the family, was very fat, having chops like a monkey
								and eyes like a pig, and the mother made it her special duty to stuff the child.
								When the child's eyes wandered around the table more food was given her, and when
								she said she had enough her mother insisted on her having a little more. I asked
								why this was, and the mother replied that she had had a hard time getting enough
								to eat, so she was going to be sure that the child had enough. I said, "Madam, you
								are ruining the child, you are making of her a hog."
							</p>
							<p>
								She replied, "No, the child is all right."
							</p>
							<p>
								The child simply was a two-legged hog.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								The routine
							</p>
							<p>
								The day's routine was something as follows: Being accustomed all my life to staying
								up nights, I rarely fall asleep until daylight, and get the better part of my sleep
								in the forenoons. At nine a. m., I would hear, "Lily, Lily, come in out of that,
								or I will spank you." In a few minutes a repetition would occur, and I would hear
								Lily being spanked. The child seemed to enjoy the spanking, and it simply wallowed
								in the dirt. At noon the mother would change the child's frock, complaining of the
								many frocks soiled and how dirty she became, stuffed her little belly full of food
								and put the child on the sofa to sleep, which it would do until about four p. m.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Hog nature
							</p>
							<p>
								The child would then get up, wallow in the dirt, soil another slip, and at night
								the mother would stuff her again. After supper the mother would undress her, wash
								her and put her to bed. At about one a. m., we would hear, "Mamma, mamma, dink,
								mamma." The mother, who ate as vigorously as the child, slept like a hog and was
								hard to arouse. So little Lily would call, "Mamma, mamma, dink, mamma," until the
								mother awoke and gave her a drink of water; the child would then sleep till morning.
								The same repetition day in and day out. Lily's greatest pleasure was rolling on
								her belly in the dirt.
							</p>
							<p>
								In about a month the mother took a vacation of two weeks, leaving the child with
								the family. I immediately asked the lady of the house if she would treat the child
								my way for a couple of weeks and see what would be the result. She acquiesced.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								An experiment
							</p>
							<p>
								"First of all, place on the child's plate a reasonable amount of food, about one-quarter
								of what the mother is in the habit of giving her, and the moment the child's eyes
								wander around the table to see something to tempt her appetite, dismiss her." We
								began, and that night Lily feebly called for a drink; after that she failed to call,
								inasmuch as the stomach was not full of undigested food to cause a feverish condition.
							</p>
							<!-- p 158 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Great change in five days
							</p>
							<p>
								In five days Lily stopped rolling in the dirt. Instead of dirtying five frocks,
								she soiled but one, and that not very badly. Instead of sleeping in the afternoon,
								she was wide-awake; the pig look left her eyes, they became bright; the fulness
								of her chops began to disappear. Up to this time it had been impossible for her
								to control her bladder. One spanking settled that. In a week Lily was an entirely
								different girl, and a very pretty child. At the end of the second week, when the
								mother returned, her first remark was, "My goodness, how beautiful and nice Lily
								is looking." But in two or three days the mother went back to the old regimen &ndash;
								Lily must not be starved, and I suppose by this time she is a big hog.
							</p>
							<p>
								To look at the mother, the scientists&nbsp;(?) would say it was inherited from her. No;
								it was her mother's ways &ndash; the environment. The environment given the child by her
								mother was her inheritance.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Wallow in the dirt
							</p>
							<p>
								Why did Lily wallow in the dirt? Because she had learned that the irritation caused
								by rubbing her abdomen against some object would relieve the congestion; that the
								cool earth relieved the feverish congested condition of her abdomen, which came
								from overloading her stomach.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Loved to be spanked
							</p>
							<p>
								Lily loved to be spanked. Why? Because the spanking drew the blood from the congested
								parts and was a relief, and she always felt better after this operation. The same
								congested condition was the cause of her not being able to control her bladder action.
								When the congestion was removed, the child could do as others. Therefore, the child
								being in the condition that she must be in now, it is plain to see she inherited
								nothing but an environment which was possible in the early-stages to correct.
							</p>
							<!-- p 159 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Degenerate children
							</p>
							<p>
								If the child is a degenerate, a criminal, it should not be punished. It is doing
								only what its environment forced upon it. Many children enjoy being punished. Why?
								For the same reason that Lily enjoyed it. Many children have no fear of a whipping,
								simply because the nerve-ends of feeling are so dulled that they fail to receive
								the effect usually produced. Those children should be sent to a surgeon, who generally
								can remove the cause. Their food should be changed. I know of a case of a very estimable
								lady who had two of the handsomest and sweetest little children I had ever seen.
								She came to me and said, "Mr. Santanelli, I have two beautiful children, but they
								are the two meanest young ones in the city, they are quarreling with everybody;
								they are vicious. I have whipped them, I have punished them in every manner, but
								I cannot cure them. What can I do with them? Can they be cured?"
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Animals
							</p>
							<p>
								"Yes, madam; it is very easy. You simply have two little animals. What do you feed
								them?"
							</p>
							<p>
								"Oh, in the morning we have a little ham and eggs, bacon or a little steak, at noon
								a little cold meat of some kind, and at dinner hot meat of some kind."
							</p>
							<!-- p 160 -->
							<p>
								"And you wonder that your children are as they are? What can you expect. You are
								feeding them on flesh. Their bodies are one mass of concentrated energy. Their digestive
								organs are all worried, irritated and overtaxed; they are in a naturally vicious
								mood. Take meat from their bill of fare, particularly the pork, and you will find
								you have no trouble with your children."
							</p>
							<p>
								The mother did so, and some three months afterwards wrote to me that the change
								was marvelous; the children were what she hoped them to be.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Hunger
							</p>
							<p>
								Dear reader, were you ever hungry? Do you know what hunger is? As everything is
								a combination of attributes, what are the attributes of hunger? Hunger, as we know
								it, is entirely artificial. A child is born and put to the breast, and the "good"
								mother does her best to force the child to fill itself; in a short time the child
								learns never to release the breast until its little abdomen is distended, and soon
								associates the feeling of distention as one of the attributes necessary before the
								cessation of filling up. As the child progresses, it learns or associates the ideas
								as to eating at certain hours; being in an uncomfortable (not comfortable now) but
								an "abnormal" condition, to always eat until its clothes are too tight, until it
								has a distention about the stomach; when these conditions are present it is not
								hungry, at all other times it is&nbsp;(?).
							</p>
							<p>
								If you think a minute, you would conceive that what <em>we</em> call hunger is false &ndash; acquired;
								few of us have ever experienced real hunger. I believe that real hunger is only
								when the digestive apparatus is forced by the mind to manifest an action with which
								we are unfamiliar, and even that action, or the necessity of the action is mostly
								acquired, learned of the different foods, the kinds of foods, the temperature of
								the food, and builds up an artificial or false memory condition.
							</p>
							<!-- p 161 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								All is acquired
							</p>
							<p>
								Everything man does after birth, other than the AH is replacing of his body, is
								acquired. Any action connected with the cerebro-spinal system is acquired and responsive
								to present environment (suggestion). It can be trained in any way, provided we know
								what environment to place around it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Theoretically, a healthy man should digest one hundred per cent of all food taken
								into the stomach, and the quantity of such food should be at most one-tenth of the
								amount he now consumes. He can be taught to live on anything. His digestive apparatus,
								if taken in time, can be taught, within a certain limit, to be satisfied and to
								properly take care of himself by any simple combination.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Sleep false&nbsp;(?)
							</p>
							<p>
								Speaking of the acquisition of habits, sleep is nearly all false and acquired; aside
								from the inactivity of the "mind," sleep is greatly false. A babe falls out of bed,
								man does not, provided he is sober. Some require a soft bed, some a hard one, some
								need a high pillow. A monkey must learn to wrap his tail around the branch of a
								tree, the chicken to hold on to the roost with its feet. How much of man is inherent?
								I think nothing other than the building of his body.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Try to comprehend this story
							</p>
							<!-- p. 162 -->
							<p>
								Some three years ago in Cleveland, Ohio, I placed an advertisement in the morning
								papers asking for the services of a young lady to travel with me and assist in hypnotizing,
								receiving some two hundred answers.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								The face tells
							</p>
							<p>
								Knowing well my nerve-ends, and being able to read the physical conditions, thereby
								the mental conditions, of a woman, by the "reflexes" in her face, I chose one, refusing
								several whom I had much rather have engaged, but whose faces told me that their
								troubles were such that, in the ordinary experience of mankind, they had responded
								to their deplorable suggestions, therefore, were not such as I desired. The face
								of the young lady whom I engaged plainly indicated her purity, inasmuch as I deduced
								from it that her purity, physically at least, had to be. I hired this young lady
								on the condition that the first time I desired her to go on the surgeon's table
								for an operation she would do so, telling her her troubles. The girl's eyes opened
								in astonishment, and she asked if I could look into people, wondering how it was
								possible for me to state the condition of her health, as I had, without asking her
								questions.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								A real doctor
							</p>
							<p>
								Note here, dear reader, that I am different from a doctor. When you go to the doctor,
								you tell him what is the matter with you, and then he prescribes. It strikes me
								that a real doctor could tell you what is the matter with you.
							</p>
							<!-- p 163 -->
							<p>
								Now, my troubles began. The girl's mother undertook to blackmail me; then the girl's
								father; then her brother; and then the newspapers of Cleveland were full of stories
								about Santanelli hypnotizing and stealing away a young lady. The would-be professional
								men who were hypnotists&nbsp;(?) had an excellent opportunity of telling the newspaper
								reporters what they didn't know about hypnosis, what was possible, and what was
								not possible; but I, being a good&nbsp;(?) showman, did not object to all this valuable
								advertising, and found a good many of my friends ready to assure the young lady
								that it was a terrible thing; that, now she was in my power, there was no telling
								what I would do with her. For some strange reason, probably because the young lady
								was possessed of what is usually called "common sense," failed to accept their advice,
								and after they had locked her up in the Home of the Good Shepherd and her good minister
								refused to extend a helping hand, I sent word to her to promise anything demanded,
								which she did, and was taken "home"; on that night she jumped out of a second-story
								window and disappeared.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Perversion
							</p>
							<p>
								The young lady joined me and soon became an adept as a hypnotist, and to me an exceptionally
								interesting study. She had graduated from one of the best seminaries in Ohio, was
								full of alleged learning, and hated above all things "love" poetry and married men
								(to her women that had more than two children were beasts), in her opinion, the
								most disgusting thing in the world was kissing, and she failed to understand how
								people could tolerate pets. If you will note, she objected to, or was positive against,
								anything that had at the root of it connubial love (sexuality). Ask her why she
								disliked these things and she could give no comprehensive answer. It was only after
								six weeks' study that I discovered the key-note to be a perverted love nature. Now,
								dear reader, remember a perversion is not always bad, it is other than the accepted
								"normal."
							</p>
							<!-- p 164 -->
							<p>
								In Kentucky, I placed this young lady on the surgeon's table and she was operated
								upon, my diagnosis being pronounced perfect by the surgeon, who, when I made it
								known to him, laughed at me, stating that I was some kind of a fool. After he had
								made a physical examination, he wondered greatly at my ability to "look into" people, as he called it. The most important trouble was an undeveloped uterus, which
								was properly curetted. I might note here that the young lady, although not being
								hypnotized, was, in the first quarter of a minute after the chloroform cup was placed
								over her face, completely unconscious; that several times during the operation when
								I remarked to the surgeon who was giving the anesthetic, to "crowd it, and she would
								do so and so," the moment that the cup was replaced she immediately responded. At
								the completion of the operation she was laid on the bed, and I remarked that in
								one minute she would be herself, and in that time she was. Here is a case of "suggestion,"
								pure and simple. I had never attempted to hypnotize this young lady, inasmuch as
								I was ever expecting to again be the object of an attempt at blackmail.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								This girl was not anesthetized by the chloroform; the suggestion of the chloroform
								emphasized by her perfect confidence in me, knowing the result desired and being
								of an intelligence capable to respond, took on the entire condition at the <em>suggestion
									of the chloroform.</em>
							</p>
							<!-- p. 165 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								A quick change
							</p>
							<p>
								One hour after the operation my wife told her that, as she was now comfortable,
								she &ndash; my wife &ndash; would go down and have supper, and the young lady turned to her,
								saying, "Mrs. Santanelli, will you kiss me before you go?" My wife dropped the glass
								that was in her hand and remarked, "Why, you don't want me to kiss you?" And the
								young lady said, "Yes." Later the same night, she turned to my wife and said, "Mrs.
								Santanelli, do you know, I believe I did not mean all I said when I laughed at you
								for caring so much for your little dog that died."
							</p>
							<p>
								Lady visitors came, and the young lady seemed much hurt if they did not kiss her
								on departing.
							</p>
							<p>
								The girl made a quick recovery, traveled with me for several months, during which
								time her entire nature and disposition changed. Those things that she had so disliked
								were now reasonably liked. At one time I was a bit frightened, being fearful that
								perhaps I had stirred up irritations that would result in a much more detrimental
								manner than had been the ones removed, but I can say that the good expected was
								accomplished.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Positive against to positive for
							</p>
							<p>
								The <em>sudden</em> change was brought about through the inflamed and now counter-irritated
								parts that previously had produced the positive against, and now were forcing thought
								positive for. If her mental state and its explanation to you is comprehensible,
								you can readily understand how it is possible for me to state that in many cases
								of insanity, perversions, et cetera, I can positively name the lesion or cause,
								and it is always orificial &ndash; excepting injury to the brain centers.
							</p>
							<!-- p 166 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								No mental diseases
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Insanity is a physical disease, there are no mental diseases.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								So-called mental diseases are the result of a physical disease, and the disease,
								per se, is not mental. Many of the so-called insane cases of mothers are the result
								of scars in the cervix. I have had examinations made where surgeon after surgeon
								had denied the existence of a scar, I still insisting, and in the end found a surgeon
								capable of discovering that which I persistently maintained; after removal, complete
								mental recovery has always followed.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Fear, et cetera
							</p>
							<p>
								I have never known of a case with a fear of dying, a feeling that everyone hates
								one, that one has no friends, sometimes going to extremes as to "spirits," &ndash; seeing
								and hearing them, et cetera, &ndash; where there was not a scar in the cervix, always
								the result of improper delivery.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Loss of memory
							</p>
							<p>
								Loss of memory, where there is no lesion in the head, will always be found the result
								of an enlarged or shrunken prostate. The prostate gland in man may be compared as
								to its reflexes with the uterus in women. Loss of memory in old age among men is
								always accompanied by, or the result of, an "abnormal" prostate. Remember, reader,
								every nerve has two ends; at one end is cause (suggestion), at the other is result
								(response).
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Negro problem
							</p>
							<p>
								The negro problem of the South could readily be adjusted by enforcing the law of
								Moses. The negro's body is built of sow-belly &ndash; his brain like-wise. Give him proper
								orificial treatment, thus removing the suggestion of sensuality, and your negro
								will be a harmless, valuable citizen.
							</p>
							<!-- p 167 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Not free agents
							</p>
							<p>
								They are burned for rape, yet that fails to lessen the number of assaults. If burning
								fails to stop it, surely "mind" has nothing to do with the act. The history of rape
								cases is that the ones assaulted are, as a rule, children, old women and those whom
								a "normally" passionate man would fail to be attracted to, proving that this so-called
								reason is lacking when the assault occurs. Hence, I again affirm that we are not
								free agents, we are ruled by our environment; our bodies are our closest environment;
								crime and insanity are physical diseases.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Pasteur and "bugs"
							</p>
							<p>
								In France they have erected monuments to one Pasteur, a discoverer of bugs, who
								claimed that by "shooting" more bugs into us, he could prevent a disease that man
								never has experienced.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Hydrophobia
							</p>
							<p>
								Hydrophobia in man is purely a suggested disease, none of the symptoms being like
								those of a dog suffering from rabies. There are several cases on record which have
								been cured by personal suggestion, and it is strange to me that a child of ten being
								bitten by a dog, should not develop rabies until reaching the age of forty or forty-five.
								That bug must have been an extremely slow worker or propagator of a following. Statistics
								show that "hydrophobia" in man increased seven-fold after Pasteur's discovery&nbsp;(?)
								was made known to the world. Many doctors in America have written to the authorities
								and begged that the establishment of Pasteur institutes be prohibited on this account.
							</p>
							<!-- p 168 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Instinct
							</p>
							<p>
								The scientific world claims that animals do not reason, they have instinct. All
								my animals have demonstrated beyond any question they can reason (transform sense-impression
								into action).
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								"Miss Donk"
							</p>
							<p>
								I owned a donkey last year, and like all good donkeys, she was "strong-minded."
								We desired to teach her to go up stairs. When the wise&nbsp;(?) persons of the company
								gathered around with whips and clubs, I asked what that was for, and they replied,
								"That is the only way you can make a donkey do anything." After thinking it over
								for a few minutes, I realized that most donkeys looked as intelligent as at least
								forty per cent of mankind, and nightly I was able to cause them to do many things
								through what I call the Law of Suggestion, so it might be possible to make Miss
								Donkey comprehend. I will not bother with details, but in seven minutes Miss Donkey
								climbed the stairs, and then she climbed down. Next time she went up with practically
								no urging, and I find, through my little experience with four-legged donkeys, that
								if the teacher possesses equal intelligence to the donkey, it can be made to comprehend.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								As to dogs
							</p>
							<p>
								On Christmas, a few years ago, I gave my wife a little dog, a puppy, saying to her,
								"Keep this dog in the room. I am anxious to discover what he has inherited. I believe
								that he acquires most of his actions, hence will either have to imitate us or work
								a way out himself."
							</p>
							<p>
								At the end of two years, this dog, which was a thoroughbred black-and-tan, lacked
								all of the dominant actions of an ordinary dog. His first mouse was a surprise,
								the first rat scared him. He developed into a clever ratter. Why? The dog had inherited,
								physically, a big bunch of muscles at the back of his neck, and early learned that
								the exercising of them was pleasing. His greatest pleasure was to be "ragged" &ndash;
								to play in a manner to exercise his neck. After he was taught that killing mice
								put those muscles in action, he liked to kill mice, not as cruel man does, for the
								pleasure of killing, but to respond to a suggestion forced by the construction of
								his neck.
							</p>
							<!-- p 169 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Comprehensive
							</p>
							<p>
								The mistake the investigating world makes is in overlooking the fact that man can
								comprehend nothing that he has not experienced. All that he can do is to compare
								("think"), and as his ability to receive sense-impressions is entirely different,
								either as to acuteness or dullness, from lower&nbsp;(?) animals, he is in no position
								to more than guess, and it will be a poor guess at that. The atmosphere is full
								of sounds he never hears. Musical notes make from sixteen and one-half to four thousand two hundred and twenty-four vibrations each second; when the vibrations are
								greater or less he fails to comprehend them. All forms of life differ as to the
								amount of vibration they will respond to, this graduation being necessary to keep
								up the constant transformation of energy (life). This energy is constantly being
								"passed along." When there is a deficiency, epidemic or plague appears.
							</p>

								A bishop
							</p>
							<p>
								A few winters ago in a city in Texas, I met a bishop, and oh ! he was a bishop so
								different from any minister I had ever met. He was in a promising field, for in
								this city they attempted to murder me because I was a hypnotist.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the conclusion of my first evening's performance, I went into the railroad eating
								house to get a cup of coffee. Four men were seated a few chairs to my left, and
								through every method possible other than using physical force, they tried to induce
								a quarrel. Being naturally quick-tempered, and thinking over the matter later, I
								wondered what it was that caused me to refrain from beating some of them with my
								cane. After finishing my cup of coffee, I started to leave the saloon, when I was
								met by a number of the reputable citizens, who exclaimed, the moment they saw me,
								"Thank God! you are alive." In answer to my inquiries as to what they meant, they
								hurried me over to the hotel and told me that the four men who had been passing
								all kinds of comments while I was drinking my coffee, intended to get me into a
								quarrel and kill me.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Instinct?
							</p>
							<!-- p 171 -->
							<p>
								What was it that kept me from accepting their challenge? No. Luck? Instinct&nbsp;(?)
								No. The all-wise hand (law) of Providence? Yes. Man's thoughts are forced, not chosen.
								A thought is action. What was there about them that forced the action of keeping
								quiet on my part? It was the tone in their voices that was positive against my interfering;
								it aroused in me an unconscious action of reserve. This I will better explain by
								relating the following oft-occurring incident:
							</p>
							<p>
								We read in the newspapers of an engineer having felt that a certain bridge was unsafe
								and, on reaching it, stopping his train, finding, upon investigation, that the bridge
								had been washed away, he claiming to know of no reason for his surmise except that
								when he was within five miles of the bridge, a peculiar nervousness took possession
								of him, which very rapidly developed into a feeling that the bridge was insecure.
								The explanation is very simple. From long association and habit, a locomotive engineer
								unconsciously realizes (as a hypnotized subject) the peculiar sound caused by the
								train passing over the rails when everything is in perfect order; the break in the
								bridge causing a sound different from the one he was accustomed to hear.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Rhythm
							</p>
							<p>
								This unconscious noting of the change naturally "suggested" something out of order
								with the track, and as the bridge was a very pronounced idea in the engineer's mind,
								it is the first thing that the disturbance of the rhythm would "suggest."
							</p>
							<!-- p 172 -->
							<p>
								To revert to the bishop: He was a small man, smoothly shaven, and one who did not
								hesitate to visit saloons and other places that ministers are supposed to refrain
								from. When he came into the parish, it was extremely poor; in fact, it did not seem
								possible, with such a poor parish, such a small following and in such a wild town,
								that any headway could be gained. Notwithstanding this, when I met him he had been
								there about a year, and had already succeeded in accomplishing more than many ministers
								with wealthy congregations had been able to do in ten years. He preached practical
								sermons; or, in other words, showed them how to be better men, and omitted telling
								them twice on Sunday how they were bound to be burned in hell-fire.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Comprehensiveness
							</p>
							<p>
								His sermons were interesting, comprehensive, and always had a moral which it was
								unnecessary for him to elaborate, but which his hearers could naturally deduce.
							</p>
							<p>
								When he took charge of this fold he began requesting and inviting the young men
								who were loafing on the street corners and in the saloons to come down and hear
								him preach, and naturally they refused. After succeeding in inducing a few to hear
								him, the young men, the boys, became interested, and as he preached for their benefit,
								but in an unobtrusive, comprehensive manner, they liked to listen to him. When they
								came to church they were met with a royal welcome and a smile, and when he bade
								them good-night there was a pleasant, manly look on his face, and he was not constantly
								hammering at them "the good of their souls."
							</p>
							<!-- p 173 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								A little party
							</p>
							<p>
								One evening he had a number of young ladies of his congregation meet at a residence
								and suggested to them that they give a little party, a little candy-pull which they
								thought would be "real nice," and then he named the young men who should be invited;
								the young ladies thought that was "horrid." He told each young lady whom she must
								stop on the street, when and where, to invite to attend the party. The young ladies
								at first objected, but he carried his point and something like the following took
								place:
							</p>
							<p>
								Bill Jones came from the machine shop on the way to the saloon to get a drink before
								going home to supper. Miss Brown stepped up and said, "How do you do, Will? We are
								going to have a party down at Miss Smith's next Thursday evening, and we would like
								you to attend." Bill was dumbfounded. He didn't know what to say; in fact, he said
								nothing. The young lady went on and in a couple of minutes, apparently by accident,
								the minister appeared and said, "How do you do, Bill? What's the matter, you look
								kind of broke up?"
							</p>
							<div class="tight">
								<p>
									"Well, what do you think? Miss Brown just invited me up to a party at Miss Smith's
									house, what do you think of that?"
								</p>
								<p>
									The minister said, "You're going, are you not?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"No, I guess I ain't going."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Would you like to go?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"You bet."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Well, why don't you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"I can't go in these duds."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Ah! Is that the best suit you've got?"
								</p>
								<!-- p 174 -->
								<p>
									"Well, pretty near."
								</p>
								<p>
									"You are making good money in the machine shop are you not?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes."
								</p>
								<p>
									"What do you do with your money?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Well, I have to pay my board, and after I do that and pay the saloon keeper, I
									ain't got anything left."
								</p>
								<p>
									"So that is the reason that keeps you from attending the party?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Well, you get paid next Saturday night, don't you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes."
								</p>
								<p>
									"If you had a new suit you would go? "
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Why don't you go and get a suit?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Why, I haven't money enough."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Won't the merchant trust you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"No; the only man that trusts me is the saloon man, and he won't trust me for much."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Now, Bill," the minister said, "if you would like to go, I will fix it so that
									you can get a suit "
								</p>
								<p>
									"How?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"If you will promise me you will pay so much every week until the suit is paid for,
									I will go on your bond down here at the clothing store."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Will you?" says Bill.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes," replied the preacher.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								And the preacher took him over to a member of his congregation who owned a clothing
								store, and said to the merchant, "I will go good for a suit for Bill." Bill went
								home to supper, forgetting to take a drink, and was pleased to think he was going
								to Miss Smith's party.
							</p>
							<!-- p 175 -->
							<p>
								On Saturday night, Bill, with his week's wages in his pocket, from force of habit,
								started for the saloon, but on the way there, for some reason or other, met the
								minister, who said, "How do you do, Bill?" and Bill said, "How do you do?"
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								A suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								The minister went right on, not asking Bill if he was going to pay for the suit,
								or anything else. He went around the corner and watched Bill go directly into the
								clothing store and make a payment on his account.
							</p>
							<p>
								My friend, the bishop, did this with some fifteen or eighteen young men whom he
								had picked out; he attended the party, which was very successful, standing around
								to see that the young ladies entertained their guests properly; and behold, on the
								next Sunday all of these young men were at church, and the preacher still refrained
								from telling them of hell-fire, but preached a common-sense sermon that was comprehensive
								to them, of how man could progress through the world.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Negative is positive against
							</p>
							<p>
								The saloon men began to object, the money that they were in the habit of getting
								was now being given to the merchants, and the more they objected &ndash; as a negative
								is always an affirmation against &ndash; it caused the young men to "think."
							</p>
							<p>
								As they had no place to congregate other than the street corners or the saloon,
								the minister went to the members of his congregation, whose trade had now picked
								up through the divergence of the weekly salaries that had been going to the saloon-keeper,
								and demanded of them that they pay the rental of a little house which was then empty;
								that they pay for the subscription to a certain number of magazines.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								A club
							</p>
							<p>
								The minister and some of the members of his congregation fitted up a set of club
								rooms in this house and invited the young men there, but the boys were a little
								loath at first to attend, expecting to hear nothing but preaching.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Their way
							</p>
							<p>
								Instead of that, they met a jolly good fellow in the minister, and the evenings
								were spent their way, with the exception of swearing and gambling, the young men
								learning after a few weeks that it was possible to have a minister around and still
								have a good time.
							</p>
							<p>
								As winter progressed, a club was formed, the dues made very light, the money being
								handled by the minister, and the club in a short time became self-supporting.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Practical personal suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								As the minister's congregation grew larger, the merchants profited, the young men
								began to appreciate that they profited, and through practical suggestion, he had
								succeeded in building up a congregation out of material which a majority of our
								ministers would have considered hopeless. He did not tell them what to do, but surrounded
								them with an environment which forced them to do what he knew such environment would.
							</p>
							<p>
								A lady in New York City, after taking a lesson from me, said, "Now, I have learned

								&ndash; that is, registered &ndash; while the patient is in his 'normal' condition."

								<p>
									On the stage are several bright lads; they smoke cigarettes. One comes to me and
									says, "Mr. Santanelli, will you cure me of smoking cigarettes?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Certainly," I reply, and in four or five days he is cured.
								</p>
								<p>
									The mother of another comes to me and says, "Mr. Santanelli, will you cure of smoking

								</p>
								<p>
									"Does he wish to be cured, madam?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"No."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Then I cannot cure him."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								How is this, reader? It is impossible to bring out of the mind what is not there.
								The first lad, desirous of being cured, has the thought there to be put in action.
								I induce hypnosis and say to him, "After you open your eyes, every time you think
								of smoking a cigarette, a nasty taste will come into your mouth; and every time

							<p>
								Now, the moment the lad thinks of a cigarette the nasty taste aroused causes him
								to think, "Mr. Santanelli's inspiration is working." If he puts a cigarette in his
								mouth and vomits, he says, "Good, Mr. Santanelli has succeeded both with the nasty
								taste and the vomiting." But the boy who does not want to be cured of the habit
								thinks of the cigarette and the nasty taste comes in his mouth and he says, "I will
								fool Mr. Santanelli, I will be able to smoke soon," and then he puts the cigarette
								in his mouth and if he does throw up, he says, "Well, never mind, by and by I will
								fool Mr. Santanelli;" and in an hour or so he again thinks of it and smokes one;
								the result is that my inspiration has aroused and forced into action the positive
								against me, and I have only succeeded in effecting a temporary substitution.
							</p>
							<p>
								A good minister once came to me and said, "Mr. Santanelli, many members of my congregation are hard drinkers, and I have preached and preached and preached to them of
								the sin of drinking, yet they drink just the same. What other suggestion&nbsp;(?) can
								I give them? What can I do for them?"
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Comprehensive thoughts
							</p>
							<p>
								I replied, "My good father, you make two mistakes. First, your sermons are such
								as fail to arouse comprehensive thoughts in the minds of your hearers; secondly,
								you try to put in through one sense (hearing) that which the economy of man intended
								to be received through another. Thoughts not in existence cannot be brought out.
								You fail to put into the "minds" of your hearers the thought of the ill of drinking.
								No thought can be formed through affecting less than two senses, and it requires
								three to obtain an effective result. Now, you quote me Pat Murphy, and say Pat has
								taken the pledge and you have lectured and lectured to him, yet he continues to
								drink.
							</p>
							<!-- p 179 -->
							<p>
								If I were you, and desired to cure Pat Murphy, I would do as follows: I would meet
								Pat Murphy some evening after work, talk with him pleasantly and walk or drive by
								Mike O'Hara's house. Mike works along with Pat. I would pass comments as to Mike
								having his house paid for; of the neatness of the yard; as to the appearance of
								his children. In fact, I would cause Pat to see the condition of Mike's house.
							</p>
							<p>
								I would then enter Pat's home, ask him what rental he was paying; if the landlord
								would not fix the house up if he was asked; ask Mrs. Pat what cloth for the dressing
								of her children was worth a yard. I should then say something about Pat getting
								the same wages as Mike, and there would be no need of saying anything whatever about
								drinking, as every question asked would arouse a positive against it, in pictures
								of Mike's prosperous condition, resulting from abstaining from drink; and I will
								promise you that the next time Pat went into a saloon there would be a picture aroused
								in his mind which would cause him to bring home a little of his money; or, in other
								words, by putting them in through the proper senses, I would have established a
								series of ideas positive against drinking, and the suggestion that formerly aroused
								the thought of drinking, would with a little careful nursing, be forced to respond
								positive against it."

								If a man should meet an Indian who had seen nothing of civilization, how could he
								describe to him comprehensively the strength and power of a locomotive? It would
								be necessary to associate an idea common to the Indian with an idea common to
								the locomotive, thus: as the Indian is thoroughly familiar with the horse and its
								strength, associate in that Indian's mind an idea that the pale-face had a horse
								twenty times larger than his, a thousand times stronger; that it ate coal; that
								breath came in clouds from its nostrils; that it traveled in a carefully arranged
								pathway, that it drew twenty large tepees, and although you would not have formed
								in the Indian's mind a correct picture of a locomotive, he would have a conception
								of a locomotive's power and strength.
							</p>
							<!-- p 180 -->
							<p>
								A drawing made of a locomotive would produce an impression through the eye, which,
								with the Indian's comprehension of its power and strength (association of ideas),
								would enable the Indian, when he first saw a locomotive, to deduce what it was.
								First, by its form, or the "suggestion" produced by seeing the escape of steam and
								smoke, or the drawing of the cars. Or, if he had never seen the form, seeing it
								move on the pathway or track would suggest to the Indian the story of the big horse
								as told by the pale-face. Note that two senses, feeling and sight, have been affected.

								Doctors
							</p>
							<p>
								In Tennessee, a couple of winters ago, I met the doctors of a city, who, being good,
								true Southern gentlemen, proved themselves to be good fellows. They all laughed
								about one doctor in the city, a man who knew nothing of "bugology," who had one
								of the largest practices, in fact, the largest practice in the city, tired out two
								horses every day, owned a great deal of property, and was a very busy man.
							</p>
							<p>
								After making a number of inquiries concerning this man, I concluded I would like
								to meet him and asked one of his friends to take me over and introduce me. I went
								over in the afternoon; the doctor had just finished with a little surgical case
								and was washing his hands. He was over six feet tall, had on a suit of clothes that
								was made for somebody; or, if they had been made for him, he had changed his shape;
								the material was of the best, but the fit was quite English.
							</p>
							<!-- p 181 -->
							<p>
								Upon being introduced, the doctor looked at my feet, my legs, my abdomen, my chest,
								my face, put out his hand and said "Hello, Santanelli, I like you," and asked me
								to go out to his home and take dinner. I informed the doctor that I could not, that
								I was too busy, but would dine with him some other time. He said he would be glad
								to have me, and I left.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was in the city several weeks, becoming quite friendly with the doctor, being
								in his office one day when a lady came in with a little boy, the lady badly frightened,
								the lad likewise. The boy had been bitten by a dog and the mother had heard of Pasteur
								and his wonderful discovery (which he failed to make), and was afraid the boy was
								going to shun water, foam at the mouth and do a lot of very disagreeable things
								that dogs are popularly supposed to do and men do not, and asked the doctor to "do
								something," which he did, and the little boy was awfully scared and cried. He sent
								the boy home all wrapped up, smelling very strongly of iodoform. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodoform">[Wikipedia]</a></sup>
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Hydrophobia
							</p>
							<p>
								I turned to the doctor and said, "Doctor, what do you think of hydrophobia?"
							</p>
							<p>
								He replied, "I think it's all rot, but they wanted something done, and I did it."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Why," said I, "I have a better cure than yours for hydrophobia." He wanted to know
								what it was, and I told him if any of my children (provided I had any) should claim
								they had been bitten by a dog, I would take them across my knee and spank them.
							</p>
							<!-- p 182 -->

							<p class="sidenote">
								Practical suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								"Why would you do that?" he asked. "I am one of those foolish people who
								believe suggestion. A little boy is bitten by a dog he tells his
								mother what has happened and the look on her face forces on him the thought that
								something awful has happened, perhaps to himself; he feels nothing but a little
								smarting, and his mother goes to the doctor; she is frightened all the time, tells
								the neighbors about it and they become frightened and the little boy is more scared;
								when he gets to the doctor's office and watches him treat the wound, he is still
								more scared, and when it is all bandaged up he is most scared; he has about him
								the odor of iodoform and it is constantly reminding him that he has been bitten
								by a dog; then he has to have the wound redressed several times, and the result
								is that he does nothing but 'think, think, Think' of being bitten by the dog, and
								by and by somebody tells him what to do&ndash;to shun water and foam at the mouth and
								have hydrophobia &ndash; and seventy times out of a hundred he does so.

							<p class="sidenote">
								A lazy bug
							</p>
							<p>
								Very strange, isn't it? A child bitten by a dog when five years of age, sometimes
								dies of hydrophobia when he is fifty, but still the scientists&nbsp;(?) tell us that
								a bug did it. What a procrastinator that bug must have been."
							</p>
							<p>
								It so happened in a few days that another lady came in, with her little boy who
								had been bitten by a dog. The doctor said to the mother, "Madam, I would spank that
								young man." The mother wanted to know why, and he said, "I would spank him for fooling
								with the dog." The mother did so. The result was that the boy who had his wound
								dressed had quite a sore hand before he got through, and the boy who got the spanking,
								and hadn't been bitten on the place he was spanked, stopped thinking of being bitten
								by the dog, and failed to have an irritated wound.

								One afternoon I went riding with the doctor, and he told me that he was a farmer's
								son, that he had wanted to study medicine because he thought it was easier than
								ploughing, so went to work for a doctor, took care of his horse, studied medicine,
								went to college, and at last graduated; when he came back with his diploma he had

								that he kept them alive and got his pay; that there were lots of good young doctors
								in town, who, when they came down the street, kept doffing their hats to the germs
								they met, inasmuch as they were familiar with all, and knew each and every one by
								name; that he had his hands full caring for his patients, without being bothered
								by germs, inasmuch as he didn't know a germ when he saw one; he had heard about

								Driving with a doctor
							</p>
							<p>
								Becoming very much interested in the doctor, I asked him if he would take me out
								calling with him some afternoon, and he said he would. If you have never gone driving
								with a physician, it is an experience worth undertaking, inasmuch as the doctor
								generally drives you to the outskirts of the town and lets you hold the reins while
								he goes in and gets warm and visits his patient. The doctor gets warm, comes out
								feeling comfortable, takes the reins from you and goes on a piece; while you are
								shivering with the cold, he talks to you, visits some more patients, and, after
								you have ridden with him for an hour or two, you wish you were home.
							</p>
							<p>
								But with this doctor it was different; he drove up close to one house, and said
								to me as he was getting out of the buggy, "You don't want to go in here; they have
								got a little typhoid fever, it don't amount to much," and went in. He stopped a
								few moments then came to the door followed by some young ladies and they were all
								laughing and joking. I asked how he found the patient. "I think he is better," said
								the doctor; and he got in and drove to another place, letting me hold the reins
								again. The next place he drove to was a little cottage; when we got in front of
								it, the doctor hollered, "Whoa," to the horse (you would think he was the butcher
								or milkman), gave me the lines, went to the front door, and pulled the bell in a
								manner which led one to think he was going to pull the knob clear off, when some
								one came to the door and let him in. Pretty soon he came to the door and hollered,
								"Santanelli, tie up the horse and come in, I want to introduce you to these people."
							</p>
							<p>
								I went into the house, a nice little cottage where everything was neat and trim.
								There a young mechanic was sick abed, and his young wife, together with two nice
								little children, were in the room.
							</p>
							<!-- p 185 -->
							<p>
								The doctor said, "This is Santanelli; they say he can hypnotize. I don't know whether
								he can or not. I like him, he's a pretty good fellow. This fellow in bed here thinks
								he is sick, but I don't think so. Santanelli, are you hungry?" I said I was not.
								"Well," said the doctor, "this woman makes the best pies and cakes in the country,"

							<p>
								The doctor talked in a cheery voice; he was hungry, he looked hungry; all these

								something to eat, came back, ate it and enjoyed eating it, and the sick man received
								these suggestions. Then he started to go away, which had its effect on the sick
								man who said, "Give me something for my money," the doctor writing a prescription
								which he dropped on the floor, saying, "If you are not better, get up and go down
								and get it filled; goodnight. Come along, Santanelli." His tone was healthy and

								This last summer in Ontonagon, Michigan (and, dear reader, you would never be able

								him full of pins. That night the family physician was seated in the second row of
								seats in the theater. I brought the lad from off the stage, told him to go to sleep,
								that he had no feeling in his ear, and although he went into hypnosis, he had plenty
								of feeling in the ear, and would not take the inspiration. I awakened him; he was
								trembling all over. On the stage I told him to go into hypnosis, but he was afraid.
								After assuring him that I would not put any pins into him, he did as I requested.
								After the performance I asked him what was the matter, and he replied, "I didn't
								care about your sticking pins in me when the doctor ain't there; but," he added,
								"I am afraid of the doctor, the doctor always makes trouble."

							<p>
								"Isn't he the family physician?" I asked.

							<p>
								"Yes," he replied, "but I am afraid of the doctor."

							<p>
								Why this association of ideas so contrary to the doctor. Whose fault is it, the
								doctor's or the profession's? No. Because the grandest profession in the world is
								that of medicine&nbsp;(?). (Rather, that of healing.) He who ministers to the sick, and

							<p>
								Note. &ndash; This being true, although the Nazarene was circumcised, the cataract should
								not be removed from an eye, because "God" gave man the cataract. A child, born blind,
								deaf or dumb, should not have its senses established, because "God" has made the
								child that way. An individual God would be too busy to look after us as separate
								beings; but God is good, and what God does is perfect. If a personal God made each
								one of us, we would be in His image, each of us would bear His features, and therefore
								be perfect physically, perfect mentally; but God is the Law of Suggestion, and those
								of us who have been circumcised find that we are better than those who claim they
								should keep all that "God" gave them. If we can better the animal's physical condition,
								so then should physical condition be changed in man, as the necessity for circumcision
								is a result of the irritation of the mother, her irritated ganglion teaching the
								ganglion of the child to build redundantly.
							</p>
							<p>
								Stupid superstition is as rife to-day as it was in the alleged "dark ages."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Palmistry, telepathy, et cetera
							</p>
							<p>
								Back of what the "scientists" claim to be pure superstition, is a grain of truth.
								I believe there is some truth in palmistry, telepathy and clairvoyance, and it is
								proven that there is efficiency in fetishes, amulets, charms, et cetera, though
								I have yet to observe a case of either telepathy or clairvoyance that I considered
								a demonstration of phenomena. It is possible for one familiar with human nature
								to foretell to a reasonable extent, or predestine personal actions. If a right-handed
								man is lost in a forest and we meet him, we can tell him that he is moving in a
								circle to the left, because he will step a little further with his right foot.
							</p>
							<!-- p 204 -->
							<p>
								So-called superstitious people have a right to their superstitions; they were sick,
								procured their charm and got well. It is well-known that a patient, lacking confidence
								in his physician, receives but little benefit from his treatment (charm). When our
								non-superstitious people call on the doctor and he fails to cure them; he then berates
								their lack of superstition.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								The tale of a wart
							</p>
							<p>
								Let us follow a "superstitious" lady who desires to get rid of a wart on her finger.
								Auntie brings the washing some Saturday evening, and notes the wart on madam's finger.
								She says, "Lawd, lady, why don't you get rid o' dat wart?" and madam replies that
								she has consulted several doctors, but they cannot get the roots out; the wart always
								grows back. Auntie informs her that an old mammy she knows would charm that wart
								away; she has seen her do so lots of times; it is easy. Madam becomes interested,
								so she thinks it over and all the time she is thinking about going to mammy's cabin,
								she is holding in her "mind" the thought of getting rid of the wart. She dresses
								very plainly one afternoon, and starts for mammy's cabin, all the time nervous and
								afraid that somebody will see her and know where she is going. Therefore, she is
								thinking all the time of getting rid of that wart. Timidly knocking at the door,
								she goes in, filled with awe and fear, and notes the surroundings. After talking
								with her, mammy has her sit down, takes her hand, makes some cabalistic passes,
								telling her just exactly what she must do, and that at a certain time, exactly,
								she must do a certain thing; if she will do so for a certain length of time, the
								wart will surely disappear.
							</p>
							<!-- p 205 -->
							<p>
								The woman, after watching mammy's work and manipulations, returns home, still afraid
								of being observed by her neighbors, and at last sits down with a sigh of relief,
								thankful that the ordeal is over, not realizing that for the past two hours her
								mind has been set on getting rid of the wart. Now her curiosity is aroused; will
								the wart disappear?
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Will it disappear?
							</p>
							<p>
								Every time she feels the wart, it arouses in her "mind" the thought of its disappearance;
								and every little while she goes to the light to see if the wart has really vanished.
								In time it does.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								"It shore will"
							</p>
							<p>
								If this is not a practical case of suggestion by reaching the mind, I do not know
								what is. I fail to see the superstition, as the wart disappears by suggestion. Madam
								does not care whether it was suggestion, or what it was, she knows the wart was
								on her hand, and remembers the learned&nbsp;(?) doctor's failure, realizing that mammy
								has done what the doctor failed to do, and is happy, or, as the doctors say, she
								is now extremely superstitious. No! What you think is, what you believe is, as far
								as you are personally concerned.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Emotion
							</p>
							<p>
								Our psychologists are always talking of emotion. Emotions are extremes and the same
								nerve-ends are stimulated to produce the two opposite emotions. Sadness affects
								certain muscles of the face and forces the tear ducts to pour forth tears. Extreme
								mirth produces the same result.
							</p>
							<!-- p 206 -->
							<p>
								The myriads of deductions, as to emotion, made by our psychologists are entirely
								false. We have five ways of receiving ten extreme ideas, and to the degree of emphasis
								or stimulus (suggestion), and of the ideas already associated, do the emotions respond.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Abdominal brain
							</p>
							<p>
								I believe the Sympathetic System and the cerebro-spinal system to be of one Abdominal
								Brain. The cerebro-spinal receives the impressions and carries them to the sympathetic
								ganglion, which receives unconsciously and can perform this function free from the
								cerebro-spinal, but the cerebro-spinal can do absolutely nothing without the sympathetic.
								In other words, it is inherent with, and cannot be disassociated from the sympathetic.
							</p>
							<p>
								You see, hear, smell, feel or taste something repulsive, and immediately become
								sick at the stomach. The cerebro-spinal simply registers the memory of the sense-stimuli,
								but the nerve-ends that receive this are beyond all question sympathetic, the cerebrum
								being simply a side issue, and like the registering mechanism of a phonograph; so,
								instead of being sick through a reflex action, which I cannot comprehend, it is
								all direct.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								All action direct
							</p>
							<p>
								So-called reflex action has never been comprehensively explained to me. All action
								is direct.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Magnetism
							</p>
							<p>
								If matter is the expression of mind, so-called magnetism must be an expression in
								matter that attracts other matter. Therefore, a person possessed of a pure body
								will have a pure mind, consequently, a pure expression in his face, attracting the
								pure, and vice versa. That this is true, I have proven.
							</p>
							<!-- p 207 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								How I cleaned house
							</p>
							<p>
								There was a time in my life when pure women, children and babes were afraid of me,
								and would not look at me. I decided to "clean house," and after my surgeons had
								finished with me, acquired the thought that man partakes of the nature of the food
								he eats. I was in Kansas, where they fed us on ham and eggs or bacon and eggs for
								breakfast, roast pork for dinner, and cold ham and sausage for supper; at last I
								concluded I was a hog, and began experimenting.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Stopped liquor
							</p>
							<p>
								Desiring to cease drinking liquor, I stopped eating pork, and, strangely, the amount
								of liquor I consumed proportionately decreased. I then quit eating flesh, and in
								eight months, with no effort on my part, ceased drinking liquor.
							</p>
							<p>
								Before this, I had reached such a stage that when a gentleman invited me to his
								home I would refuse; being afraid to meet the ladies of the family. In a city in
								Arkansas I played an engagement of one week, returning after a couple of weeks,
								and had to lay off one night. That night I was invited to a children's party. I
								was afraid to go, but went after my friend insisted. The children, of course, knew
								who I was; they began talking to me and I forgot myself. For a time I was thoroughly
								unconscious of my environment, recovering to find that I was in the middle of the
								parlor on my knees with some dozen little girls around me, some with their arms
								about my neck, and the tears were rolling down my cheeks; then I realized that I
								had "cleaned house," that the brutal nature had passed away, and the "magnetism"
								with which I had been blessed as a lad, had partially returned; had returned to
								the extent that the children had seen in my face and responded to the love I now
								had for them. This is the pleasantest memory of my life.
							</p>
							<!-- p 208 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Babes no longer cried
							</p>
							<p>
								After that I used to smile and speak to the babes as I passed them on the street,
								and they always smiled in return. A year before this time, if I looked at a baby
								it was certain to cry.
							</p>
							<p>
								To further prove this thought, about a year afterward, I met a party of ladies in
								a hotel parlor, became very angry, and dismissed them. Going onto the porch of the
								hotel (this was in the South), I saw a baby in a carriage. When I spoke to the baby
								it began yelling, and would not stop until I left. Upon meeting the baby the next
								day, when I was in a good humor, it was pleased to see me, thus showing that personal
								magnetism is simply the expression in matter of mind. Therefore, the foul mind gives
								forth foul expression, which is immediately responded to by those of the same type.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								To cultivate personal magnetism
							</p>
							<p>
								To cultivate personal magnetism, cultivate purity. The orator or the actor who magnetizes&nbsp;(?) his audience is simply a person possessing much expression, and who unconsciously
								tells his story by affecting two senses. The non-magnetic man is the one who affects
								only one &ndash; the ear, &ndash; but the man who affects both the eye and the ear, who is full
								of expression and gesture, is the most magnetic always.

								Sleep in church
							</p>
							<p>
								My dear reader, you are a hypnotist, why is it that people in the front pew of a
								church, particularly if the altar be high, so readily fall asleep? Easy position,
								upturned eye, concentration, and monotony in the voice of the minister. There is
								but one way to hypnotize, and that is by bringing the proper five attributes together.
								The making of "passes" is simply using the deaf and dumb language to a person. They
								suggest through feeling what the comprehensive hypnotist suggests through the ear.
								Downward passes mean sleep, therefore every time the subject feels the downward
								passes he thinks of sleep and goes to sleep&nbsp;(?), or is in hypnosis, with the sense
								of feeling keen and acute, waiting for the upward passes. When the upward passes
								are made, he awakens, because that is associated with and forces the thought of
								awakening.
							</p>
							<p>
								A thought consists of two or more associated sense-impressions.
							</p>
							<p>
								My dear reader, you love your mother, your father, your brother, your sister and
								wife (if you have one), and children if you are so blessed. Just think of the all-wise
								provisions that the "scientific" world has made for your welfare.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Scientific teaching
							</p>
							<p>
								You or I knew a young man, a boy. We knew him playing in the street and going to
								school. His father possessed a little money and did not wish the boy to perform
								manual labor, so at eighteen or nineteen years of age he is sent to a medical college.
								Now, mind, this boy has no practical knowledge of anything. He has had no experience,
								whatever, in the world. He is a suckling, and spends four years in this college
								listening to words, watching the professors of anatomy demonstrate (feeling-sense),
								watching operations by old men, visiting the hospital and watching the doctors prescribe.
								His actual experience consists of cutting up one cadaver, perfunctorily; the proper
								dissection of one cadaver would have taken him at least four years. It would be
								necessary for him to dissect at least a dozen before he could properly become familiar
								with the structure of the human body.

								A diploma
							</p>
							<p>
								At the end of the fourth year, being still a boy, he graduates by answering a lot
								of questions &ndash; words associated with words, necessarily carrying with them no comprehension
								&ndash; and this boy, after taking the oath to be honorable, which as yet he is too young
								to comprehend, is given a parchment which entitles him to assume the treatment of
								the most vicious diseases, to reduce the most intricate dislocations, to assist
								"nature" in bringing new beings into the world; to have entree to our homes under
								all of the most delicate circumstances, and thus come into possession of the skeletons
								in our closets; to be sent for when our dearest relative is likely to pass away.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">

							</p>
							<p>
								This boy &ndash; inexperienced as to all things worldly &ndash; is entitled by law to this right.
								Is it sensible, is it just?
							</p>
							<p>
								To further strengthen this injustice, the law designates to whom {experience not
								being a factor) we shall go when we are sick; failing to do so, we shall be punished.
								All other contracts, to stand before a court of law, must be equitable; a just consideration
								must be given. What consideration do we get in return for being forced to go to
								this man with a parchment? Does he guarantee to cure us? Will he cure us? Does he
								cure us? Can he cure us? If he fails, why should we not have redress?
							</p>
							<!-- p 211 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Why this law?
							</p>
							<p>
								Again, we know of a person who is of mature Why this age, who knows life, who knows
								from experience ,aw? right from what the world calls wrong, and through the proper
								senses, how to treat disease; who is capable of handling diseases &ndash; proving his
								capability by past deeds, &ndash; and why should we not go to him? Why should he be punished
								for treating us? Why should we be punished for accepting his treatment?
							</p>
							<p>
								If the graduates, at the end of four years, were possessed of any actual knowledge,
								if they could demonstrate any other than an ocular one of displaying their diplomas,
								I would have nothing to say. I do not believe that the Supreme Court of the United
								States will sustain any such law, inasmuch as the Constitution gives us the right
								to choose whom we shall have dealings with. The wise&nbsp;(?) legislators, knowing nothing
								of medicine, and little of farming, unhesitatingly dictate to the world to whom
								the sick shall go for relief.

							</p>
							<p>
								The Nazarene <em>cured</em> by suggestion. The Christian Scientists <em>cure</em> by suggestion; the
								Mental Scientists <em>cure</em> by suggestion; the so-called Faith Curists <em>cure</em> by suggestion; the Hypnotist <em>cures</em> by suggestion, and what <em>cures</em> the physician accomplishes are by <em>suggestion</em>; but a wise medic whispers into the ear of the farmer legislator &ndash; who is another of the modern superstitions, as we believe him to be a representative man, a maker of laws for the <em>good</em> of men, &ndash; this medic whispers in his ear, "These other people do not cure."
							</p>

							</p>
							<p>
								Then who does? It is passing strange that, with all his curing, he has to force
								the people to patronize him while all the other scientists fall under the ban of
								the law.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this country of alleged freedom, let the curists fight their own battles, let
								them live by the deeds they do. In all other affairs that is the law, but a man's
								life is so dear to the legislators &ndash; who are always standing around the lobbies
								with their hands behind them &ndash; that they cannot allow man to care for his own life,
								it is not precious enough to him; he is not capable of "choosing" to whom he shall
								go; he must be saved from himself; he must go to a man with a parchment and have
								that man pour a serum &ndash; the putrefaction of disease of horses, cows, dogs, goats
								and rabbits into his blood, to kill a poor little bug.

								Now, dear reader, I am not railing at the doctors personally, but at their pseudo
