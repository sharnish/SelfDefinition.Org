								Frauds&nbsp;(?)
							</p>
							<p>
								The alleged fraudulent hypnotists are simply fools who do not know how to convince
								their audiences or handle their subjects. Subjects cannot "fake." When you credit
								the hypnotist with being able to teach the element that goes on the stage to act
								their parts, you credit both with having more intelligence than ourbest stage managers
								and actors, and my experience teaches me that their faces would instantly deny any
								such credence.
							</p>
							<!-- p 69 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Authority
							</p>
							<p>
								One "authority," in Chicago, concludes his work by doubting hypnosis. Quotations
								from him show his lack of knowledge of the Law of Suggestion. The following example
								was the one that shook his faith most: The subject was lying in hypnosis on an operating
								table, and several spectators were challenged to awaken him. They tried many ways
								and failed, then asked if they might spit in the subject's face. The "authority"
								said, "Yes, you may spit in his face if you wish." They did so, and the subject
								immediately awakened, thus satisfying the "authority" that the subject had not been
								in hypnosis. Dear reader, need I explain this? If so, throw the book away or go
								and give yourself to the authorities having charge of a school for imbeciles.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Two tones
							</p>
							<p>
								In the "handling" of subjects two tones should be used, one for the inspiration,
								and one to emphasize (force) minor actions.
							</p>
							<p>
								In my early days, while giving exhibitions in the South, at the conclusion of an
								entertainment a Southern gentleman came onto the stage with a friend and said, "Mr.
								Santanelli, this gentleman does not believe that young man was hypnotized. Will
								you "hypnotize" that nigger (pointing to one) and prevent him from picking up this
								one hundred dollar bill? If he picks it up, he can have it." I "hypnotized" the
								negro, put the one hundred dollar bill at his feet and told him he could not pick
								it up. The negro immediately became cataleptic, rigid, and failed to move. I wanted
								him to stoop and put his hand on the bill and attempt to pick it up, knowing that
								if he could not pick it up he must shove it to the floor, so I said "Oh, yes you
								can; go ahead, pick it up." The negro failed to respond for a moment, then bent
								over and took hold of the bill; I saw that he had responded to my last remark as
								an inspiration, so I immediately called to him that he could not move. Cold chills
								passed up my back, as I could not afford to lose one hundred dollars; and, of course,
								would not have allowed my friend to do so provided I had it. Since then I always
								use two tones, for fear of the subject mistaking or not comprehending (responding
								to) the difference in the tones, I always finish in this manner: "Go ahead, pick
								it up. Go on, <em>but you cannot.</em>"
							</p>
							<!-- p 70 of text -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								No stages
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>There arc no stages in so-called hypnosis.</em> The subject is either hypnotized
								or awake.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Catalepsy
							</p>
							<p>
								Catalepsy is not a <em>stage</em> of the hypnosis, it is simply an inspired condition.
								Any subject can be made cataleptic if he knows how to become so. The inspiration
								I give to produce catalepsy is as follows: "Put your feet together, put your hands
								to your sides. When I call 'now' you will take a long breath, pull your muscles
								together and you will be stiff, stiff as iron." It is very rarely that a subject
								fails to respond to this. Sometimes they will draw their knees and arms up, not
								knowing how to become rigid in the position I give them. Many operators tell a subject
								to hold his arm up and then that he cannot take it down, and the spectator, noting
								the tightening of his muscles when he gets the inspiration that he cannot put his
								arm down, believes the subject to be "faking."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Negations
							</p>
							<p>
								If the operator will remember that all negations are affirmations against, and would
								first put the muscles at the tension or in the position he wants them and then deny,
								there would be no such action. Tell a subject to hold his arm up and close his fist;
								the muscles are now contracted, and by telling him he cannot put it down, you are
								really saying to him to keep the muscles in the position they are in. If you wish
								to produce a condition of the muscles, first put the muscles into the desired position
								and infer that he cannot release them, because if he cannot, he must hold the position.
							</p>

								Number of methods to induce hypnosis
							</p>
							<p>
								How many ways are there of inducing hypnosis? <em>Only one.</em>
							</p>
							<div class="tight">
								<p>
									When I was in Utica last winter, on the second day of my return engagement, a lad
									called on me and said, "Mr. Santanelli, how many ways do you know how to hypnotize?"
								</p>
								<p>
									I replied, "But one, my lad."
								</p>
								<p>
									He looked surprised, saying, "Why that is strange, I know of nineteen ways."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Good for you, lad. Can you lay them out on the floor as I do?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"No, sir, that is the funny part of it; I cannot get any of them asleep. You have
									only one way; I have watched you nightly and so far you only failed to hypnotize
									two, and three-fourths of them were new ones every night. What is your way?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"The right way."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Well, can 'some' of mine be right?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"No, there is but one way, and that is the right way; that is the reason your nineteen
									ways are failures, none of them are right."
								</p>
							</div>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Hypnosis
							</p>
							<p>
								If hypnosis consists of five attributes, the shortest, quickest method of bringing
								these five together is the right way. All others are wrong. A Chicago firm publishes fifty ways, or the promise of teaching fifty ways, to induce hypnosis. That
								is in the line of modern science&nbsp;(?).
							</p>
							<p>
								"Still, Mr. Santanelli, I have hypnotized many subjects without using any of the
								attributes you name as necessary to hypnosis; how is that?"
							</p>
							<!-- p 72 of text -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Hypnosis self-induced
							</p>
							<p>
								"Very simple, my dear sir. First, you do not hypnotize; you lead another into hypnosis.
								After a subject has once been taught the way to the post-office, he can go without
								any guidance on your part.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								"Sensitives"
							</p>
							<p>
								Twenty-seven per cent of mankind are what is known as "sensitives" &ndash; somnambulists,
								sleep-walkers. Unconsciously knowing the way into hypnosis any method you use is
								satisfactory. You can tell him to go to the postoffice over the telephone, you can
								tell him every time he hears the whistle of the factory he will go to the postoffice;
								there are a hundred suggestions that may cause him to go to the postoffice. So it
								is with the sensitive, he knows the way; your method is nothing. You can only hypnotize
								&nbsp;(?) three in ten; with my method I can "hypnotize" one hundred of one hundred, provided
								they give me their attention."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Auto-suggestion
							</p>
							<p>
								Auto-suggestion can only exist in the case of a sleep-walker, proven by the fact
								that he responds to no one's voice. It is spontaneous, and is the nearest to being
								self.
							</p>

							<p class="sidenote">
								Pre-inspiration
							</p>
							<p>
								In my experience, subjects have pre-inspired themselves with the thought of leaving
								the stage, which each time was successful. The first happened in a little town in
								Tennessee. My reader must understand this, that a certain portion of my evening
								entertainments were always the same; that is, I laid the subjects on the floor,
								produced the catalepsy, built the "log-pile," then caused them to rub their ears,
								then their knees, and then take a seat on the chairs.
							</p>
							<!-- p. 73 -->
							<p>
								In the instance I have in mind, the young man, who was some twenty-two years of
								age, although not larger than a lad of twelve, came onto the stage several nights
								and proved himself to be an extremely clever subject. I think it was on the fifth
								night when he was laid on the floor, after having been used in the "log-pile," he
								immediately got up and joined his companions in the orchestra seats. I was greatly
								surprised. No comment was made, but that night after I went to the hotel I did considerable
								"thinking," and at last concluded as to how he succeeded in doing so.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was so successful in the city that I remained over and played the following week,
								and on Wednesday night this young man and his friends were again in the opera house.
								I invited him to come onto the stage. He said, "No." I asked him why, and he replied,
								"You will make it hot for me."
							</p>
							<p>
								"No, I will not. I would like you to come up and repeat the experiment." He looked
								at me a moment and said, "This is not a trick?"
							</p>
							<p>
								"No, I wish to see if you can repeat what you did last Friday. It is a matter of
								science. You have proven your side of it, and I want to see what I can do with mine."
							</p>
							<!-- p 74  -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Where pre-inspiration failed
							</p>
							<p>
								The young man came onto the stage, took on hypnosis and when I awakened him, some
								thirty minutes later, and asked him why he hadn't taken his seat, he looked puzzled,
								and said, "I don't know." I did; do you, dear reader?
							</p>
							<p>
								The form of pre-inspired thought that this young man took was this: "After I am
								laid on the floor in the unbuilding of the 'log-pile,' I will awaken." Now, mind,
								he was to awaken when he was laid on the floor out of the "log-pile." I omitted
								putting him in the "log-pile," therefore the suggestion that was to awaken him did
								not occur, hence no awakening. <em>There is no effect without a cause </em>(suggestion).
							</p>
							<p>
								Last winter, in Erie, three subjects left the stage one night during the "statuary,"
								in the latter part of the second week of my engagement. They had watched the performances
								all of the first week and had been on the stage several nights, were good subjects,
								and this night took a pre-inspiration that at the fourth inspiration given in the
								"statuary" they would awaken. They did so, left the stage, said the whole thing
								was a "fake," but failed to impress any of the audience.
							</p>
							<p>
								I immediately caused a subject to do a little more difficult act than that, and
								one I inspired, instead of the subject taking a pre-inspiration. I told the subject
								that when he opened his eyes he would find he had a couple of dice and would throw
								craps, and that at the end of three minutes he would awaken, which he did. Afterwards
								he pre-inspired himself with the thought that when he opened his eyes he would think
								of one of the most amusing incidents he ever witnessed, and at the end of a minute
								and a half would awaken. He did so, the audience holding their watches both times,
								and both times he awakened to the instant.
							</p>
							<!-- p 75 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Easy to accept a pre-inspiration
							</p>
							<p>
								Any subject, after he has been in hypnosis four or five times, should very readily
								go into that condition with a pre-inspiration of awakening upon the occurrence of
								a certain event, and if the event takes place he will awaken, demonstrating nothing
								except the subject's ability to accept a pre-inspiration.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Freaks
							</p>
							<p>
								All dime museum freaks, such as the human pin-cushions, poison eaters or snake eaters,
								work under pre-inspiration. In the course of time the merging of the "normal" into
								the pre-inspiration becomes second nature and can be very rapidly and almost imperceptibly
								done; still, an expert, understanding the "reflexes," by closely watching the subject
								can comprehend that he is not in the so-called normal condition and may note the
								change.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is this quick merging that has given many of the alleged exposers a standing
								with superficial newspaper men, who have accepted their word that they were not
								in "hypnosis" when they reproduced the work that the operator caused them to do
								on the stage.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Martyrs
							</p>
							<p>
								The martyr burning at the stake is an example of pre-inspiration, the entire environment
								forcing and maintaining in the "mind" of the subject or person the thought that
								he will not suffer and will have no pain. The snake dancing of the Mokis is done
								under "hypnosis"; also many of the endurance and religious tests of the adepts of
								the East.
							</p>
							<!-- page 76 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Length of inspiration
							</p>
							<p>
								How long will an inspiration last? The public fears, forever.
							</p>
							<p>
								My experience is that great skill is required to force a thought to remain over
								one minute with a new subject working by himself. Training them to hold a thought
								(no; training sounds "faky," develop them, sounds better) requires experience on
								the part of the operator. Lead into hypnosis a new subject, start him brushing a
								fly, if he continues for one minute you have a good subject. Put two working together,
								and you may keep them at work for two minutes. Three or more subjects working together
								will hold out for a long time. To work one subject alone is very hard. Three or
								more, easy.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								To cure a headache
							</p>
							<p>
								You desire to cure a headache, to let your patient go home. If the patient is a
								"good" subject (has been in hypnosis often), perhaps it will be an hour until he
								again feels the headache. Only a nervous headache can be "cured" through hypnosis.
								In all other cases there is no cure, simply the producing of "no feeling." Might
								just as well give the patient a dose of morphia.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Developing
							</p>
							<p>
								"But, Mr. Santanelli, I am a doctor; you have taught me of the many ills that can
								be relieved through hypnosis. My patient is free from pain, yet I wish to force
								certain changes physically. The patient has never been hypnotized and the holding
								of the thought for one minute is of no value to me. What is to be done?"
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Lengthening the period
							</p>
							<p>
								Induce hypnosis while the patient is lying on a sofa; return every five minutes
								and re-inspire by saying, "Stay deep asleep, deep asleep." Keep the patient there
								for two hours, renewing every fifteen minutes during the last hour. You can rest
								assured that when the patient leaves he will retain the thought for an hour and
								a half. After that, the time will lengthen one-third with each inspiration up to
								twenty-four hours. None will hold an inspiration over twenty-four hours, but can
								so be trained or developed that a very slight suggestion will continue the inspiration.
								I am certain that subjects making the long sleeps in the windows, are re-inspired
								by the suggestion of their environment every twenty-four hours.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Co-operation
							</p>
							<p>
								If a subject is willing to sleep but twenty-four hours, can I force him to sleep
								forty-eight? No. The thought (action) is not there to be brought out, and I cannot
								play off from the cylinder what is not on it. Therefore, the operator is always
								"in the hands" of the subject, and the work is co-operative. Any subject can seemingly
								refute or destroy the claims of any operator.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								As to teaching
							</p>
							<p>
								Writing of training or developing a subject &ndash; what can be "taught" them? Absolutely
								nothing. We say to a subject, "When you open your eyes, you're alongside a fishing
								stream; you see beside you bait, lines, hooks, et cetera, now open your eyes." If
								the subject does not possess the ideas (actions) to be forced by the "ghosts" just
								mentioned, <em>no action is possible.</em>
							</p>
							<!-- p 78 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Simulation impossible
							</p>
							<p>
								If there is no action in the subject, i. e., ideas associated, no ghost to be aroused,
								then the subject must act&nbsp;(?). His cerebrum is inactive, he is possessed of absolutely
								no ideas relative to the thought; therefore, if unconscious (cerebrum inactive),
								<em>he possesses no action,</em> he would not know what to do. "From nothing only
								nothing can be produced." Again, words mean nothing.
							</p>
							<p>
								If I put three subjects in a photograph scene; one the photographer, one the dude,
								the other the girl, they having never been in a photograph gallery, I get no action.
								I rehearse it &ndash; all right. If the words and actions of all three are not perfect
								the act will fail. Theatrical companies rehearse a play at least six weeks and are
								on the road at least two months before the performance runs smoothly. In all the
								smaller cities where hypnosis is popular, local subjects and different ones every
								night the hypnotist must have, if he expects to make a living. Assuming that in
								the photograph scene I use two of my "horses" (subjects I carry with me) and one
								local man, my subjects do not know what he will do or what he will say. My rehearsal
								would have been useless. But in hypnosis I force them to see a certain environment, and all photograph galleries are so similar that if they have ever been in
								one, the general environment that is now constantly around them will force them
								as automatic beings to an ultimate end, which would be impossible if all three did
								not see the gallery. Seeing the actual environment and each guessing what the others
								would do, would produce confusion. They all see the same general picture, therefore
								act in unison.
							</p>
							<!-- p 78 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								"Hypnotic horses"
							</p>
							<p>
								A hypnotic "horse" is simply a good subject who travels with a hypnotist, generally
								possesses a good singing voice, the ability to make stump speeches, or with a humorous
								personality. Never of any use after a year, as he gets so at home in "hypnosis"
								that the public will no longer accept him as "hypnotized." What I call a good subject
								the public will not stand for. What the public calls a good subject I have no use
								for.
							</p>
							<p>
								One season I had traveling with me a Swede named Carl, whom I used to inspire thus:
								"When you open your eyes, you will find yourself seated on the stage of the theater
								in La Crosse, Wis., to give the people a speech, as the boys have decided to run
								you for mayor, provided you tell them what you will do if elected, and your Swedish
								dialect is very pronounced." (Note that the inspiration is in one sentence, properly
								correlated connected with "ands," "buts," et cetera; no possibility of it being
								made other than one thought.) "Now open your eyes." Carl opened his eyes, made his
								bow and in the most pronounced dialect gave an illiterate, asinine speech that provoked
								roars of laughter. Carl could give but two speeches. Nightly the audience demanded
								a speech. While in Philadelphia, I had a speech written for Carl and had him learn
								it. Then I was stuck. How could I inspire him to get the speech that was written
								for him? If I said, "You will deliver the speech you learned," he would have tried;
								I did, and the effect was worse than bad. He simply did what he would have done
								had he not been hypnotized. He could not properly deliver it; it lacked personality,
								individuality and spontaneity. It was simply like a school boy, delivering, parrot-like,
								a speech of Henry Clay or Daniel Webster, and just as assinine. The only teaching
								is to allow the subject to watch many subjects in an act that sometime in the future
								you expect to put him in, that he may "absorb" some of the better actions.
							</p>
							<!-- p 80 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Professional subjects
							</p>
							<p>
								In the cow act, milking a table for a cow, I use a feather duster as the cow's tail
								to switch the milker in the face. One young man, who was very funny in the act,
								I nearly always used. After a few months, instead of watching the place for the
								cow's tail, he watched&nbsp;(?) me and dodged every time he saw the duster coming towards
								him. He quickly learned (feeling) that he was hit from behind instead of by the
								tail of the cow, and I could no longer put him in the act. Professional subjects
								last but a short time, and when discharged, often make exposes&nbsp;(?).
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Crime
							</p>
							<p>
								What makes a man steal? Does he choose to steal, or is the stealing forced upon
								him? If a man's actions are caused or forced on him by his environment, he steals
								because he responds minus to that environment. Why does he respond minus to this
								environment when others do not? Because his ideas (actions associated) are positive
								against, where the so-called normal man is positive for. If it takes ten parts to make the whole, and you possess nine, you lack the entirety.
								Therefore, the criminal steals the moment the ten parts are brought together.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Crime in hypnosis
							</p>
							<p>
								Can
								he be made to steal in hypnosis? No. Why not? First, if the nine parts only were
								brought together and one was missing, he failed to steal. After we lead him into
								hypnosis, we are unable to <em>furnish</em> the other part, saying nothing about
								knowing what attribute to furnish. How about a confirmed criminal? If we tell him
								when he opens his eyes he will go down and break into a bank, he will say, "Go break
								into it yourself. Why should I steal for you?"
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Man does nothing because he is told to.</em>
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Confirmed criminal
							</p>
							<p>
								What is a confirmed criminal? One who is a perversion, who accepts as good what
								other people believe to be wrong. I have had a great deal of experience with perversion.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								"Faking"
							</p>
							<p>
								Young men will come onto my stage, be good subjects all the week, and when I leave
								they will claim they were "faking," failing to comprehend that by claiming they
								were "faking," they make themselves out most disreputable; that, instead of doing
								something great and clever, they assisted a traveling mountebank whose business
								it was to accumulate the money of their friends, that they deliberately went on
								the stage and assisted in swindling and robbing of their money those among whom
								they live; off from whom they live; which is the lowest and most contemptible thievery
								in the world. The traveling operator is naturally accepted as a mountebank; if he
								proves so, that is what is expected of him, but for a man to be a stool-pigeon or
								decoy to rob his own people and swindle them for verv little or no compensation,
								is the lowest of crimes.

								Cannot simulate

								Any time a person tells you that he "faked" for some one else, look him in the eye

								<em>No crime has ever been committed in hypnosis.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the reason: man's thoughts (actions) are made up, organized or correlated
								only in his "normal" state; to force him to commit murder it would be necessary
								to give him all the attributes while he was "normal." The moment all the attributes
								had been associated, this man would that instant commit the murder; his not doing
								so is proof positive that some of the attributes were missing. The hypnotist, not
								being able to put anything in his "mind," would be unable to furnish the attributes
								necessary.
							</p>
							<p>
								"But, Mr. Santanelli, I have hypnotized a young fellow, a chum of mine, made him
								go to a friend's house and steal a necktie." O! no; you did not. You hypnotized
								your chum, and he, to make good an experiment, went and took the necktie. The taking
								of the necktie by your chum was not an act that would cause an arrest or conviction.
								In fact, it was not a crime in his "mind." Hypnotize your chum and tell him that
								at midnight he will go down to the bank and break open the safe, and see if he will
								do so.
							</p>

							<p class="sidenote">
								Words mean nothing
							</p>
							<p>
								Remember, words mean nothing; you tell a man to steal something, that does not necessarily
								make it out stealing. Or, you tell a man to help himself to something and that may
								be stealing.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Natural action
							</p>
							<p>
								Parlor experiments are very flimsy premises to base a philosophy on. Why, the wonderful
								&nbsp;(?) acts done by my subjects on the stage during the past few months, knowing as
								I now do the actions, attributes, et cetera, and comprehending that I am deceiving
								but one sense, sight, and cannot impress the other senses necessary, to me these
								so-called wonderful acts are disgusting. The public still wonders and is carried
								away, because it does not comprehend a natural action.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								As to taking advantage of a woman
							</p>
							<p>
								I have a lady seated alone in a room with me &ndash; in a room with the door open.
								After leading her into hypnosis, I close the door; where is this woman? She went
								into hypnosis in a room with the door open and in the presence or in the company
								of a gentleman. With the door closed and locked, there is no advantage to me, inasmuch
								as she is in the room with the door open. As she will do nothing because I tell
								her, and as the consciousness of place can be aroused very readily, if I approach
								her, attempting an assault, the environment that she was last in and the physical
								force I begin to exert will force from her the same action that would be exerted
								were she not in hypnosis; she is simply a blind woman. The other senses will respond
								"normally." There is no environment that I can arouse around her that will cause
								her to do anything that she would not do under the same environment were she not
								in hypnosis.
							</p>
							<!-- p 84 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								"No feeling" results in contraction
							</p>
							<p>
								A lady in hypnosis is on the operating table in a doctor's office submitting to
								an examination. Can the physician rape her? Now, remember, she is on the operating
								table. Her position &ndash; her sensing &ndash; holds that environment. If physical
								force is exerted she will call for help, or she will defend herself. If the physician
								tells her she has no feeling, the organs will contract, this being the action of
								the thought of "no feeling." If he tells her she is rigid &ndash; that is, cataleptic
								&ndash; there will be the same physical result. Therefore, it is impossible for
								a physician to take advantage of his patient in hypnosis.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, dear reader, as this question of taking advantage is of the greatest importance,
								as it keeps this art from being put to any practical use by the medical fraternity,
								inasmuch as husbands, fathers and brothers are afraid to allow their women to be
								hypnotized; as several persons have been sentenced to the penitentiary and many
								doctors are being blackmailed, I must illustrate and prove most conclusively that
								this thought of taking advantage is entirely wrong. We will build a case: Let us
								assume that one John Smith is a clever amateur hypnotist. He chums with one Bill
								Jones and his wife, and Bill works in a bank. Smith and Jones and his wife are greatly
								interested in hypnotism, Smith having hypnotized both Jones and his wife dozens
								of times. All at once the hellish thought of taking advantage of Jones' wife takes
								possession of Smith. They meet one afternoon and Jones says to Smith, "I have got to go to the city this afternoon,
								and will not be back until late. Go up to the house, dine with my wife and keep
								her company until I return." Smith does so, that is, he goes to the house, and,
								after a few minutes' conversation, he says to Mrs. Jones, "By-the-by, I have a little
								experiment I would like to make. Close your eyes and go to sleep." She does. He
								then says to her, "When you open your eyes you are alone in your room with your
								husband. Now, open your eyes."
							</p>
							<!-- p 85 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Two senses must be impressed
							</p>
							<p>
								Can Smith take advantage of Mrs. Jones, and if not, why not? To put any thought
								into complete action at least two senses must be affected. The more senses affected
								the more active the thought (see barber and banjo players). She sees a picture of
								her husband, the room, et cetera, but there matters end, inasmuch as Smith's touch
								is not the touch of her husband; Smith's caresses are not the husband's; therefore,
								although she sees her husband, Smith is unable to supply the necessary suggestion
								to force her to respond to his desires. The suggestions (minor attributes) he offers
								forces her to respond positive against the commission of the act. I think it is
								made plain that no advantage can be taken while she is in hypnosis.
							</p>
							<p>
								Note. &ndash; All crime is committed free from hypnosis. The moment the accused
								acknowledges the commission of the act, <em>he has confessed himself guilty,</em>
								because all the attributes were furnished in the normal state and the act immediately
								committed, otherwise it could not have happened.

							<!-- p 86 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Purity in the operator
							</p>
							<p>
								A very learned&nbsp;(?) writer on hypnotism for one of the New York evening papers claims
								that to be a hypnotist a man must be pure, that his purity elevates the subject;
								that a bad&nbsp;(?) hypnotist, a man with impure thoughts, degrades the subject. Bosh!
								Other than putting them at natural or congenial degrading acts, I fail to see how
								the morals of the operator affects the subject. We cannot pour out of a measure
								what is not in it. If the subject be pure, nothing but purity can be reproduced,
								and <em>vice versa.</em>
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Is hypnosis injurious?
							</p>
							<p>
								Is a constant repetition of hypnosis injurious? If to reuse one's thoughts is detrimental,
								yes; but if the exercising of one's thoughts is development, then hypnosis is the
								grandest developer of the "mind" within the use of man. We can only revive thoughts
								the subject has had.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Much good derived
							</p>
							<p>
								I know of at least a dozen young men who, when they came onto my stage, were to
								all intents and purposes practically useless to themselves and the world, could
								hold no position; but, after being on my stage every night for a week while I was
								in the city, and afterwards being used by my pupils, they are so far advanced mentally
								that they are to-day holding good positions and are reputable men in the cities
								where they reside, and who, had they never met me, by this time would have been
								in some institution for criminals.

							</p>
							<!-- p 87 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Strength of mind
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, dear reader, what do you mean by "will power." I have heard that phrase so
								often, yet fail to comprehend it. I have met "strong-minded" men; in fact, I meet
								the "strong-minded" man in every town I visit; he is always the same, a slow correlator,
								his wife makes the living; he is so busy caring for that "strong mind" of his that
								he fails to find or hold a position. In fact, he devotes his entire time to looking
								after that "strong mind," and has no time for work.
							</p>
							<p>
								I suppose we can define what the world calls will power to be lack of correlative
								ability, density, thick-headedness. From my experience, if what the world calls
								will power is something admirable to possess, we should make marble statues of the
								jackass, place them in our rooms and bow before them as the exemplification of the
								"strongest-minded" of creatures, the possessors of the greatest "will power."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Exemplified in the jackass

							<p>
								A few winters ago I was in Texas, and one afternoon heard a great deal of swearing
								in the street. Of course, that is not unusual in some parts of Texas. This profanity
								was very artistic, I should imagine, from a swearer's point of view. I went to the
								window and, looking out, saw one of those "strong-minded" animals fastened to a
								cart. They were connected, the "strong-minded" animal having seemingly made up his
								mind not to move; and he would not, being "strong-minded." They beat him over the
								head, they swore at him, and I remarked to my secretary, who was standing near,
								"I am glad I am not 'strong-minded.' If I was in that animal's position, I would
								have had forced upon me the deduction that if I moved on they would stop beating
								me, and would move."
							</p>
							<!-- p 87 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Free&nbsp;(?) will
							</p>
							<p>
								In a little while they built a fire under the animal, and when the heat became intense,
								the most wonderful thing occurred, this "strong-minded animal," of its own free
								will, free from any external suggestion (after the fire got hot), changed his mind
								and moved, and, as far as I know, he is moving yet.
							</p>
							<p>
								One more illustration: When it becomes cloudy the man having the most ideas associated
								as to the ill that will come from getting wet, immediately goes under cover; when
								it sprinkles the man having the next most ideas associated gets under cover, and
								so until a downpour; if that deluge be hard enough, it will drive all men under
								cover or they will drown.
							</p>
							<p>
								The general public believes that if you wish to cure a man of any habit all that
								is necessary is to hypnotize him and tell him what he will do, and he will do so
								under any conditions. Foolish, ignorant public.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Sensing
							</p>
							<p>
								Sensing is always mistaken for telepathy. If you care to perform the following experiment,
								choose a slim subject, with a narrow head and big perceptives. When you desire to
								make mental tests, always choose a subject of a nervous mental disposition. I mean
								by that the quick mental, the narrow-headed man with big perceptives.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Physical tests
							</p>
							<p>
								When you want to produce physical tests, choose a "skinny" subject, the physically
								nervous. For example, to produce three pulsations in the body at one time is very
								easily performed with a "skinny" subject.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Catalepsy
							</p>
							<p>
								By-the-by, the best cataleptic subject is always a very thin fellow, one who looks
								as if he would break in two with the weight placed upon him, inasmuch as when his
								muscles are contracted there is a solid structure; but with the phlegmatic or lymphatic
								people, there is too much intervening tissue and we cannot get the contraction and
								solidity that is possible with the other.
							</p>
							<!-- p 89 -->
							<p>
								Seat your subject at a table; in front of him on the table lay down ten cards in
								a circle, face up. Have your subject go into hypnosis, and ask the spectators to
								stand around the table in a large circle, designating to them which card will be
								one, two, three, et cetera. Turn your back to the company and allow one of them
								to hold up his fingers, indicating the number of the card to be thought of; during
								which time the subject can be blindfolded, or any method you desire to use to be
								certain that he does not and cannot see. The moment they decide on the card have
								them tell you; you then tell them to very strongly will&nbsp;(?) that the subject shall
								push that card from out of the circle. Then say to your subject, "When you open
								your eyes, you will see on the table in front of you ten cards, beginning at your
								left, slowly pass your hand over all of the cards, and when you feel like pushing
								a certain card out of the circle, do so. Now, open your eyes."
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Telepathy&nbsp;(?)
							</p>
							<p>
								Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the subject will do this a half dozen times
								in succession, provided the spectators are anxious for the experiment to succeed
								and all think intently of the card. If the spectators are in another mood it will
								be impossible for the experiment to succeed. They will all acknowledge immediately
								that it is telepathy. It is nothing of the sort. It is what I call sensing, perfectly
								unconscious to the subject; yet he receives several distinct suggestions, as all,
								having their "minds" intently set on this card, will to a great degree hold their
								breath; when the subject comes to the right card they will allow the breath to exhale,
								which produces a pronounced atmospheric disturbance when the subject arrives at
								the card.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Acuteness of feeling
							</p>
							<p>
								Feeling is very definitely acted upon through the atmosphere. In fact, I am satisfied
								that a fairly sensitive subject &ndash; that means one whose nerve-ends are acute
								&ndash; can and does feel all fair sized objects; stoves, doors, book-cases and
								things of those kinds are perceptibly felt by a subject before he reaches them,
								thus forcing him to go around them.
							</p>
							<p>
								Note. &ndash; What he really feels is the resistance to the volume of air he is
								forcing before him when it is obstructed by a large object.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Sixth sense
							</p>
							<p>
								In 1895 I accidentally discovered that I could make or produce the following effects,
								and for want of a better term call it a sixth sense, or minus one.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lead your subject into hypnosis with his head falling well to the front; then place
								your thumb and second finger on each side of the wind-pipe; pressing the carotid
								arteries, and intently will&nbsp;(?) one of the following acts: that he should or will
								stand up, sit down, raise his right arm, lower it, his left arm the same; his two
								legs the same; open his eyes, close them, open his mouth, close it, stand up, sit
								down, evacuate or urinate. This is the limit.
							</p>
							<!-- p 91 -->
							<p>
								Instead of holding your thumb and finger on his throat, hold well against his neck
								under his chin a broom handle or a cane, keeping your hand firmly clasped, with
								your thumb pressing lightly on the cane or handle, and if you are possessed of great
								concentration, you will invariably succeed; those lacking in concentration will
								fail. The experiment is only satisfactory to those who personally succeed.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you will&nbsp;(?) that the right arm be raised and gaze intently at the left, standing
								where the subject cannot see if he could see, in nearly all cases the arm you are
								looking at will be raised, the same with the legs. Causing the subject to stand
								up or sit down, I do not think is fair, because if you are thinking of standing
								up the unconscious or involuntary action that is the result of the thought is certain
								to take place; the same with sitting down; I mean you will unconsciously yet very
								perceptibly lift him, or vice versa &ndash; the same as in alleged mind-reading.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								As in Mind-reading&nbsp;(?)
							</p>
							<p>
								The degree of steadiness of your thought is exemplified in the moving or raising
								of the limb. If you think steadily the limb will raise steadily, if you think spasmodically,
								the movement will be spasmodic, in fact the action will be the exact reproduction
								of your thought. I have had friends with whom this act was no effort; they could
								take any subject and produce a quick response. I have had others who could hardly
								affect them. I can only get a movement in the limbs; the hand will twitch, the fingers
								will twitch, arm will move a little, but very little, I cannot raise it, inasmuch
								as I lack the steady concentration.

								Cerebrum vs. Abdominal Brain
							</p>
							<p>
								This demonstration is a case of the operator's cerebrum affecting the subject's
								Sympathetic System or Abdominal Brain, as his cerebrum is inactive; or, in other
								words, this is an illustration which I lack the ability to make you comprehend.
								The cerebrum of a subject does not work. In this case the operator's cerebrum is
								taking the place of the subject's cerebrum.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Post-hypnosis&nbsp;(?)
							</p>
							<p>
								Post-hypnotic suggestion (which I call a deferred inspiration) is a misnomer, inasmuch
								as no inspiration given in hypnosis (so-called), can happen except in hypnosis.
								We tell a subject that when he opens his eyes he will see and feel a fly on his
								nose, that produces an instant response, if we do not actually awaken him. We tell
								him that in five minutes, one hour, one day, six months, after he opens his eyes,
								a fly will alight on his nose, he will feel it bite, et cetera, it will fail if
								the time be deferred over two hours. But, if we say to him (and he must be an exceptionally
								good subject), "When you open your eyes, one week from to-day when the town clock
								strikes eleven, you will see and feel a fly on your nose, et cetera," you will succeed,
								for you have really said, "One week from to-day when the clock strikes eleven, you
								will go into hypnosis; a fly, et cetera." If he be a good subject, one that will
								hold an inspiration for several hours, and he hears the clock strike, you can see
								him take on hypnosis, then the inspiration. Remember, no operator other than myself
								and my pupils ever <em>awakened</em> their subjects. They inspired them with the
								thought of being awake, the same as with the thought of a fly, and allowed the subjects
								to slowly pass into a "normal" awakening. If the subject is actually awakened there
								will be <em>no "post-hypnotic" effect.</em>

								Sleeping suggestions

							<p>
								Sleeping suggestions in the hands of a clever mother are a most potent factor in
								guiding the child. Tell the child that when she goes to sleep to-night you are going
								to her bedside and talk to her; that she must remain asleep. After the child is
								asleep, go to the bedside and you will find her in an easy position, with inactive
								mind, upturned eye and closed eye. Now quietly and soothingly speak to the child,
								call her by name and say, "Bessie, remain asleep." The moment that you have aroused
								the thought, you will have hypnosis, which your baby has shown by a long, deep sigh,
								or the movement of some limb. Then say to her, "When you awaken in the morning you
								will do so and so, you will have a good appetite," or whatever inspiration you desire
								to give, and then quietly go out of the room. But mind, you cannot raise or force
								in action any thought which is not there, it must be within the comprehension
								of the child, and be something other than antagonistic. This is really the most
								delightful phase of the entire art of hypnosis.

								Now, doctor, if you are at a bedside and desirous of inducing sleep in your patient,

								You will note that I use two words &ndash; "inspiration" and "suggestion." I inspire

								me that Mrs. Jones has been suffering from headaches; he inspired her with the thought
								of "no headache" and she went away seemingly all right, which immediately informs
								me that he hypnotized her; but if he writes me that she called and he suggested
								to her "no headache," I know that he did not hypnotize her. He may have stroked
								her head, assured her that the headache would pass away; he may have given her a
								blank pill, or even a drug. He used methods other than hypnosis, but obeyed the
								law that is demonstrated in hypnosis.

								Pain is a thought; the suggestion or cause exists. I pinch your arm; where do you

								not feel it. You feel it in the brain. Oh, yes. In the brain; then it is thought.
								Baby comes crying to mother &ndash; she has hurt her hand; mamma kisses it and the
								baby goes away smiling; the mother being scientific&nbsp;(?), instead of nursing the
								pretty thought that a kiss from mamma will remove pain, teaches the child to be
								afraid, and adds attributes &ndash; including the doctor &ndash; and by and by the
								child has associated with the thought of doctor only a man who gives nasty medicine
								and hurts. Teach the children that pain is something to be laughed at; fail to add
								attributes to pain &ndash; arouse thoughts of "no pain." I would rather spank a
								child for getting hurt than to console it. If we spank it, it will think of the
								spanking, and will have a little more pain, perhaps; though not at the seat of the
								original trouble. I have seen children of ten years, in families of mental scientists,
								hold their fingers over burning matches until blistered, exhibiting no signs of
								pain.

								A beautiful demonstration

								You hypnotize a clever subject and tell him that he has no finger; you can then

								there is nothing to be hurt, a most beautiful demonstration; but, my dear hypnotist,
								do not try this on a fool, because he will "holler" unless you are smart. Tell him
								he has no finger, it is gone; then explain to the audience that as he has no finger,
								it is impossible for him to have pain from it; he cannot avoid responding to your
								inspiration, the audience thinking you are talking to them, when in truth you are
								talking to your subject; you can then stick pins in his finger and be safe.
							</p>
							<p>
								Again, if you inspire the subject with the thought of "no feeling," put a pin into
								him, and then commence talking to your audience about it, you will find your subject
								will begin to howl; or if, after you have withdrawn the pin and have a cowardly
								subject, you draw the audience's attention to the fact that he might have the nerve
								to stand the putting in of the pin, but he could not control the flow of blood,

								putting him through a performance of jumping out of hot chairs, and brushing flies
								off his nose, et cetera, I inspired him with the thought of "no feeling," and, we
								will say, stuck a hat pin through his left ear, afterward taking him among the audience,
								allowing the doctors and others to examine him. I removed the pin, put him through
								more "monkey-shines" and ultimately awakened him.
							</p>
							<!-- p 98 -->
							<p>
								As he started to leave the hall, the doctor said to him, "Did Mr. Santanelli hurt
								you when he stuck those pins in you?"
							</p>
							<p>
								"No, suh; he done stick no pins in me, suh;" and the left hand rubbed the left ear.
								If I had pierced his right ear, he would always put his hand up to that ear. There
								was no question but that he was thoroughly <em>unconscious</em> of the pin having
								been put into him. Why and wherefore, then, was the hand always put to the proper
								place, if the Sympathetic System does not receive impressions? A hypnotized subject
								does not use his cerebrum.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Statuary
							</p>
							<p>
								In my "Living Statuary," where I inspire the subjects with, "When you open your
								eyes you will juggle balls in the air; when I call now you will be stiff as iron,
								stone, you cannot move a muscle; now open your eyes;" they go to juggling, I call,
								"now," and they are perfectly rigid in whatever position they are in when I speak
								the word, "now"; their eyes are immovable.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Change of thought
							</p>
							<p>
								It was here I first learned that the eye blinks every time one gets a different
								or new thought. I tell the subjects to close their eyes, and their hands drop to
								their sides and they are limber. If one is not expert the subjects will fall. If
								a subject, during the "statuary," is put to whistling, and I call, "now," he will
								stop; when I release him he will complete the whistle.
							</p>
							<!-- p 99 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Completing action
							</p>
							<p>
								If he is uttering a word he will stop and when I release him he will complete the
								word, something that no "normal" being can do; the same with sneezing.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the subjects are baseball pitchers I stop them in the middle of an action,
								and when I release them they complete the action. One evening, in Kentucky, the
								boys were defending themselves from an eagle; one of them had his coat off and started
								throwing it at the eagle; I produced the catalepsy, and when I released him out
								of that rigidity the coat passed or was thrown into the gallery of the theater.
								Where did he get the energy, how did he complete the action? The "mind" will hold
								but one thought at a time. When they open their eyes they are jugglers going through
								the actions they have seen jugglers perform. When I call "now" to them they think
								of rigidity, the action of which thought is catalepsy, when I tell them to close
								their eyes, they think of relaxation, yet complete the first thought, having a third
								thought in their "mind," an utterly impossible thing to conceive, other than that
								action is received and executed by separate brain conditions.

							<p class="sidenote">
								Abdominal brain
							</p>
							<p>
								It was through noting these effects that in 1895 I preached an Abdominal Brain.
								At that time, having no comprehension as to what I was talking about, but being
								familiar enough with actions of the subjects to note that it was an utter impossibility
								for all to be done with the brain system as now understood&nbsp;(?).

							<p>
								Now, dear reader, we have covered all the different phases of hypnosis, how and
								why it is, how to induce it, et cetera. This book answers all questions as to hypnosis
								if you have the comprehension to pick them out. On the premise here given you, I
								have yet to fail to give a logical and comprehensive explanation to the thousands
								of questions asked me by students, doctors, ministers, lawyers and laymen before
								whom I lecture.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Memory&nbsp;(?)
							</p>
							<p>
								You are satisfied if you comprehend; yet a most important question you have failed
								to ask me &ndash; not you who have not tried, but the amateurs. I lead into hypnosis
								Mrs. Santanelli and tell her when she opens her eyes she will find in her lap an
								object which she will describe to me; to open her eyes; she does so, takes up the
								object and describes it. While she is describing it, I say, "all right" and clap
								my hands; she awakens, and I ask her what she has been doing and she has no memory
								whatever.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								No memory
							</p>
							<p>
								I have her again take on hypnosis, ask her what she was doing in the last "hypnosis,"
								and she tells me. Why is it the hypnotized subject has no memory of what has taken
								place in "hypnosis" when he is actually awake, yet while in "hypnosis" has a memory
								of the previous hypnosis? Why this contradiction, what does it mean? How is it that
								the subject does not see his present environment, but sees the environment of the
								picture I arouse for him? Why this contradiction? I will explain it to you.
							</p>
							<!-- p 101 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Memory defined
							</p>
							<p>
								Memory is the registration of ideas. The subject, having no memory, proves that
								nothing has been registered cerebrally; again, it is impossible to register through
								one sense that which the economy of man intended to be registered through another.
								Therefore, we put nothing in through the cerebrum. When I talk to a subject he does
								not hear me cerebrally, if he did he would always remember what I said to him. The
								subject only responds to me.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Consciousness
							</p>
							<p>
								Consciousness, realization, is cerebral. Sense impressions pass through the cerebrum
								yet are actually registered in the Sympathetic System. Every cerebral nerve is accompanied
								by a sympathetic nerve. Many sympathetic nerves are alone. This makes the so-called
								brain system a two-wire system.
							</p>
							<p class="sidenote">
								Insulation
							</p>
							<p>
								I believe it to be a <em>three-wire</em> system. I say to a hypnotized subject, "You have no feeling in your finger" (touching the finger); the Sympathetic System immediately
								contracts the tissue over the cerebral nerve and insulates it; yet the Sympathetic System is conscious of any irritation that I make on the designated place, showing
								that it receives the impression free of the cerebrum. The Sympathetic System can work free and independently of the cerebral, but the cerebrum cannot work free of
								the sympathetic, because the sympathetic is the actual machinery that does the work, the cerebral brain simply being the realizing brain.
							</p>
							<!-- p 102 -->
							<p class="sidenote">
								Decapitated
							</p>
							<p>
								In a hypnotized subject the cerebrum is inactive, as in hypnosis the impulse is
								received through and responded to by the Sympathetic System. The experiment made
								by all students of decapitating a frog, irritating a nerve-end and the "normal"
								action taking place, proves my affirmation. A hypnotized subject is as a decapitated
								being. Feeling is never eliminated until death. Conscious feeling &ndash; yes. If
								the Abdominal Brain did not know what was taking place it would lose its control
								over the body, therefore, feeling as to the Sympathetic System cannot be obliterated.

							<p>
								[Henry] Hudson's philosophy of objective and subjective mind will not hold water,
								inasmuch as it is based on the premise than man is a free agent and can discriminate.
								Now, this subject is so thoroughly illustrated in the barber story, the banjo story,
								the story of crime, that really it is not worthy of discussion, although the entire
								public has seemingly endorsed a most false theory, manufactured to explain a condition
								that the alleged "authority" was not capable of explaining.

								One mind
							</p>
							<p>
								We have but <em>one</em> mind; we are entirely creatures of our environment; our
