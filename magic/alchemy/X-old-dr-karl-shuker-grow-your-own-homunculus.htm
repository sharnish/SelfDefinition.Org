                                    Even today, the alchemists of medieval times remain famous for their supposed (but
                                    unconfirmed) ability to transmute base metals into gold, using the fabled philosopher&#39;s
                                    stone. Less well-remembered, yet even more controversial, is their alleged artificial
                                    creation of tiny living humanoids - known as homunculi. Some references to homunculi
                                    in alchemical texts featured them as symbolic rather than literal. For instance,
                                    the fabled Philosopher&#39;s Stone is sometimes considered to be a homunculus, with
                                    its creation no less than the representation of the Great Work (Magnum Opus) process,
                                    merely described in a different way.<br />
                                    <br />

                                    In September 1994, however, Paul Thompson published an engrossing review of this
                                    largely-forgotten arcane subject in America&#39;s<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Fate
                                        Magazine</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>that contained
                                    some remarkable revelations regarding the alleged creation of living homunculi.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Alchemists claimed that the culture medium required for the growth of homunculi
                                    contained several biological fluids such as sputum or egg-white, and sometimes inorganic
                                    fluids like dew, but the two substances most commonly cited as essential were human
                                    blood and semen - both of which are widely believed in primitive or non-scientific
                                    societies to harbour the vital essence of life. Also required was horse manure,
                                    whose heat-releasing properties were utilised to incubate the medium.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Bearing in mind that all of the above ingredients are readily obtainable, why was
                                    the production of homunculi a skill restricted to alchemists? The answer is that
                                    the recipes always seemed to contain one vital ingredient that was exceptionally
                                    complex and difficult to prepare.<br />

                                    For example, in the homunculus recipe contained within the treatise&nbsp;<em>De Natura
                                        Rerum</em>, written by 16th-Century Swiss scholar and alchemist Theophrastus
                                    Paracelsus (aka Philippus von Hohenheim), &#39;the arcanum of human blood&#39; was
                                    included - essential but esoteric, its constituents known only to the alchemical
                                    fraternity. Here, just in case any reader wishes to attempt it himself, is Paracelsus&#39;s
                                    description of how to create a homunculus:<br />

                                        like a human being, but, nevertheless, transparent and without body. If now, after

                                        and it should be afterwards educated with the greatest care and zeal, until it grows
                                        up and begins to display intelligence.&quot;<br />

                                    The vaguely human-looking root of the mandragora or mandrake plant&nbsp;<em>Mandragora
                                        officinarum</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>inspired the
                                    false belief during medieval times that it could be utilised in the production of
                                    homunculi. During his body&#39;s last convulsive spasms before death, a hanged man
                                    will sometimes ejaculate semen, and it was said that where this fell to the ground,
                                    a mandrake would grow. If its anthropomorphic root was then pulled out before dawn
                                    on a Friday morning by a black dog, then washed, and nurtured with milk, honey,
                                    and sometimes human blood too, the root would subsequently develop into a homunculus,
                                    which would guard and protect its owner.<br />
                                    <br />

                                    An even more exotic recipe for growing your own homunculus was cited during the
                                    1700s by no less a figure of learning than Dr David Christianus from Germany&#39;s
                                    Giessen University. According to his claim, an egg should be taken from a black
                                    hen, and a tiny hole should be poked through its shell. A bean-sized portion of
                                    the albumen then needed to be removed and replaced by human semen, after which the
                                    egg&#39;s opening should be sealed with the hymen from a virgin maiden. Once this
                                    was accomplished, the egg must be buried in dung during the first day of the March
                                    lunar cycle. After 30 days, a homunculus should emerge from the egg, and as long
                                    as its owner provided it with a regular diet of earthworms and lavender seeds it
                                    would protect him and assist him in all of his endeavours.<br />

                                    Notwithstanding the inherent difficulties in obtaining the necessary ingredients
                                    and in performing the intricate series of processes required, records detailing
                                    the successful culturing of homunculi do exist. An extraordinary specimen grown
                                    from distilled human blood and able to emit beams of red light was reputedly cultured
                                    and exhibited at the court of France&#39;s King Louis XIV by royal physician Dr
                                    Borel.<br />

                                    As fully documented in Dr Emil Besetzny&#39;s book<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Sphinx</em><span
                                        class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(1873), however, the most outstanding
                                    case must surely be the creation of ten living homunculi in a mere five weeks, accomplished
                                    by two Austrian alchemists from the late 16th Century - Count Johann Ferdinand von
                                    Kufstein and Abbé Geloni.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Like all homunculi, they were grown in sealed jars (homunculi die if exposed for
                                    any considerable period to the air), filled with water and eventually buried under
                                    heaps of manure. These were treated (as usual) with some special, but unspecified,
                                    solution, and doubled the size of eight of the homunculi, producing a series of
                                    1-ft-tall specimens.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    No two homunculi looked the same, and to each was fixed an identity. Eight were
                                    physical manikins, known respectively as the king, queen, knight, monk, nun, seraph,
                                    miner, and architect, and clothes pertinent to their identities were manufactured
                                    for them. Each of these eight homunculi was fed with special pink tablets every
                                    3-4 days, and their water was changed once a week. On at least one occasion, the
                                    &#39;king&#39; homunculus escaped from his jar, and was earnestly trying to remove
                                    the seal on the jar housing the &#39;queen&#39; when he was spotted by Count Kufstein&#39;s
                                    butler. Chased by Kufstein and the butler, the &#39;king&#39; soon fainted from
                                    exposure to the air, and was put back inside his own receptacle.<br />

                                    The remaining two homunculi were non-corporeal, and only appeared when Geloni tapped
                                    their jars and chanted certain magical words. A face would then materialise in each
                                    of them; moreover, in one the liquid would turn blue, in the other it would turn
                                    red. The red &#39;spirit&#39; homunculus was fed on blood, and its water was changed
                                    every 2-3 days, but the blue &#39;spirit&#39; homunculus was never fed and its water
                                    was never changed.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    All ten homunculi would answer questions concerning future events, invariably predicting
                                    correctly the outcomes, and they were observed by many people. These included some
                                    very notable personages, like Count Franz Josef von Thun and Count Max Lamberg.
                                    Surely, however, such bizarre man-made entities could not really have existed -
                                    or could they?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    I cannot help but wonder whether these particular homunculi were nothing more than
                                    large amphibians brought back by travellers from the tropics. One likely candidate
                                    is the African clawed toad<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Xenopus
                                        laevis</em>, a common species vaguely humanoid in shape, which lives permanently
                                    in water - explaining why the &#39;king&#39; fainted soon after escaping from its
                                    jar?<br />
                                    <br />

                                    No-one knows what happened to nine of the homunculi after Geloni and Kufstein ultimately
                                    went their separate ways. However, an event occurred that may actually have left
                                    behind some tangible evidence of the tenth. Once, the jar containing the &#39;monk&#39;
                                    homunculus was accidentally dropped, smashing as it hit the floor and killing its
                                    humanoid inhabitant. His body was afterwards buried in the grounds of Kufstein&#39;s
                                    Tyrolean residence - but where is this today? If only we knew its locality, the
                                    soil around it could be sifted, as suggested by Paul Thompson - and who knows what
                                    remains might be found?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    One thing is certain. If a 12-in-long skeleton is ever found under these circumstances,
                                    Thompson would be very interested to learn more about it - and so would I.<br />
