								Even today, the alchemists of medieval times remain famous for their supposed (but
								unconfirmed) ability to transmute base metals into gold, using the fabled philosopher&#39;s
								stone. Less well-remembered, yet even more controversial, is their alleged artificial
								creation of tiny living humanoids - known as homunculi. Some references to homunculi
								in alchemical texts featured them as symbolic rather than literal. For instance,
								the fabled Philosopher&#39;s Stone is sometimes considered to be a homunculus, with
								its creation no less than the representation of the Great Work (Magnum Opus) process,
								merely described in a different way.

							</p>
							<p>

								In September 1994, however, Paul Thompson published an engrossing review of this
								largely-forgotten arcane subject in America&#39;s<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Fate
									Magazine</em> <sup class="inherit">*</sup> that contained
								some remarkable revelations regarding the alleged creation of living homunculi.

								Alchemists claimed that the culture medium required for the growth of homunculi
								contained several biological fluids such as sputum or egg-white, and sometimes inorganic
								fluids like dew, but the two substances most commonly cited as essential were human
								blood and semen - both of which are widely believed in primitive or non-scientific
								societies to harbour the vital essence of life. Also required was horse manure,
								whose heat-releasing properties were utilised to incubate the medium.
							</p>
							<p>

								Bearing in mind that all of the above ingredients are readily obtainable, why was
								the production of homunculi a skill restricted to alchemists? The answer is that
								the recipes always seemed to contain one vital ingredient that was exceptionally
								complex and difficult to prepare.

								For example, in the homunculus recipe contained within the treatise&nbsp;<em>De Natura
									Rerum</em>, written by 16th-Century Swiss scholar and alchemist Theophrastus
								Paracelsus (aka Philippus von Hohenheim), &#39;the arcanum of human blood&#39; was
								included - essential but esoteric, its constituents known only to the alchemical
								fraternity. Here, just in case any reader wishes to attempt it himself, is Paracelsus&#39;s
								description of how to create a homunculus:
							</p>
							<p class="spell blockquote">

								&quot;Let the semen of a man putrefy by itself
								in a sealed cucurbite [glass vessel] with the highest putrefaction of the venter
								equinus [horse manure] for 40 days, or until it begins at last to live, move, and
								be agitated, which can easily be seen. After this time it will be in some degree
								like a human being, but, nevertheless, transparent and without body. If now, after
								this, it be every day nourished and fed cautiously and prudently with the arcanum
								of human blood, and kept for 40 weeks in the perpetual and equal heat of a venter
								equinus, it becomes, thenceforth, a true and living infant, having all the members
								of a child that is born from a woman, but much smaller. This we call a homunculus;
								and it should be afterwards educated with the greatest care and zeal, until it grows
								up and begins to display intelligence.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								Equally obscure is &#39;animal tincture&#39;, listed in another medieval
								recipe.
							</p>
							<p>

								The vaguely human-looking root of the mandragora or mandrake plant&nbsp;<em>Mandragora
									officinarum</em> inspired the
								false belief during medieval times that it could be utilised in the production of
								homunculi. During his body&#39;s last convulsive spasms before death, a hanged man
								will sometimes ejaculate semen, and it was said that where this fell to the ground,
								a mandrake would grow. If its anthropomorphic root was then pulled out before dawn
								on a Friday morning by a black dog, then washed, and nurtured with milk, honey,
								and sometimes human blood too, the root would subsequently develop into a homunculus,
								which would guard and protect its owner.
							</p>

									root, depicted in<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Tacuinum Sanitatis</em>,

								</p>
							</div>
							<p>

								An even more exotic recipe for growing your own homunculus was cited during the
								1700s by no less a figure of learning than Dr David Christianus from Germany&#39;s
								Giessen University. According to his claim, an egg should be taken from a black
								hen, and a tiny hole should be poked through its shell. A bean-sized portion of
								the albumen then needed to be removed and replaced by human semen, after which the
								egg&#39;s opening should be sealed with the hymen from a virgin maiden. Once this
								was accomplished, the egg must be buried in dung during the first day of the March
								lunar cycle. After 30 days, a homunculus should emerge from the egg, and as long
								as its owner provided it with a regular diet of earthworms and lavender seeds it
								would protect him and assist him in all of his endeavours.
							</p>
							<p>

								Notwithstanding the inherent difficulties in obtaining the necessary ingredients
								and in performing the intricate series of processes required, records detailing
								the successful culturing of homunculi do exist. An extraordinary specimen grown
								from distilled human blood and able to emit beams of red light was reputedly cultured
								and exhibited at the court of France&#39;s King Louis XIV by royal physician Dr
								Borel.

							<p>

								As fully documented in Dr Emil Besetzny&#39;s book<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Sphinx</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(1873), however, the most outstanding
								case must surely be the creation of ten living homunculi in a mere five weeks, accomplished by two Austrian alchemists from the late 16th Century - Count Johann Ferdinand von Kufstein and Abbé Geloni.
							</p>
							<p>

								Like all homunculi, they were grown in sealed jars (homunculi die if exposed for
								any considerable period to the air), filled with water and eventually buried under
								heaps of manure. These were treated (as usual) with some special, but unspecified,
								solution, and doubled the size of eight of the homunculi, producing a series of
								1-ft-tall specimens.
							</p>
							<p>

								No two homunculi looked the same, and to each was fixed an identity. Eight were
								physical manikins, known respectively as the king, queen, knight, monk, nun, seraph,
								miner, and architect, and clothes pertinent to their identities were manufactured
								for them. Each of these eight homunculi was fed with special pink tablets every
								3-4 days, and their water was changed once a week. On at least one occasion, the
								&#39;king&#39; homunculus escaped from his jar, and was earnestly trying to remove
								the seal on the jar housing the &#39;queen&#39; when he was spotted by Count Kufstein&#39;s
								butler. Chased by Kufstein and the butler, the &#39;king&#39; soon fainted from
								exposure to the air, and was put back inside his own receptacle.
							</p>
							<p>

								The remaining two homunculi were non-corporeal, and only appeared when Geloni tapped
								their jars and chanted certain magical words. A face would then materialise in each
								of them; moreover, in one the liquid would turn blue, in the other it would turn
								red. The red &#39;spirit&#39; homunculus was fed on blood, and its water was changed
								every 2-3 days, but the blue &#39;spirit&#39; homunculus was never fed and its water
								was never changed.
							</p>
							<p>

								All ten homunculi would answer questions concerning future events, invariably predicting
								correctly the outcomes, and they were observed by many people. These included some
								very notable personages, like Count Franz Josef von Thun and Count Max Lamberg.
								Surely, however, such bizarre man-made entities could not really have existed -
								or could they?
							</p>
							<p>

								I cannot help but wonder whether these particular homunculi were nothing more than
								large amphibians brought back by travellers from the tropics. One likely candidate
								is the African clawed toad<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>Xenopus
									laevis</em>, a common species vaguely humanoid in shape, which lives permanently
								in water - explaining why the &#39;king&#39; fainted soon after escaping from its
								jar?
							</p>

								<p class="caption">

								</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								No-one knows what happened to nine of the homunculi after Geloni and Kufstein ultimately
								went their separate ways. However, an event occurred that may actually have left
								behind some tangible evidence of the tenth. Once, the jar containing the &#39;monk&#39;
								homunculus was accidentally dropped, smashing as it hit the floor and killing its
								humanoid inhabitant. His body was afterwards buried in the grounds of Kufstein&#39;s
								Tyrolean residence - but where is this today? If only we knew its locality, the
								soil around it could be sifted, as suggested by Paul Thompson - and who knows what
								remains might be found?
							</p>
							<p>
								One thing is certain. If a 12-in-long skeleton is ever found under these circumstances,
								Thompson would be very interested to learn more about it - and so would I.
