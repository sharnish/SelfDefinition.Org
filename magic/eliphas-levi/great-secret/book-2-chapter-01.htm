								Magnetism is a force analogous to that of the ordinary magnet, and permeates the
								whole of nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								Its characteristics are: attraction, repulsion and a balanced polarization.
							</p>
							<p>
								Science takes account of celestial and mineral magnetism. Animal magnetism is exhibited
								daily in facts which science is unable to deny; but it regards them with mistrust,
								and rightly waits to admit them whenever analysis can be supplemented by an
								incontrovertible
								synthesis.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is well known that the magnetic state produced by animal magnetism brings about
								an unusual type of sleep during which the soul of the magnetized individual falls
								under the domination of the magnetizer, with this peculiarity that the sleeper seems
								to leave his own life unoccupied and shows only those phenomena which belong to
								the universal life. He reflects the thoughts of others, sees without using his eyes,
								visits all places without any recognition of space, perceives forms much better
								than colours, foreshortens or confuses periods of time, speaks of the future as
								if it were past and of the past as if it were still to come, tells the magnetizer
								the latter's thoughts -- even the secret voice of his conscience, summons into his
								memory the people of whom he is thinking and describes them in the greatest detail,
								even though the clairvoyant has never seen them, speaks the language of science
								like a scholar and that of the imagination like a poet, diagnoses diseases and finds
								the remedies for them, often imparts wise advice, suffers with those who suffer
								and sometimes cries bitterly beforehand when revealing the distress which has to
								come.
							</p>
							<p>
								These strange but incontestable facts lead us to the necessary conclusion that there
								is a common life shared by all souls; or at least a common mirror for every imagination
								and every memory, in which it is possible for us to gaze at one another like a crowd
								of people standing before a glass. This reflector is the odic light of Baron
								Reichenbach,
								which we call the astral light, and is the great agency of life termed <i>od</i>,
								<i>ob</i> and <i>aour</i> by the Hebrews. The magnetism controlled by the will of
								the operator is Od; that of passive clairvoyance is Ob: the pythonesses of antiquity
								were clairvoyantes intoxicated with the passive astral light. This light is called
								the spirit of Python in our holy books, because in Greek mythology the serpent Python
								is its allegorical representative.
							</p>
							<p>
								In its double action, it is also represented by the serpent of the caduceus: the
								right-hand serpent is Od, the one on the left is Ob and, in the middle, at the top
								of the hermetic staff, shines the golden globe which represents Aour, or light in
								equilibrium.
							</p>
							<p>
								Od represents life governed by free choice, Ob represents life ruled by fate. This
								is why the Hebrew Law-giver said: 'Woe to those who divine by Ob, because they evoke
								fate, which is an offence against the providence of God and the liberty of man.'
							</p>
							<p>
								Certainly, there is a wide difference between the serpent Python, which crawled
								in the mud of the deluge and was shot by the sun's arrows, and that which coils
								around the rod of Aesculapius, just as the tempter serpent of Eden differs from
								the brazen serpent which cured those who were poisoned in the desert. These two
								antagonistic serpents really stand for those contrary forces which may be connected
								but never confused. Hermes' sceptre, while keeping them apart, also reconciles them,
								and even unites them in a way; and this is how, under the penetrating eyes of science,
								harmony arises from the analogy of contraries.
							</p>
							<p>
								Necessity and Liberty, these are the two great laws of life; and properly speaking
								these two laws only make one, because they are both indispensable.
							</p>
							<p>
								Necessity without liberty would be fatal, even as liberty without its necessary
								curb would go insane. Privilege without obligation is folly, and obligation without
								privilege is slavery.
							</p>
							<p>
								The whole secret of magnetism lies here: to rule the fatality of the <i>ob</i> by
								intelligence and the power of the <i>od</i> so as to create the perfect balance
								of <i>aour</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								When an unbalanced magnetizer, who has been made the slave of fate by the passions
								that master him, tries to operate on the light of fate, he is like a blindfold man
								on a blind horse, endeavouring to spur it into a gallop in a forest full of winding
								tracks and cliff-edges.
							</p>
							<p>
								The fortune-tellers, the card-readers, the clairvoyants are all of them the subjects
								of hallucination who make their predictions by <i>ob</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The glass of water in hydromancy, the tarot of Etteila, the lines in the palm, etc.,
								produce a kind of hypnotism in the seer. Thus he regards his consultant in the
								reflection
								of his own silly desires or greedy imaginations; and because he is himself a spirit
								without dignity or nobility of will, he divines his client's follies and suggests
								to him even greater ones, which is all a part of his success so he thinks.
							</p>
							<p>
								A card-reader who counselled honesty and upright behaviour would soon lose his clientele
								of kept women and hysterical old maids.
							</p>
							<p>
								The two magnetic lights may be called one the living light and the other the dead
								light, one the astral fluid and the other the spectral phosphorus, one the torch
								of discourse and the other the smoke of dreams.
							</p>
							<p>
								To magnetize without danger, it is essential to have within oneself the light of
								life, that is to say it is necessary to be wise and righteous.
							</p>
							<p>
								The man who is a slave to his passions does not magnetize, he fascinates; but in
								radiating his fascination he enlarges the giddy circle around him; he multiplies
								his spells and saps his will power more and more. He is like a spider which wears
								itself out and is finally caught in its own web.
							</p>
							<p>
								Humanity has not yet known the supreme rule of reason, even today; they mistake
								it for each man's personal and almost always erroneous rationalizing. However, Mr
								de La Palice himself would tell them that he who deceives himself is not a man of
								reason, for reason is just the exact opposite of our errors.
							</p>
							<p>
								The individuals and masses who are not governed by reason are the slaves of fate;
								fate makes public opinion and opinion is queen of the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								Men want to be dominated, tranquillized and led away. The major cravings seem more
								beautiful to them than virtues do, and those whom they call great men are often
								the big fools. The cynicism of Diogenes pleases them like the charlatanism of
								Empedocles.
								There would be none they would admire so much as Ajax and Capaneus if Polyeucte
								had not been wilder still. Pyramus and Thisbe -- who killed themselves -- are the
								model lovers. The author of a paradox is always certain to make his name. And the
								world in its spite and envy has tried in vain to consign the name of Erostratus
								to oblivion, this name is so abnormal that it survives in their anger and imprints
								itself eternally on their memory!
							</p>
							<p>
								The fools then are magnetizers or rather fascinators, and this is what makes their
								folly contagious. Because they have failed to measure true greatness, people get
								taken up with what is exotic.
							</p>
							<p>
								Children who have not yet learnt to walk wish to be picked up and carried about.
							</p>
							<p>
								Nobody likes wild behaviour as much as the impotent do. It is their incapacity for
								pleasure which makes characters like Tiberius and Messalina. The Parisian street-arab
								in his paradise on the boulevards would like to be a bandit and laughs uproariously
								on seeing Telemachus ridiculed.
							</p>
							<p>
								Not everybody has the inclinations of drug addicts or alcoholics, but almost everyone
								would like to get his spirit 'high' and would be happy enough if his heart 'went
								on a trip'.
							</p>
							<p>
								When Christianity imposed itself on the world by the fascination of martyrdom, a
								great writer of that period put the thoughts of everyone into words when he said:
								'I believe because it is irrational!'
							</p>
							<p>
								The foolishness of the Cross, as Saint Paul himself called it, was then on its
								invincible
								march. The books of the adepts were burnt, and Saint Paul at Ephesus preluded the
								exploits of Omar. The temples were demolished which had been the wonders of the
								world, and the idols which had been artistic masterpieces. People developed the
								taste for death and wanted to despoil their transient existence of all its ornaments
								so that they might withdraw from life.
							</p>
							<p>
								A distaste for realities always goes with a love of dreams: <i>Quam sordet tellus dum
									coelum aspicio!</i> said a famous mystic. This means literally: How sordid the
								earth becomes when I look at the sky! How so; does your nurse, the earth, get dirty
								when your gaze loses itself in space? What is the earth then, if she is not a heavenly
								body? Perhaps she is dirty because she has to carry you around with her? No doubt
								if you were transported to the sun, the sun would soon appear tarnished to your
								finicky eye! Would the sky be a better place if it were empty? Isn't it just the
								point that it is so wonderful to look at because it lights up the earth by day and,
								in the night, shines with a countless multitude of earths and suns? What, the splended
								earth, the earth of immense oceans, the earth so full of trees and flowers becomes
								filth to you because you want to be launched into space? Believe me, you do not
								need to travel far for that: the void is in your spirit and in your heart!
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the love of dreams which mixes so much suffering with the dreams of love.
								Love, as it is given to us by nature, is a delightful reality, but our unhealthy
								pride looks for something better than nature; hence the hysterical mania of the
								misunderstood. The thought of Charlotte, in Werther's head, is fatally transformed
								-- as is only inevitable -- into the shape of a pistol bullet. The outcome of
								preposterous
								love is suicide.
							</p>
							<p>
								True love, natural love, is the miracle of magnetism. It is the intertwining of
								the two serpents of the caduceus. Its generation looks fated, but it is brought
								into being by the supreme reason which produces it according to natural laws. It
								is fabled that Tiresias incurred the wrath of Venus for separating two serpents
								who were copulating, and became a hermaphrodite: which neutralized his sexual potency;
								then the angry goddess struck him again, blinding him, because he had claimed for
								the woman that which was mainly the right of the man. Tiresias was a soothsayer
								who prophesied by means of the dead light. His predictions, too, announced misfortunes,
								and always seemed to be caused by misfortunes. This allegory sums up the entire
								philosophy of magnetism which we have just revealed.
