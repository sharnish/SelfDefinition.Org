								Perpetual motion is the eternal law of life. Like human respiration, it manifests
								everywhere in attraction and repulsion. Every action provokes a reaction; every
								reaction is proportional to the action which provoked it. A harmonious action produces
								its harmonious counterpart. A discordant action necessitates a reaction which will
								look ill- regulated but will be, in reality, a balancing one. If you fight violence
								with violence, you will perpetuate violence; but if you oppose it with the strength
								of meekness, you will enable meekness to triumph and violence will be broken. Some
								truths seem to be opposed to one another, because perpetual motion causes them to
								triumph in turn again and again. The day exists and the night exists too; they exist
								simultaneously but not in the same half of the globe. There are shadows by day and
								twinkling lights at night, and the daytime shadows make the day sparkle while the
								glimmering at night seems to intensify its blackness. Hence visible day and visible
								night are such to our eyes alone. The eternal light is invisible to mortal eyes
								and fills infinity. Truth is the day of souls, and their night is falsehood. All
								truth implies and necessitates a falsehood because forms are limited, and all falsehood
								implies and necessitates a truth in the rectification of the finite by the infinite.
								All falsehood contains a certain truth which is the accuracy of its form, and for
								us all truth is enveloped in some falsehood where its semblance ends. Thus is it
								true or even probable that there exists a tremendous individual or three individuals
								in one, who is invisible and rewards those who serve him by revealing himself to
								them, is present everywhere -- even in hell -- where he tortures the damned by hiding
								himself from them, desires the salvation of all and only bestows enabling grace
								on a very small number, and imposes a terrible law on all while allowing everything
								to cast doubt on its promulgation - is there such a God? No, no, and surely no,
								the existence of God as affirmed under this form is a truth in disguise and completely
								shrouded in misconceptions. Must we accept that all things have been and all things
								will be, that eternal matter is self-sufficient, being determined in its form by
								perpetual motion, so that everything is force and matter, the soul is non-existent,
								thought is only a product of the brain and God is nothing more than the determinism
								of existence? No, indeed, for this absolute denial of intelligence would even contradict
								animal instinct. It is clear that the contrary affirmation necessitates belief in
								God. Does this God reveal Himself outside nature in a personal way to men, on whom
								He imposes ideas which are contrary to nature and reason? Of course not, because
								the fact of this revelation - if it existed - would be evident to everyone; and
								furthermore, even if the fact of an external revelation coming from an unknown being
								were an incontestable reality, if this being showed that he was in opposition to
								reason and nature which come from God, he could not be God. Moses, Mohammed, the
								Pope and the Dalai Lama each say that God has spoken to them to the exclusion of
								the others and has informed them that the others are liars. - So perhaps they are
								all liars? - No, but they deceive themselves when they act divisively and say true
								when they agree. - But has God spoken to them or has He not? God has no mouth or
								tongue to speak irr the manner of men. If He speaks it is in our consciences and
								we can always hear His voice. He it is who confirms in our hearts the words of Jesus,
								the wise words we find in Moses and the fine words we find in Mohammed. God is not
								far from every one of us, says Saint Paul, for in Him we live and move and have
								our being. Blessed are the pure in heart, says Christ, for they shall see God. Now,
								to see God, who is invisible, is to feel Him in our conscience and to hear Him speaking
								in our heart. The God of Hermes, of Pythagoras, of Orpheus, of Socrates, of Moses
								and of Jesus Christ was one and the same God and spoke to them all. Cleanthes the
								Lycon was inspired like David, and the Krishna legend is as beautiful as the Gospel
								of Saint Matthew. There are admirable pages in the Koran; but there are stupid and
								hideous things in the theology of every cult. The God of the Qabalah, of Moses and
								of Job, the God of Jesus Christ, of Origen and Synesius cannot be the God of the
								autos-da-fé. The mysteries of Christianity as understood by Saint John the Evangelist
								and the learned fathers of the Church, are sublime; but the same mysteries when
								explained, or rather rendered inexplicable by people like Garassus, Escobar and
								Veuillot, are absurd and degraded. Catholic worship is splendid or despicable according
								to the priests or churches concerned. Hence one may say with equal correctness that
								the dogma is true and is false, that God has spoken and that He has definitely not
								spoken, that the Church is infallible and that she is in a constant state of error,
								that she destroys slavery and conspires against liberty, that she elevates man and
								brutalizes him. Admirable believers can be found among atheists so-called, and atheists
								among those who profess to be believers. What is the way out of these flagrant
								contradictions?
								It is to remember that the day has its shadows and the night its brilliant lights,
								and to pick out the good which is often found in evil and to avoid the evil which
								can mingle with the good. Pope Pius IX published, under the name of the Syllabus,
								a series of propositions which he condemned, and most of them appear to be incontestably
								true from the point of view of science and reason. However, each of these propositions
								contains and conceals a false sense which is rightly condemned. Does this mean that
								we have to renounce what is, on the face of it, their true and natural meaning?
								When authority plays hide-and-seek, he who wants to do so may go looking for it;
								for our own part we shall not bother to recognize it until it shows itself. The
								intelligent bishop of Orleans, the bellicose Right Revd. Dupanloup, has proved —
								by setting the Pope's own words against one another — that the Syllabus does not,
								and indeed cannot, mean what it seems to say. If it is a word-puzzle, we, who have
								not been initiated into the profundities of the court of Rome, must beg to be excused.
								How many great truths lie hidden under dogmatic formulas which look very obscure
								or even completely ridiculous? Do my readers want examples? If one were to tell
								a Chinese philosopher that Europeans worship as the supreme God of the Universe
								a Jew who had been put to death by torture, one whom they resuscitate every day,
								so they think, in order to eat his flesh and bone under the outward appearance of
								a small wafer, would not the disciple of Confucius have some trouble in believing
								that nations which, in his eyes it is true, are barbarians but, when all is said
								and done, not total savages, could be capable of such enormities; and if one went
								on to say that this Jew was born to a woman who remained materially and physically
								virgin before and during her confinement, while a Spirit who is the same God as
								the Jew brooded over them in the form of a dove, would not his astonishment and
								scorn turn to disgust? But if, detaining him by his sleeve, one cried in his ear
								that the Jew who is God came into the world to die in torment to appease His Father,
								the God of the Jews (who found that He was not as good a Jew as they would like),
								and that the Jews' God abolished Judaism on account of His Son's death although
								He Himself had sworn it would be eternal, would he not become extremely angry? Any
								dogma, if it is to be true, must hide beneath an enigmatic form a sense which is
								eminently reasonable. It must have two faces like the divine head of the Zohar:
								one of light and the other of darkness. If the Christian doctrine as spiritually
								expounded, was not acceptable to a pious and educated Israelite, it would be necessary
								to say that this doctrine is false, and there is a simple reason for this: at the
								epoch when Christianity appeared in the world, Judaism was the true religion, and
								God Himself rejected, and had to reject everything which was not admitted by this
								religion. Therefore it is impossible for us to worship a man or anything whatever.
								We must cling, above all else, to the theism and pure spirituality of Moses. Our
								interchange of language is not a confusion of the nature of things: we worship God
								in Jesus Christ, not Jesus Christ in the place of God. We believe that God revealed
								Himself in humanity itself, that He is in us in the Spirit of the Saviour, who is
								the spirit of love, the spirit of piety, the spirit of intelligence, the spirit
								of knowledge and good counsel; and I see nothing which resembles a blind fantasy
								in all this. Our doctrines of the Incarnation, of the Trinity and of Redemption
								are as old as the world and spring even from that hidden doctrine which Mosaism
								reserved for its doctors of the law and its priests. The Tree of the Sephiroth is
								an admirable exposition of the mystery of the Trinity. The fall of Adam Kadmon,
								that gigantic conception of the whole of fallen humanity, demands a Restorer who
								is not less wonderful, the Messiah no less; and yet one who will reveal Himself
								with the meekness of a little child; able to play with the lions or call to His
								side the fledglings of the dove. Christianity, properly understood, is Judaism at
								its most perfect, minus circumcision and the rabbinic observances, and plus faith,
								hope and charity in marvellous communion. Today's students take it for granted that
								the Egyptian sages did not worship dogs or cats or vegetables. The secret doctrine
								of the initiates was precisely the same as that of Moses or Orpheus. One universal
								God, as immutable as the law, as bountiful as life, revealed in the whole of nature,
								thinking in all intelligences, loving in all hearts, the cause and principle of
								being and of beings without merging with them, invisible, and beyond all thought,
								but certainly there because nothing could exist without Him. Since they cannot see
								Him, men have dreamt of Him, and the diversity of gods is nothing more than the
								diversity of their dreams. If your dream is not like my dream, say the priests of
								different cults, you will be eternally damned. Do not reason as they do; let us
								await the hour of reveille. One could publish a fine book under a title already
								used by Michelet. It would be a harmony of the Bible, the Puranas, the Vedas, the
								books of Hermes, the Homeric Hymns, the maxims of Confucius, the Koran of Mohammed
								and even of the Scandinavian Eddas. This compilation, which would certainly be catholic,
								would be entitled to the name The Bible of Humanity; instead of doing this work,
								this rather too florid and stylish old man merely showed what could be done and
								lightly sketched the preface. In essence, religion has never changed, but every
								age and every nation has its prejudices and errors. During the first centuries of
								Christianity people were anticipating the end of the world and disdained anything
								which might add comfort to life. In the face of dreams of Heaven, the sciences,
								the arts, patriotism, love of family, all fell into oblivion. Some ran to martyrdom,
								others to the desert, and the empire collapsed in ruins. Then along came the folly
								of theological disputes, and the Christians cut one another's throats over words
								which they did not understand. In the Middle Ages, the simplicity of the Gospels
								gave place to the quibbles of the schools, and superstitions swarmed everywhere.
								At the Renaissance, materialism reappeared, the great principle of unity was disregarded
								and Protestantism sowed freakish churches in the world. The Catholics were without
								pity and the Protestants were unrelenting. Then along came gloomy Jansenism with
								its ghastly doctrines of the God who saves and damns by caprice; the cult of melancholy
								and death. After that the Revolution imposed liberty by terror, equality by the
								stroke of the axe and fraternity in bloodshed. There was a dastardly and perfidious
								reaction. Those interests which were threatened put on the mask of religion and
								the strongbox made common cause with the Cross. This is the situation as we find
								it today. The Zouaves have replaced the guardian angels of the sanctuary and the
								Kingdom of God, which suffers violence in Heaven, resists violence on earth, no
								longer with unworldliness and prayers, but with cash and bayonets. Jews and Protestants
								swell Peter's Pence. Religion is no longer a matter of faith, it is a partisan affair.
								It is evident that Christianity has not yet been understood and that at last it
								is claiming its place; this is why everything breaks down and indeed will break
								down as long as it is not established in all its truth and in all its power to settle
								the world situation into a state of balance. So the unrest we are experiencing is
								not being deliberately stirred up; it results from the perpetual motion which upsets
								everything which men try to oppose to its laws of eternal balance. The laws which
								govern the world are also sovereign over each individual human destiny: man is intended
								to be restful without being idle. His restfulness consists in knowing his proper
								state of balance; at the same time he cannot renounce perpetual motion, because
								movement is life. One must either submit to it or direct it. To submit to it is
								to be broken by it, to direct it is to be regenerated by it. There must be an
								equilibrium
								between spirit and body, not an antagonism. The insatiable thirsts of the soul can
								be as baleful as the disordered appetites of the flesh. Lust is inflamed rather
								than assuaged by senseless privations. Bodily afflictions render the soul sad and
								impotent and she is not truly queen unless the organs, her subjects, are perfectly
								unconstrained and satisfied. There is a balance and not an antagonism between grace
								and nature, for grace is the direction which God Himself has given to nature. It
								is by the grace of the Most High that the springs blossom, the summers come with
								fields of corn, and the autumns bear clusters of grapes. Why ever should we despise
								the flowers which charm our senses, the bread which sustains us, and the wine which
								invigorates us? Christ taught to pray to God to give us this day our daily bread.
								Let us also pray for the roses of each spring and the leafy shade of every summer.
								At the very least, let us ask Him for real affection in every heart, and an honest
								and sincere love for every creature. There is a balance, in which antagonism must
								never interfere, between the man and the woman. Mutual devotion is the law of union
								which binds them. The woman must captivate the man by her charm, and the man must
								emancipate the woman by his intelligence. If the woman is humiliated by the man,
								the man will be degraded by the woman. Buy a woman’s favours and she will overcharge
								and ruin you. Turn her into a creature of flesh and filth and she wi11 corrupt and
								defile you. There is a balance, and not the slightest possibility of any real
								antagonism,
								between order and liberty, between obedience and human dignity. Nobody has a right
								to arbitrary and despotic power. No, nobody, not even God. Nobody is the absolute
								master of anybody else. Even the shepherd is not the master of his dog to this extent.
								Protection is the law of the world of mind; those who must obey only obey for their
								own good; their will is guided but not subjugated; a person may enlist his will
								but never part with it. To be king is to dedicate oneself to protecting one’s royal
								rights against those of the people, and the more powerful the king is the more truly
								free the people are. For liberty without discipline and without protection is the
								worst of servitudes. It degenerates into anarchy, which is the tyranny of all in
								the conflict of factions. True social liberty is the absolutism of justice. Human
								life alternates; Turn and turn about it wakes and then drowses, immersed by sleep
								in the collective and universal life; it dreams of its persona1 existence without
								any awareness of time and space. On its return to individual and responsible life,
								it dreams in the waking state of its collective and eternal existence. A dream is
								one of those glimmers in the night. A belief in religious mysteries is one of those
								shadows which appear in the depth of the day. It is likely that, for man, eternity
								alternates like his life, being composed of periods of waking and sleeping. He dreams
								when he fancies himself to be living in the kingdom of the dead; he is awake when
								he resumes his immortality and remembers his dreams. Genesis informs us that God
								cast Adam into a deep sleep and that while the man slept He drew from him the Chavah
								to give him a helper who was like him — and Adam exclaimed: 'This is now flesh of
								my flesh and bone of my bone.' We are not forgetting that in the preceding chapter,
								the author of the sacred book has declared that Adam had been created male and female:
								clearly showing that Adam is not an isolated individual but is taken for humanity
								in its entirety. So what is this Chevah or Eve who comes out of him during his sleep
								to be his helper and who later will consecrate him to death? Surely, it is the same
								as the Maya of the Hindus, the corporeal receptacle, the terrestrial form which
								is the spirit’s helper, similar to the spirit’s own form but separated from it?
								When the spirit awakes from that earthly form, we call it death. When the spirit
								sleeps after a day spent in the universal life, it gives rise to the chavah of itself;
								It wraps itself in its chrysalis and its periods of existence in time are only like
								dreams in which it rests from its labours in eternity. Thus he ascends the ladder
								of the worlds, but only during his sleep. During his eternity he is able to enjoy
								all his fresh acquisitions of knowledge and power gained in union with Maya, whom
								he must use without becoming her slave. For Maya triumphant will throw around his
								soul a veil he cannot rend on waking, and once he has fondled that succubus he will
								be liable to wake up mad; and this is the veritable mystery of life eternal. There
								are no more pitiable creatures than the mad, and yet, for the most part, they are
								unaware of their appalling misfortune. Swedenborg went so far as to say something
								which, dangerous though it may be, is not the less touching for that in our opinion.
								He said that the damned take the horrors of hell for beauties, its darkness for
								light and its torments for pleasures. They are like those condemned to death in
								some Eastern countries, who are stupefied with narcotics before being handed over
								to the torturers. God cannot set aside the penalties attached to the violations
								of His law, but He considers that eternal death is bad enough without the addition
								of pain. Although unable to stop the furies as each draws her whip, He makes sure
								that those to be flogged are insensible. We ourselves do not agree with Swedenborg’s
								conception, because the only thing we believe in is everlasting life. His insane
								and hallucinated company of the damned, revelling in vile shadows and gathering
								poisonous toadstools in mistake for flowers, are punished for no useful reason as
								far as we can see, because they have no consciousness of their punishment. His hell,
								which would be a kind of lunatic asylum. is less noble than that of Dante: a circular
								abyss, continuously narrowing in its descent, and ending, behind the three heads
								of the symbolic serpent, in a strait way on which one need only turn round to climb
								back towards the light. Eternal life is perpetual motion and, for us, eternity has
								no other meaning than the infinity of time. Imagine for a moment that heavenly bliss
								consisted in saying Hallelujah, with palms in our hands and crowns on our heads,
								and that after five hundred million Hallelujahs we had always to start all over
								again (appalling bliss!), this would mean that a number could be assigned to each
								Hallelujah; it would have a predecessor and a successor, and succession entails
								duration, or time in other words — time, because there would be a beginning. Eternity,
								however, has neither beginning nor end. One thing is certain, and that is that we
								know absolutely nothing about the mysteries of the other life; but it is also certain
								that none of us recollects having started from nothing and that the idea of future
								non-existence imposes an equal strain on our intuition and our reason. Jesus tells
								us that the just will go to Heaven, and calls Heaven His Father's House. He assures
								us that in this House are many Mansions. We would hazard a guess that these Mansions
								are the stars. So the idea, or theory if you will, of renewed existence in the stars
								may not be altogether out of keeping with the teaching of Jesus Christ. Dream life
								is essentially different from real life; it has its scenery. its friends and its
								memories; and in that life one possesses without doubt faculties belonging to other
								forms and other worlds. One meets again loved beings whom one has never known on
								this earth; those who are dead are seen alive again; one is carried along in the
								air; one walks on water as if the action of body weight were less; one speaks unknown
								languages and makes contact with creatures who are very oddly organized. Everything
								there is reminiscent of so much that has nothing to do with this world; might these
								not be vague recollections of previous existences? Do dreams spring from the brain
								alone? Well, if the brain produces them, who invents them? Often they terrify and
								tire us. What Callot or Goya invents our nightmares? In our dreams, we frequently
								imagine we have committed crimes, and we are relieved to be free from blame when
								the hour of waking comes. Could the same thing be true of our veiled existence,
								our dreams beneath a covering of flesh? Did Nero wake up with a start and cry: ‘Praise
								God! I have not had my mother assassinated.’? Did he find her living and smiling
								beside him, ready to tell him in her turn, her imaginary crimes and evil dreams?
								Our present life often seems like a monstrous dream, and is scarcely any more rational
								than the visions of sleep. One frequently finds in it things which cannot be, and
								the things which should be there are not. It looks to us sometimes as if nature
								is acting crazily and reason is arguing with itself under a frightful Ephiast. The
								things which happen in this life of illusions and vain hopes are doubtless as foolish
								in comparison with life eternal as the visions of a dream in comparison with the
								realities of waking life. On waking, we do not blame ourselves for sins committed
								in our dreams, and, if they are crimes, society does not call us to account, if
								they have been committed while in a state of trance; as when, for example, a man
								in a trance gives his wife a mortal blow while dreaming that he is killing her.
								In some such way as this, our earthly errors may have their repercussions in Heaven
								on account of a special exaltation by which man enters eternity before he has left
								the earth. Some of the acts done in our present life can disturb the regions of
								perennial serenity. There are sins which, in the common phrase, make the angels
								weep. Such are the unjust aspersions of the saints, the calumnies to which they
								expose the Supreme Being when they represent him as the capricious despot of spirits
								and the infinite tormentor of souls. When Saint Dominic and Saint Pius V tortured
								dissident Christians, these martyred Christians having been readmitted by virtue
								of their shed blood into the great catholic assembly of Heaven, were no doubt welcomed
								into the ranks of the blessed spirits with cries of amazement and pity, and the
								terrible sleep-walkers of the inquisition would not have been excused when pleading,
								before the supreme Judge, that they had been raving in their sleep. Perverting the
								human conscience, quenching the spirit and slandering reason, persecuting the wise
								and opposing the progress of knowledge, these are the real mortal sins, sins against
								the Holy Spirit which can never be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the world
								to come.
