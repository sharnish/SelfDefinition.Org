								A universe may be defined as a group of magnetized spheres which attract and repel
								one another. The beings produced by the different spheres share their special
								magnetization
								balanced by the universal magnetism.
							</p>
							<p>
								Poorly balanced men are disordered or exaggerated magnets which nature weighs one
								against the other, until the partial error in balance has produced destruction.
							</p>
							<p>
								Bunsen's spectrum analysis will enable science to distinguish the special features
								of the magnets and thus supply a scientific reason for the ancient rules of judicial
								astrology. The different planets of the system certainly exert a magnetic effect
								on our own globe and on the various constitutions of the living creatures which
								inhabit it.
							</p>
							<p>
								We all absorb the celestial aromas mingled with the spirit of earth and born under
								the influence of diverse stars; we all have a preference for a force characterized
								by a particular form, for a certain bent and for a certain colour.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Pythoness of Delphi, seated on a tripod over a crevice in the ground, drew in
								the astral fluid through her sexual parts, fell into a state of dementia or clairvoyance
								and uttered incoherent sentences which sometimes turned out to be oracles. All
								highly-strung
								natures abandoned to disorders of the passions resemble the Pythoness and breath
								in Python, that is to say, the evil and fatal spirit of the earth. Then they forcibly
								project the fluid which has penetrated them, inspiring and absorbing immediately
								afterwards the vital fluids of other beings; thus they exercise in rotation the
								malign powers, first of the evil eye and then of the vampire.
							</p>
							<p>
								If these sick people who are suffering from this deleterious form of <i>inhaling</i>
								and <i>exhaling</i> take it for a power and wish to increase the accumulation and
								projection, they express their desires in ceremonies which are called evocations,
								and hoodoo, and become what were termed in former times necromancers and sorcerers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Every appeal to some unknown and strange intelligence, whose existence has not been
								demonstrated, with the object of substituting its guidance for that of our own reason
								and of our own free will, may be looked on as intellectual suicide, for it is an
								appeal to folly.
							</p>
							<p>
								Everything which resigns the will to mysterious forces, everything which makes other
								voices speak in us than the voices of conscience and reason, belongs to mental
								derangement.
							</p>
							<p>
								The insane are static visionaries, a waking vision is a fit of madness. The art
								of evocation is the art of provoking an artificial fit of madness in oneself.
							</p>
							<p>
								All visions have the nature of dreams and are illusions of unsound minds. They are
								clouds from a disordered imagination projected into the astral light; it is we ourselves
								who appear to ourselves disguised as phantoms, apparitions of the dead or as demons.
							</p>
							<p>
								Crazed individuals seem to make nature herself delirious, within the circle of their
								attraction and magnetic projection: the furniture makes rapping noises and moves
								about, and lightweight articles are attracted or thrown at a distance. Mental
								specialists
								are well aware of this but are afraid to admit as much, because official science
								has not yet acknowledged that human beings can be magnets and that these magnets
								can be maladjusted out of order. The abbé Vianney, parish priest of Ars, believed
								he was being continually tormented by a demon's practical jokes; and Berbiguier,
								of Terre-Neuve du Thym, armed himself with long pins for sticking into goblins.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, the point of support exists in the resistance offered to them by undisciplined
								development. What renders the organization of an army impossible in democracy is
								that each soldier fancies himself a general. There is only one general with the
								Jesuits.
							</p>
							<p>
								Obedience is the gymnastics of liberty, and before one can reach the point of doing
								always what one wants it is often necessary to learn to do what one does not want.
								What pleases us is to be in the service of fantasy; doing things we do not like
								is to exercise the reason and will and make them triumph.
							</p>
							<p>
								Contraries assert and confirm themselves by contraries. Looking left when one wants
								to go right is an act of dissembling and prudence; but to throw some weights into
								the left-hand pan of the scales to make the right-hand pan rise, is to know the
								laws of dynamics and equilibrium.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the resistance which determines the quantity of the force in dynamics; but
								there is no resistance which cannot be worn down by persistent effort and movement:
								this is how the mouse gnaws through the rope and the drops of water pierce the rock.
							</p>
							<p>
								Effort which is renewed daily builds force up and conserves it, even if the action
								is applied to something which is indifferent in itself or unreasonable and ridiculous
								into the bargain. It is hardly a serious-looking occupation to pass the beads of
								a rosary between one's fingers while repeating 'Hail Mary!' two or three hundred
								times. All the same, if a monk gets to bed without going through the rosary, he
								will wake up next day feeling very low, with no courage to offer the morning prayer
								and will be inattentive during Divine Service. Therefore the monks' confessors will
								keep reminding them, and with good reason, not to neglect the little things.
							</p>
							<p>
								The grimoires and magic rituals are full of directions which are detailed and, on
								the face of it, ridiculous:
							</p>
							<p>
								Eat your food without salt for ten or twenty days, sleep propped on your elbow,
								sacrifice a black cock at midnight at a crossroads in the middle of a forest, go
								to a graveyard and take a fistful of earth from a freshly occupied grave, etc.,
								then shroud yourself in certain bizarre vestments and pronounce long and tedious
								conjurations. Were the authors of these books trying to make fun of their readers?
								Were they imparting genuine secrets to them? No, they were not joking, and their
								imagination of their adepts and to make them conscious of a supplementary force
								which exists as soon as one believes in it and always grows stronger with persistent
								effort. Only, it can happen by the law of the reaction of contraries that the devil
								is evoked by unremitting prayer to God, and that after satanic conjurations one
								hears the angels weep. All hell danced with bells when St Anthony recited the Psalms,
								and Paradise seemed to revive again before the enchantments of Albertus Magnus or
								Merlin.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is because ceremonies in themselves mean very little, and everything depends
								on the inhaling and the exhaling. The formulas consecrated by long usage, place
								us in communication with the living and the dead, and when our will enters like
								this into the great currents it is able to arm itself with all their emanations.
								A servant-girl who practises may, at a given moment, deploy all the temporal might
								of the Church with the support of the arms of France, as was clearly shown at the
								time of the baptism and abduction of the Jew Mortara. All civilized Europe, in the
								nineteenth century protested against this act, and suffered it because a devout
								housemaid had willed it. But earth sent as auxiliaries to this girl the spectral
								emanations of the eras of Saint Dominic and Torquemada; Saint Ghislieri prayed for
								her. The shade of the great king who revoked the edict of Nantes gave her a sign
								of approbation, and the entire clerical world was ready to uphold her.
							</p>
							<p>
								Joan of Arc, who was burnt as a witch, had in fact attracted to her the spirit of
								heroic France, and poured it out in a marvellous manner to electrify its army and
								put the English to flight. A pope rehabilitated her; it was not enough, it was necessary
								to canonize her. If this thaumaturge was no sorcerer she was plainly a saint. What
								is a sorcerer anyway? Only a thaumaturge who does not meet with the pope's approval.
							</p>
							<p>
								Miracles are, if I may be allowed to say so, extravagances of nature produced by
								the excited emotions of man. They always follow the same laws. Any popular celebrity
								could work miracles, sometimes in fact without willing it. At the time when France
								idolized its kings, the French kings cured scrofula, and, in our own days the immense
								popularity of those picturesque and barbarian soldiers called zouaves has developed
								in a zouave named Jacob the faculty of healing with voice and eye. We hear that
								this zouave has left his corps to join the grenadiers, and we look on it as certain
								that the grenadier Jacob will no longer have the power which was the exclusive property
								of the zouave.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Druid times, in Gaul, there were female thaumaturges called elves and fairies.
								To the Druids they were saints; to the Christians they were sorcerers. Joseph Balsamo,
								known as the divine Cagliostro to his disciples, was condemned at Rome as a heretic
								and warlock, for having performed miracles and issued predictions without leave
								from the Ordinary. Now in this the inquisitors were correct, since the Roman Church
								held the monopoly of High Magic and effective ceremonies. She charms demons with
								water and salt; she evokes God with bread and wine to gain His visible and palpable
								presence on earth; she uses oil to bestow health and pardon.
							</p>
							<p>
								She does more: she creates priests and kings.
							</p>
							<p>
								She alone understands and reveals why the kings from the triple realm of magic,
								the three magi, led by the blazing star, came to offer to Jesus Christ in His cradle,
								the gold which fascinates the eyes and conquers men's hearts, the frankincense which
								lifts asceticism to the brain, and the myrrh which preserves dead bodies and renders
								palpable, to some extent, the doctrine of immortality by showing inviolability and
								incorruption in death.
