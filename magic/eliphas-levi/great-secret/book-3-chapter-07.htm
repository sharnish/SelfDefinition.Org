								The whole power of magic is in the central point of the universal equilibrium.
							</p>
							<p>
								The wisdom which strikes this equilibrium is contained in these four dicta: know
								the truth, will what is good, love beauty, do what is just! Because truth, goodness,
								beauty and justice are inseparable; so that he who knows the truth must needs will
								what is good, to love it because it is beautiful and to do it because it is just.
							</p>
							<p>
								The central point in the intellectual and moral order is the link between science
								and faith. In human nature this central point is the medium in which soul and body
								combine to establish the identity of their action.
							</p>
							<p>
								In physics it stands for the resultant of opposing forces compensated by one another.
							</p>
							<p>
								Understand this link, take possession of this medium, act upon this resultant!
							</p>
							<p>
								ET ERITIS SICUT DII SCIENTES BONUM ET MALUM.
							</p>
							<p>
								('And ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil').
							</p>
							<p>
								The point of balance between life and death is the great secret of immortality.
							</p>
							<p>
								The point of balance between day and night is the mainspring of the movement of
								the worlds.
							</p>
							<p>
								The balancing point between science and faith is the great secret of philosophy.
							</p>
							<p>
								The balancing point between order and liberty is the great secret of politics.
							</p>
							<p>
								The balancing point between men and woman is the great secret of love.
							</p>
							<p>
								The balancing point between will and emotion, between action and reaction is the
								great secret of power.
							</p>
							<p>
								The great secret of high magic, the inexpressible, incommunicable secret is nothing
								other than the balancing point between the relative and the absolute. It is the
								infinity of the finite and the finite of the infinite. It is the relative almightiness
								of man balancing the impossibilities of God.
							</p>
							<p>
								At this point, those who know will understand and the others will use divination
								to look for the meaning.
							</p>
							<p>
								QUI AUTEM DIVINABUNT DIVINI ERANT.
							</p>
							<p>
								('But those who are going to divine are already divine').
							</p>
							<p>
								The balancing point is the essential monad which constitutes the divinity of God,
								liberty in the individual and harmony in nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								In dynamics it is perpetual motion; in geometry it is squaring the circle; in chemistry
								it is the practical achievement of the great work.
							</p>
							<p>
								On reaching this point angels can fly without the need of wings, and men can attain
								any reasonable desire.
							</p>
							<p>
								We have just said that it is attained by the equilibrating wisdom which may be summed
								up in four words: to know, to will, to love, and to do what is true, good, beautiful
								and just.
							</p>
							<p>
								This wisdom is the vocation of all men, because God has given to all an intelligence
								with which they may know, a will with which they may resolve, a heart with which
								they may love, and a power with which they may act.
							</p>
							<p>
								The exercise of the intelligence applied to the truth leads to knowledge.
							</p>
							<p>
								The exercise of the intelligence applied to what is good gives that consciousness
								of beauty which produces faith.
							</p>
							<p>
								That which is false corrupts knowledge; that which is evil corrupts the will; that
								which is ugly corrupts love; that which is unjust cancels and perverts action. Whatever
								is true must be lovely; whatever is lovely must be true; what is good is always
								just.
							</p>
							<p>
								The evil, the false, the ugly and the unjust are incompatible with truth.
							</p>
							<p>
								I believe in religion because it is beautiful and because it teaches goodness. To
								my mind it is right to believe in it and I do not believe in the Devil because he
								is ugly and because he delivers us to evil and instructs us in the lie.
							</p>
							<p>
								If anyone talks to me of a God who misleads our intelligence, stifles our reason,
								and wishes to torture His creatures for ever, even if they are blameworthy, I regard
								this as an ugly idea, a wicked fabrication, and would consider this almighty torturer
								to be supremely unjust; and by a process of rigorous reasoning I conclude that all
								this is false, that this so-called god has been made in the image and likeness of
								the devil, and I have no wish to believe in him since I do not believe in Satan.
							</p>
							<p>
								But here I seem to be contradicting myself. The things I declare to be unjust, to
								be pieces of ugliness and in consequence falsities, follow from the teachings of
								a Church whose doctrines I profess to acknowledge and whose symbols I profess to
								respect.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yes. of course, they do follow from her teachings when misunderstood, and this is
								why we are making appeal from the face of darkness to the head of light; from the
								letter to the spirit; from the theologians to the councils; from the commentators
								to the sacred texts; and stand in readiness to submit to lawful condemnation if
								we said anything over which we should have kept silence. Let it be well understood
								that we are not writing for the profane masses, but for the instructed of a later
								age than ours and for the pontiffs of the future.
							</p>
							<p>
								Those who will prepare themselves to know the truth will also dare to will what
								is good; so they will love what is beautiful and will no longer take people like
								Veuillot as representatives of their ideals and their thoughts. From the time that
								a pope who is so inclined feels the force of doing only that which is just, he will
								no longer have to say non possumus, for he will a able to do anything hc likes and
								will once more become the monarch, not simply of Rome, but of the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								What does it matter if Peter's vessel is tossed by the tempest, has not Jesus Christ
								taught this prince of apostles how to walk on the waves? lf he sinks it is because
								he is afraid, and if he is afraid it is because hc has doubted his divine Master.
								The Saviour's hand will be stretched out, will catch hold of him and will help him
								to the shore. 'O man of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?'
							</p>
							<p>
								Can the Church ever be in danger as far as the true believer is concerned? lt is
								not the building itself which is shaky, it is the heterogeneous constructions with
								which it has been overlaid by the ignorance of the ages.
							</p>
							<p>
								A good priest told us one day of how, on visiting a Carmelite convent, he was allowed
								to see an old frock said to have belonged to the sainted founder of the order, and
								of how surprised he was to see it so filthy. The nun who showed it to him clasped
								her hands and exclaimed: 'This is the dirt of our holy mother!' The priest thought,
								as we do, that it would have been more respectful to wash the garment. The body
								dirt could not possibly be a relic, otherwise things would have to be taken to their
								logical conclusion and soon the Christians, in their stercoraceous acts of adoration,
								would no longer have any reproofs for the fetishists of the Grand Lama.
							</p>
							<p>
								What is not beautiful is not good; what is not good is not just; what is not just
								is not true.
							</p>
							<p>
								When Voltaire. that over-enthusiastic friend of justice, chanted his rallying cry
								- 'Crush the Beast!' - do you think he intended the Gospel or its adorable Author?
								Was he thinking of attacking the religion of Saint Vincent de Paul and Fénelon?
								No, of course not, he was rightly indignant at the follies, the incredible stupidities
								and the impious persecutions with which the quarrels of Jansenism and Molinism filled
								the Church of his times. For him, as us, distorted religion was an infamy, an impiety
								which is the worst of all impieties.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also, when he had done his work, when the revolution had proclaimed in accordance
								with the Gospel and in spite of the interested parties: 'liberty of conscience,
								equality before the law and the brotherhood of man', Chateaubriand made his appearance
								and showed how to the spirit religion was beautiful, and the world of Voltaire,
								having been rectified by the Revolution, was once again ready to recognize that
								religion was true.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yes, beautiful religion is true religion and ugly religion is untrue. Yes, it is
								true, the religion of Christ the consoler, of the Good Shepherd carrying the lost
								sheep on His shoulders, of the immaculate virgin, the nurse and restorer of sinners;
								it is true, the religion which adopts orphans, which embraces the criminal at the
								foot of the scaffold; which welcomes the poor as well as the rich, the servant as
								well as the master, to the table of God, and coloured men side-by-side with the
								white. It is true, the religion which orders the sovereign pontiff to be the servant
								of the servants of God, and the bishops to wash the feet of beggars!
							</p>
							<p>
								But the religion of those who trade in the sanctuary, which compels Peter's successor
								to kill in order to eat, the rancorous and commonplace religion of Veuillot, the
								religion professed by the enemies of science and progress, this is false because
								it is ugly, because it opposes itself to what is good and favours injustice. Let
								us take care not to say that these mutually contradictory religions are the same.
								It would be like saying that polished iron or dross are silver or gold and that
								leprosy is the same thing as normal skin.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is a need for religion in man: it is an incontestable fact which science is
								compelled to recognize; this need is felt by a special inner sense: the sense of
								eternity and infinity. Some emotions when once experienced are never forgotten:
								those of devotion.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Brahmin discovers them when lost in the contemplation of Iswara; the Israelite
								is possessed by them in the presence of Adonai; the devout Catholic nun sheds tears
								of love on the feet of her crucifix. Do not try to tell them these are illusions
								and lies: they would give you a pitying smile, and rightly so. Each of them has
								been filled with beams of light from the Eternal Thought. They behold it; and the
								feelings they must experience in the presence of those who deny are the feelings
								of sighted people who hear a blind man deny the existence of the sun.
							</p>
							<p>
								So faith has its own evidence. Now here we have a truth the knowledge of which is
								indispensable: a man without faith is incomplete; he lacks the first of all the
								interior senses. Morals will be limited for him of necessity and will amount to
								very little. It is possible for morals to be independent of this or that dogma,
								of the prescriptions of this or that priest; but they cannot exist without the religious
								sentiment, because without that sentiment human dignity becomes a matter of dispute
								or quite arbitrary. Lacking God and the immortality of the soul, what is the best,
								the most loving and the most faithful of men? He is a talking dog; and many will
								find the morals of the wolf prouder and more independent than those of the dog.
								We have only to refer to La Fontaine's fable.
							</p>
							<p>
								True independent morals are those of the Good Samaritan, who tended the wounds of
								the Jew in spite of the religious hatred between Jerusalem and Samaria; they are
								those of Abd-el-Kadir risking his life to save the Christians of Damascus. Alas,
								venerable Pius IX, that you, Holy Father, were not able to risk yours to save those
								of Perugia, of Castelfidardo and of Mentana!
							</p>
							<p>
								It was Jesus Christ who said, in speaking of the priests of His own times: 'Do what
								they say, but do not do as they do.' And then the priests said that Jesus Christ
								must be crucified - and crucifed He was! The priests, however shameful their works
								may have been, were infallible in their words.
							</p>
							<p>
								On the other hand, did not the same Jesus Christ heal the sick on the Sabbath day,
								scandalizing the Pharisees and the doctors of the law?
							</p>
							<p>
								True independent morals are those which are inspired by independent religion.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, this independent religion must be a manly one: the other sort is only good
								for children.
							</p>
							<p>
								We could not have, in religion, a more perfect example than Jesus Christ. Jesus
								practised the Mosaic religion, but was not its slave. The law, He said, was made
								for man, not man for the law; He was rejected by the synagogues and spent little
								time in the temple; He took the side of the spirit against the letter on every question;
								unselfish love was all He enjoined on His disciples. His dying moments were spent
								in giving absolution to a penitent sinner and in commending His mother to the care
								of His beloved disciple, and the priests only assisted at His last hour in order
								to curse Him.
							</p>
							<p>
								The point of balance in religion is the most absolute liberty of conscience and
								voluntary obedience to the authority which regulates public instruction, discipline
								and worship.
							</p>
							<p>
								In politics, this point of balance is that despotism of the law which guarantees
								the liberty of all men within the most perfect hierarchic system.
							</p>
							<p>
								In dynamics it is the central balance of a system.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the Qabalah it is the marriage of the Elohim.
							</p>
							<p>
								In magic it is the central point between resistance and action; it is the simultaneous
								employment of the ob and the od to create the aour.
							</p>
							<p>
								In alchemy it is the indissoluble union of mercury and sulphur.
							</p>
							<p>
								In all things it is the alliance of the true, the good, the beautiful and the just.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the proportionate measure of existence and life, it is eternity in time, and
								the power which generates time within eternity.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the part of the whole and the whole of the part.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the idealism of man meeting the realism of God.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the connection between the beginning and the end, and exhibits both the Omega
								of the Alpha and the Alpha of the Omega.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, it is what the high initiates have designated by the mysterious name Azoth.
