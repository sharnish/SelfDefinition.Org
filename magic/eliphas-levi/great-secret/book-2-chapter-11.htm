							<p>
								You must look in Solomon's tomb, that is to say, in the crypts of occult philosophy,
								not for his ring but for his wisdom.
							</p>
							<p>
								Assisted by wisdom and a persistent will, you will attain wisdom's supreme secret,
								which is free sovereignty over balanced movement. You will then be able to get the
								ring for yourself by having it made by a goldsmith, to whom you will have no occasion
								to reveal the secret. For if he does not know what he is making he will not be able
								to tell others.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here is the formula for the ring:
							</p>
							<p>
								Take a small quantity of gold and twice the amount of silver at the hours of the
								sun and the moon, and mix them together; add three parts similar to the first of
								well refined copper, four parts of tin, five of iron, six of mercury and seven of
								lead. Mix them all together at the hours corresponding to the metals, and make the
								whole into a ring with the circular part flattened and slightly broad, permitting
								characters to be engraved on it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Make a square setting in this ring to hold a red lodestone mounted in a double ring
								of gold.
							</p>
							<p>
								Engrave the double seal of Solomon on the stone, above and below.
							</p>
							<p>
								Engrave the ring with the occult signs of the seven planets as illustrated in the
								magical Archidoxis of Paracelsus or in Agrippa's Occult Philosophy; magnetize the
								ring strongly by consecrating it every day for a week with the ceremonies appointed
								in our ritual.
							</p>
							<p>
								The ring must then be wrapped in a silk fabric and, after fumigation, may be carried
								on your person.
							</p>
							<p>
								A round piece of metal or a talisman prepared in the same manner would have as much
								virtue as the ring.
							</p>
							<p>
								Anything prepared like this is a sort of reservoir of the will. It is a magnetic
								reflector which can prove very useful, although it is never essential.
							</p>
							<p>
								We have stated elsewhere that the ancient rites have lost their efficacy since the
								advent of Christianity.
							</p>
							<p>
								Catholic Christianity is in fact the legitimate daughter of Jesus, whom the magi
								adored. Catholic worship is nothing other than high magic referred to the laws of
								the hierarchy, which are indispensable to ensure that it is both reasonable and
								efficacious.
							</p>
							<p>
								An ordinary scapular, worn by a true Christian, is a more invincible talisman than
								the ring and the pentacle of Solomon.
							</p>
							<p>
								Jesus Christ, Son of God and Son of Man, so humble, said of Himself: 'The Queen
								of Sheba came from the distant East to see and listen to Solomon, and a greater
								than Solomon is here.'
							</p>
							<p>
								The Mass is the most prodigious of evocations.
							</p>
							<p>
								Necromancers evoke the dead, sorcerers evoke the devil and tremble, but the Catholic
								priest does not tremble to evoke the Living God!
							</p>
							<p>
								What are all the talismans of ancient science in comparison with the consecrated
								wafer?
							</p>
							<p>
								Let Solomon's skeleton sleep on in its tomb of rock, together with the ring he may
								have on his bony finger. Jesus Christ has risen from the dead, He lives. Take one
								of those silver rings as sold at the church porch, stamped with the image of the
								crucified and with ten rosary beads. If you are worthy to wear it, it will be more
								effective in your hands than the genuine ring of Solomon would be.
							</p>
							<p>
								Magical rituals and detailed performances in worship are all for the ignorant and
								superstitious, and we cannot help recalling the well-known story which we shall
								now relate briefly, because it fits in here.
							</p>
							<p>
								Two monks entered a thatched cottage which had been left in the care of two children,
								and asked to be allowed to rest and to have something to eat if that were possible.
								The children replied that they had nothing to give.
							</p>
							<p>
								-- 'Ah well!' said one of the monks, 'here's a fire; just lend us a pot and a little
								water and we'll make ourselves some soup.'
							</p>
							<p>
								'With what?'
							</p>
							<p>
								'With this pebble', said the cunning friar, fetching a piece of stone. 'Don't you
								know, my children, that the disciples of St Francis possess the secret of pebble
								soup?'
							</p>
							<p>
								Pebble soup? What a marvel for the children! They were promised that they would
								taste it and find it excellent.
							</p>
							<p>
								Within the space of a few minutes the pot was got ready, the water was poured into
								it, the fire was stirred into a blaze, and the pebble was carefully placed in the
								water.
							</p>
							<p>
								'So far so good,' said the monks, 'and now a little salt and some vegetables; bring
								them, there are some in your garden. Now, why not add a little smoked bacon? It
								will only improve the soup.
							</p>
							<p>
								The children squatted by the hearth looking on in wonder. The pot boiled.
							</p>
							<p>
								'Right, cut a few slices of bread and come to this tureen. My! What a smell! Lay
								the table, and let's dip our bread in the soup. Here's the pebble, wrap it up carefully,
								you may keep it for your trouble; it will never be used up and will always work.
								Now then, taste the soup! There! What did we tell you?'
							</p>
							<p>
								'Oh! It's first rate!' said the little peasant children, clapping their hands.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact it was a good bacon and cabbage soup, which the children would never have
								managed to set before their guests without the bit of wonder-working with the pebble.
							</p>
							<p>
								Magical rituals and religious ceremonies are rather like the monks' pebble. They
								supply the pretext and the occasion for practising virtues which, in themselves,
								are indispensable to the moral life of man. The good monks would not have dined
								without the pebble; so did some real power reside in the stone? Yes, in the imagination
								of the youngsters, which was set working by the ingenuity of the good fathers.
							</p>
							<p>
								We can say this without blaming or offending anyone. The monks were sensible men,
								not liars. They helped the children to do good, and filled them with admiration,
								helping them to share a good soup; and in this connection we advise those who are
								feeling hungry but would find it rather too difficult (or rather too simple) to
								make cabbage soup, to make pebble soup instead.
							</p>
							<p>
								We want to be clearly understood on this point. We are not trying to say that signs
								and rites are a big piece of humbug. They would be such if people did not need them;
								but we have to recognize that everyone has not the same degree of intelligence.
								Children have always had fairy stories told to them, and these stories will continue
								to be told as long as there are nurses and mothers. Children have faith and this
								is what saves them. Imagine a child of seven saying: 'I do not want to accept anything
								I cannot understand.' What could one teach such a monster? Accept what your teachers
								tell you to begin with, my fine fellow, then study it and, if you are not an idiot,
								you will understand it by-and-by.
							</p>
							<p>
								Children need fables, the masses need fables and ceremonies; the frailty of mankind
								needs crutches. Blessed are those who possess the ring of Solomon, but even more
								blessed are those who equal or surpass Solomon in knowledge and wisdom without requiring
								his ring!
