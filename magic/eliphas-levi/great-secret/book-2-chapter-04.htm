							<p>
								The movement of the serpents around the caduceus indicates the formation of a chain.
							</p>
							<p>
								This chain exists in two forms: the straight form and the circular form. Starting
								from the same centre it intersects innumerable circumferences by innumerable radii.
								The straight chain is the chain of transmission. The circular chain is the chain
								of participation, of diffusion, of communion, of religion. In this manner is formed
								that wheel, made up of several wheels turning one within another, which flashes
								on us from the vision of Ezekiel. The chain of transmission introduces solidarity
								between successive generations.
							</p>
							<p>
								The central point is white on one side and black on the other.
							</p>
							<p>
								The black serpent is fastened to the black side, and the white serpent is fastened
								to the white side. The central point represents original free will, and on its black
								side begins the original sin.
							</p>
							<p>
								The current of fate starts from the black side, whereas choice of movement is attached
								to the white side. The central point may be allegorically represented by the moon,
								and the two forces by two women, one of them white and the other black.
							</p>
							<p>
								The black woman is fallen Eve, she is the passive form, the infernal Hecate who
								bears the lunar crescent on her forehead. The white woman is Maia or Maria who treads
								under foot both the crescent moon and the head of the black serpent.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is impossible to express the matter more clearly, because we have rested our
								hand on the cradle of all the dogmas. They have reverted to infancy before our very
								eyes, and we are wary lest we should harm them.
							</p>
							<p>
								The doctrine of original sin, in whatever fashion it may be interpreted, assumes
								the pre-existence of our souls, if not in their own special life, at least in the
								universal life.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, if one can sin without knowing it in the universal life, one must needs be
								saved in the same way; but this is a great mystery.
							</p>
							<p>
								The straight chain, the spoke of the wheel, the chain of transmission, produces
								solidarity between the generations, ensuring that the fathers are punished in their
								children so that, by the sufferings of the children the fathers stand a chance of
								being saved.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Scriptures tell us that Christ descended into Hell and, having broken the iron
								locks and the doors of brass, ascended into Heaven leading captivity captive.
							</p>
							<p>
								And the Universal Life cried out: Hosanna! For He has removed the sting of Death!
							</p>
							<p>
								What is meant by all this? Dare one explain it? Will you be able to guess or understand
								it?
							</p>
							<p>
								The ancient hierophants of Greece had another way of representing the two forces
								illustrated by the two serpents; this was as two children struggling with one another
								while holding a globe between their feet and knees.
							</p>
							<p>
								The two children are Eros and Anteros, Cupid and Hermes, foolish love and wise love;
								and their everlasting fight keeps the world in equilibrium.
							</p>
							<p>
								If one does not agree that we may have had some personal existence before our birth
								on earth, original sin will have to be seen as a voluntary depravity of human magnetism
								in our first parents, who would have broken the equilibrium of the chain by allowing
								a deadly predominance to the black serpent, that is to say, the astral current of
								the dead life; and we are suffering the consequences like children who are born
								with rickets owning to their parents' vices; feeling the penalty of misdoings which
								they did not commit themselves.
							</p>
							<p>
								The extreme sufferings of Jesus and the martyrs, the excessive penances of the saints,
								were intended as a counterpoise to this lack of equilibrium; so irreparable, it
								must be added, that the world will one day be burnt up. Grace would be typified
								by the dove and the lamb; the astral current of life charged with the merits of
								the Redeemer or the saints.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Devil or Tempter would be the astral current of death; the black serpent stained
								with all the crimes of men, scaled with their evil thoughts, loaded with the poison
								of their sinful desires; in other words THE MAGNETISM OF EVIL.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now then, between good and evil an unending conflict is waged. They are irreconcilable
								for ever. So evil is always damned, always condemned to the torments which go with
								disorder, and yet, from our childhood it never ceases to entice us and to attract
								us to its side. Everything which mystical poetry teaches us about king Satan is
								perfectly explained in terms of this appalling magnetism which is so much the more
								terrible as it is more fatal; yet need not be feared so much by virtue, which it
								cannot overtake and which, by God's grace will surely resist it.
