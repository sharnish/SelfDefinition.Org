								A vague feeling which could be termed a sense of the infinite activates and torments
								mankind. Man feels dormant forces lying inside him, and thinks he can detect the
								presence of amorphous foes and unknown helpers. Many times he needs to believe in
								the absurd and attempt the impossible. Perhaps he feels low and discouraged, baffled
								at every turn, and longing to twist his despair into the shape of some new hope.
								He has been deceived in love, his friends have deserted him, and reason is not enough
								to meet his case. A philosopher would depress him; a magician would scare him; so
								at this juncture he betakes himself to a priest!
							</p>
							<p>
								The priest is the tamer of imaginary hippogryphs and monsters hatched by fantasy.
								He draws a force from our weaknesses and constructs a reality out of our chimeras:
								he is the homoeopathic doctor for human folly. Besides, is he not something more
								than a mere man? Is not his mission a legitimate one, nobly descended from Calvary
								or Sinai? I am referring to the Catholic priest now, and as a matter of fact he
								is the only one that exists. The Jews have their rabbis, the Moslems their imams,
								the Hindus their brahmins, the Chinese their bonzes, and the Protestants their
								ministers.
								Only the Catholics have priests, because only they have the altar and the sacrifice,
								that is to say, the sum total of religion.
							</p>
							<p>
								To perform high magic is to set oneself up as a rival to the Catholic priesthood;
								to be a non-conformist priest in fact. Rome is the grand Thebes of the new initiation.
								In former times she raked up the bones of her martyrs to fight against the gods
								evoked by Julian. Her catacombs are her crypts, her rosaries and medals are her
								talismans, her congregations are her magic chains, her magnetic sources are her
								convents, her centres of attraction are her confessionals. As means of expansion
								she has her sees, her printing presses and the pastoral letters of her bishops.
								Finally, she has her pope, the 'god-man' made visible and permanent on earth; her
								pope, who may be a fool as nearly all fanatics are, more or less, or a scoundrel
								like Alexander VI, who for all that will be the governor of spirits, the arbiter
								of conscience, and the legitimate bestower of indulgences and pardons throughout
								the Christian world.
							</p>
							<p>
								That is ridiculous, you will say! - Yes, it borders on the ridiculous because of
								its magnitude! It borders on the ridiculous because it goes beyond the sublime!
								What comparable power has ever appeared on this earth; and if it did not exist,
								who would ever dare to invent it? What is the origin of this prodigy which seems
								to achieve the impossible? - It comes from the concentration of vagrant forces,
								from giving a direction to vague instincts, from the conventional creation of the
								absolute in the spheres of hope and faith!
							</p>
							<p>
								Go on, yell at the monster, you philosophers of the eighteenth century! The monster
								is stronger than you are and will vanquish you. Go on, say you must crush the shameful
								thing, you disciples of Voltaire! But what shameful thing are you talking about?
								Is it the inspiring infamy of Vincent de Paul and Fénelon, the infamy which suggests
								so many sacrifices to the noble sisters of charity, so much devotion to the poor
								and chaste missionaries? A shameful thing is it, which has founded so many charitable
								institutions, so many refuges for the penitent, so many retreats for the innocent?
								If that is infamy, and if your slanders and insults are held in honour, then I embrace
								the pillory with all my heart and trample on your honour!
							</p>
							<p>
								However, this was not what you were trying to say, and I will not calumniate you
								in my turn. Soul of Voltaire, you whom I willingly call a saintly soul, for you
								preferred truth and justice above all else - to you good sense was God and folly
								was the Devil. You only saw an ass at the cradle of Bethlehem. You saw the triumphal
								entry of Jesus into Jerusalem and you made fun of the ass's ears. This must have
								angered Fréron. Ah, if only you had lived to meet Veuillot! But we must be serious,
								for these are serious matters.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Genius of Christianity<sup class="black">*</sup> has made its reply to the sarcasms of Voltaire, or rather
								Chateaubriand has completed Voltaire, for these two great men stand equally outside
								the Catholicism of the priests.
							</p>

							<p class="note80">
								* Le Génie du Chritianisme, written by Chateaubriand in 1802
							</p>
							<p>
								The ass's ears are going to be indispensable as long as there are asses in the world;
								and asses there will be, for nature, the daughter of God, has placed them there.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was the will of Jesus Christ to have an ass as His mount, and this is why the
								Holy Father rides on a mule. Even his slipper is called a mule; to indicate, perhaps,
								that a good pope should be stubborn to the very nails on his toes. Non possumus,
								replied our Holy Father, Pope Pius X, when he was asked for concessions and reforms.
								The pope never says possumus, 'We are able', since this is the great arcanum of
								the priesthood; all the priests are well aware of it, but it is truest of all when
								they refrain from saying it.
							</p>
							<p>
								The power which is founded on the mysteries must be a mysterious power, otherwise
								it would no longer exist.
							</p>
							<p>
								I believe that this man can do something which I am unable to define because of
								something else which I do not understand any more than he does. Thus I am obliged
								to obey him, because I should be unable to say why I should not obey him, not being
								able to deny the existence of what I do not know, the existence, moreover, which
								he affirms with quite as much reason. I feel it is irrational and am happy about
								it, because he tells me repeatedly that reason is not to be trusted. I simply find
								that this gives me a sense of comfort, and that I am tranquillized by this mode
								of thought.
							</p>
							<p>
								- Charbonnier, you are right.
							</p>
							<p>
								Abortive or disappointing love affairs, frustrated ambitions, impotent fits of anger,
								embittered resentments, pride which goes before a fall, a laziness of mind which
								tires of doubt, the leap of ignorance into the unknown especially when it is marvellous,
								vague fears of death, the pangs of a bad conscience, the need for a repose which
								constantly evades us, the sombre and grandiose dreams of artists, dread visions
								of eternity: these are the forces which religion gathers together and of which she
								forms the most invincible and most formidable passion of all - devotion.
							</p>
							<p>
								This passion is unbridled, for nothing can restrain or limit it. It glories in its
								excesses, and believes that it has taken the first step into Eternity. It absorbs
								all the sentiments of a man, and renders him insensible to all else; and pushes
								its zeal for propaganda to the most murderous extremes of despotism and the most
								implacable fury. Saint Dominic and Saint Pius V are acknowledged as such by the
								whole Church, and cannot be disowned by a devout and faithful Catholic.
							</p>
							<p>
								One can understand how devotion may become a powerful lever in the hand of an authority
								which declares that it is infallible. 'Give me a place to stand outside the world',
								declared Archimedes, 'and I will move the earth.' The priests have found such a
								place where they can exert their pressure, beyond the pale of personal reason, and
								they have displaced the reason of mankind.
							</p>
							<p>
								'Seeing that men have not attained the knowledge of God by knowledge and by reason,
								it has pleased us' said the Prince of Apostles, 'to save the believers by the
								foolishness
								of the faith!'
							</p>
							<p>
								What have you to answer to this, those of you who are adversaries of the Church?
								Saint Paul speaks perfectly plainly here, without trying to deceive anybody.
							</p>
							<p>
								The religious force of the dogma is in this obscurity which makes its absurdity
								apparent. Once a dogma has been explained, it is no longer a dogma, but a theorem
								in philosophy, or at least a postulate. People are always wanting to confuse religion
								with philosophy, and fail to understand that their separation and distinctiveness,
								I shall not say their antagonism, are absolutely essential to the equilibrium of
								reason.
							</p>
							<p>
								Astronomers think that comets follow paths which are only relatively aberrant as
								far as our own system is concerned, and that they take a regular course from one
								system to another by describing an ellipse of which the foci are two suns.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the same for man's aberrant forces. A single light is insufficient for him,
								and to balance his progress, he needs two centres and two foci: the one is reason,
								and the other is faith.
