								For the priest to be powerful, he must know or he must believe. The reconciliation
								of science with faith is the province of the great hierophant.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the priest knows without believing, he may be either a man of good will or a
								dishonest man. If he is a man of good will, he exploits the faith of others in the
								interests of reason and justice. If he is dishonest, he exploits their faith in
								the interests of his own greed, but then he is a priest no longer, he is the vilest
								of criminals.
							</p>
							<p>
								If he believes without knowing, he is a respectable but dangerous dupe, who will
								be dominated and kept in check by the men of science.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Christendom, priesthood and royalty are only delegations. We are all priests
								and kings; but since the priestly and royal functions imply the action of one man
								upon a multitude, we entrust our powers to a king in the temporal order, and to
								a priest in the spiritual order.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Christian King is as much a priest as the rest of us, but he may not exercise
								his priestly office.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Christian priest is a king like us, but he may not wield royal authority.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the priest's duty to guide the king, and the king's duty is to protect the
								priest.
							</p>
							<p>
								The priest holds the keys and the king bears the sword. Saint Peter was the priest
								of early Christianity, and its king was Saint Paul.
							</p>
							<p>
								The king and the priest hold their powers from the people as a whole, who had been
								consecrated king and priest by the holy unction of baptism and the application of
								the divine blood of Jesus Christ.
							</p>
							<p>
								All society is safeguarded by the balance between these two powers.
							</p>
							<p>
								If there were no pope tomorrow, there would be no king on the day after, and no
								person to reign either in the temporal or in the spiritual order, because no-one
								would obey any more; then there would be no more society and men would slaughter
								one another.
							</p>
							<p>
								The pope is the priest and the priest is the pope, because the one is the representative
								of the other. The authority of the pope comes from the priests, and that of the
								priests re-ascends to the pope. Beyond that there is only God. Such, at least, is
								the belief of the priests.
							</p>
							<p>
								Hence the priest disposes of divine power through those who have trust in him. I
								will even dare to suggest that his power has the appearance of being more than divine,
								because he purports to command God, and create Him at a word! Owing to the prestige
								attached to his person, he strips men of their pride and women of their modesty.
								He compels them to come and recount depravities which men would hate to be suspected
								of, and women would refuse to listen to outside the confessional. But once they
								are there it is all right to come out with their petty acts of shame, told in a
								low voice, and the priest pardons them or imposes a penance on them: a few prayers
								to say, some mortification to suffer, and they go away consoled. Is a little servitude
								too dear a price to pay for peace of heart?
							</p>
							<p>
								Seeing that religion is a spiritual medicine, servitude is as certainly involved
								as when the doctor prescribes his remedies and submits the invalids in his care
								to a régime. Nobody could reasonably dispute the usefulness of medicine, but this
								does not justify doctors in forcing the healthy to dose and purge themselves.
							</p>
							<p>
								It would be an amusing sight to see the president of the French Academy publish
								an encyclical against all those who live without laxatives, and lay under a ban
								those who live without laxatives, and lay under a ban those who try to do without
								the doctor by dint of sobriety and plenty of exercise. But the scene would change
								from comedy to tragedy without a hint of humour, if the government, adopting the
								pretensions of dean, gave the recalcitrants a straight choice between the hypodermic
								syringe and the firing squad. The liberty of the régime is as inviolable as liberty
								of conscience.
							</p>
							<p>
								You will say to me, perhaps, that one does not ask the mentally ill for their opinion
								before giving them cold showers. I agree, but take care: this argument could be
								turned against you. Those who are mad are opposed to common sense. They entertain
								exceptional beliefs and extravagant notions which they want to impose on others
								and which drive them frantic. Do not try to make us believe that the proper way
								to answer the defenders of the Syllabus<sup class="black">*</sup> is with obligatory cold showers.
							</p>
							<p class="note80">
								* Probably the Syllabus of contemporary views set out and condemned
								by Pius IX in 1864.
							</p>
							<p>
								The authority of the priest is entirely moral and cannot be imposed by force. But
								on the other hand, and as a fair compensation, force is unable to destroy his authority.
								If you kill a priest you make a martyr. Making a martyr is equivalent to laying
								the first stone of an altar, and every altar produces its seminaries of priests.
								If you knock an altar down, twenty more will be built from the scattered stones
								which you will not demolish a second time. Religion is no human invention, it is
								inevitable, that is to say providential; it comes into being of its own accord to
								satisfy a human need, and that is why God has willed it and revealed it.
							</p>
							<p>
								The man in the street believes in it because it is incomprehensible to him, and
								apparently it is sufficiently irrational to appeal to him and win his allegiance.
								As for me, I believe in it because I understand it and because I should think it
								absurd not to believe in it.
							</p>
							<p>
								'It is I, be not afraid,' said Christ, as he walked on the waves at the height of
								the storm.
							</p>
							<p>
								'Lord, if it be thou,' said Saint Peter, 'bid me to come to you, also walking on
								the waves.'
							</p>
							<p>
								'Come!' replied the Saviour, and Saint Peter walked on the sea. Suddenly the wind
								blew more furiously, the rollers rose and fell, and the man was afraid; immediately
								he began to sink, and Jesus, catching hold of him and holding him up with His hand,
								said to him: 'O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?'
