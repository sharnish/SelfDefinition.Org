								Those whom initiates are entitled to call profane, the vile multitude, that is to
								say the feeble serious matter of an apple) in a fit of anger, has been obliged to
								suffer unending death to ransom them eternally and securely. If you mention the
								Qabalah to them they invariably visualize it as a coded grimoire which is used to
								summon the Devil and to rule the fantasy world of sylphs, gnomes, salamanders and
								undines. If the conversation turns to magic, they think of it in terms of Circe's
								wand and enchanted cup which changes men into swine. They easily confuse Zoroaster
								with Muhammad and, as for Hermes Trismegistus, they think that that is some strange
								name used to mystify the ignorant, just as the word ‘Bogy-man' is used to intimidate
								children. Ignorance, like faith, has its orthodoxy; and if one happens to know things
								which are unknown to the so-called learned, one is a heretic in their eyes. Because
								there are no new truths, the wise men of this world support their authority on tottering
								error. Besides, it is well known that accepted error props up almost every standpoint.
								‘How dare you answer the High Priest like that!' shouts an officer as he strikes
								Jesus who has spoken with respectful firmness. ‘Are you trying to say, you nobody,
								that when the authorities accuse you they expose their own ignorance? Are you telling
								us that you know something unknown to the powers-that-be? So the High Priest is
								wrong is he, and you know he is wrong? He is talking nonsense and you are talking
								sense?' Napoleon I detested ideologies because he himself was the world's leading
								ideologist. He wanted to carry all before him without resistance, but was unable
								to offer any resistance when the striking power he had deployed for so long was
								suddenly turned against him. Since the dawn of history, we see that it is always
								the lie which has ruled the earth, while truth has asserted its rule from time to
								time in violent disasters and plagues. Cruel and inflexible Truth! Is it surprising
								that men do not like you? Time and again you destroy the illusions of kings and
								commoners and if, on occasions, you have your devoted servants, you abandon them
								and turn them over to the cross, the stake and the scaffold! Blessed are those who
								die for you, but wiser are those who serve you with sufficient adroitness to avoid
								a useless martyrdom. There is no doubt that Rabelais was a greater philosopher than
								Socrates, since by hiding behind the mask of Aristophanes he managed to escape the
								attentions of the breed of Anitus and Melitus (who are always with us). Galileo,
								whose name in itself would make the Holy Inquisition a laughing-stock for all time,
								had sense enough not to brave the torture chamber and the dungeon. Contemporary
								documents show him as a prisoner in a palace drinking with the inquisitors and signing
								<i>inter pocula</i> (between drinks) his ironic deed of abjuration, far from saying
								with a stamp of his foot and a clenched fist, '<i>Eppur si muove</i>' ('It does
								move, all the same'). It is said that he added, 'Yes, I affirm on your word that
								the earth is immobile, and if you like I will add that the heavens are made of glass,
								and if it pleased God that your foreheads were the same they would let in the light'.
								Rabelais would have turned and said, 'Let's drink on that!' Would it not be the
								most ridiculous form of suicide to die in order to prove to fools that two and two
								make four? A theorem which has been demonstrated cannot be denied, and the abjuration
								of a mathematical truth is nothing more than a farce and a grimace, the absurdity
								of which will attach itself to those who can seriously exact it in the name of an
								alleged infallible authority. If Galileo had gone to the stake for protesting against
								the Church, he would have been a heresiarch. By abjuring as a Catholic what he had
								demonstrated as a scientist, he killed the Catholicism of the Middle Ages. One day
								someone handed the author of this book an article from the <i>Syllabus saying</i>,
								'Take a look, here is the formal condemnation of your doctrines. If you are a Catholic,
								admit the charge and burn your books; if, on the other hand, you are going to ersist
								in your teachings, don't let's hear any more about your catholicity. The article
								from the <i>Syllabus</i> is number seven in Section Two and the doctrines it condemns
								are these: 'The prophecy and miracles made known and recorded in Scripture are poetic
								fictions and the mysteries of the Christian faith are an epitome of philosophic
								investigations; contained in the books of the two Testaments are mystical inventions
								and Jesus Himself is a myth.' What was the astonishment of the person who was trying
								to confound me when I said that these were no doctrines of mine. I said to him,
								'Here is what I teach or, rather what is recognized by the Church, by science and
								by myself.' 'The narratives of the prophecies and miracles in the Bible have a poetic
								form which is peculiar to the oriental genius. The mysteries of the Christian faith
								have been confirmed and explained, as to their expression, by philosophic
								investigations.
								The Old and New Testaments contain parables and Jesus Himself has been the subject
								of many parables and legends.' I fearlessly submit these propositions to the Pope
								and to the future Council, and am quite certain in advance that they will not condemn
								them. What the Church does not want, and rightly so, is to be deliberately contradicted.
								Her infallibility is needed to maintain peace in the Christian world, so she must
								preserve her infallibility at all costs. If she were to say that two and two make
								three, I should take care not to say she was mistaken. I should endeavour to find
								how and in what manner two and two could make three, and you may be sure I would
								be successful. For example: two apples and two halves of an apple make three apples.
								When the Church seems to utter an absurdity, it is merely an enigma propounded to
								test the faith of the faithful. Needless to say, it will be a grand and moving
								spectacle,
								this next General Council, when the queen of the Old World, wrapped in her tattered
								purple, declares that she is more sovereign than ever at the moment she falls from
								her throne, and proclaims her extended tights and new pretensions in the face of
								imminent spoliation. The bishops will be as heroic as those sailors of the Vengeur
								who, on a ship ready to founder, were full of defiance instead of surrendering and
								fired their last broadside as they nailed their flag to the remaining stump of the
								mainmast. Besides, they know that a compromise would utterly ruin them and that
								the altar flames would go out as soon as they ceased to be in darkness. When the
								temple veil is rent the gods depart, to return when new dogmatic embroidery makes
								a new veil lightproof. Night is for ever backing away from the advance of day, but
								only to take possession of regions on the other side of the globe which the sun
								has abandoned. There is need of darkness, there is need of impenetrable mysteries
								to baffle that dark intelligence which believes in the absurd and combines the despotism
								of a limited reasoning power with the immeasurable audacity of faith. Daylight
								circumscribes
								our horizons and gives us a sight of the limits of the world; it is night, more
								than anything else, boundless night with its immense haze of stars, which gives
								rise to our sense of the infinite. Church proclaimed at Nicaea a unity of substance
								analogous to the unity of God. When an attempt was made to represent Jesus Christ
								as a hybrid personage composed theological puzzle. The Immaculate Conception of
								the Virgin is not a question of embryology and the table of logarithms has nothing
								to do with the There is a white god and a black god in the Qabalah of Rabbi Simeon
								Ben Jochai.
