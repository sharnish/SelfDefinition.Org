								<p> [99:2. It is at least questionable whether this be not the best, wisest, and safest position. Admitting that by a devotion to Occult Physics, two supreme gifts are attainable,&mdash;one, the preservation of the individual memory right through all the further lives on this and the other planets of our cycle, throughout a complete circuit-in other words the quasi-immortalisation of the personality; and second, the power of controlling and directing our own future after death instead of being drawn into the vortex and being there disposed of while still in a passive state under the laws of affinities; yet it is at any rate questionable whether even these, the highest gifts, which not one per cent of adepts even attain to, really profit a man in the long run. Most certainly to attain them, an utterly self-regarding life is needed in the case of men of our race. A sublime selfishness it may be, but none the less selfishness, is essential to the attainment of these highest gifts. It is at least open to doubt whether an active life of unselfishness and benevolence amongst our fellows is not more conducive to happiness in the long run. In a universe governed by a mathematical justice, we may be content to leave our future in the hands of the Eternal Laws and the immortalisation of a necessarily imperfect <em>personality</em> is a doubtful good. As for all other powers dependent on a manipulation of the Astral Essence, though doubtless susceptible of beneficial exercise on rare occasions, they hardly appear to me aims worthy of the Man-Divine. </p> <!-- note 99:2 continues on p. 100 -->
								<p> A certain theoretical knowledge of the Physics of Occultism grows in the mind in its progress in the Metaphysics of the "Highest Science," but in my humble notion it is to a thorough comprehension and grasp of these latter that our best efforts should be directed. We should not waste time, seeking powers or power; we should lift no longing gaze even to the two supreme accomplishments, but we should strive so to purify our <em>natures</em> and permeate ourselves with an active love for the ALL, as to ensure at the recast, the evolution of a higher personality, and so to make the cognisance of the infinite unity, and all that thereby hangs a part of ourselves, as to render it a necessary intuition of the new personality. This is to be "<em>un vrai magiste qui ne pratique point la magie</em>," and to my mind this is, perhaps, the nobler, though, doubtless, the less attractive path.&mdash;<em>Trans.</em>] </p>

"Keep silence all who enter here," has from time immemorial been graved above the Portals of Occultism, "<em>Gopaniyum Prayatnena</em>," "to be kept secret with the greatest care" is the refrain of all the ancient Aryan writers on Psychism. But valid as this insistence on secrecy has been in the past, it must not be forgotten that evolution never sleeps, and that the wheel is ever turning. A new and higher race is scintillating on the dim horizon, and what are the highest secrets of one race, and intolerable to its mass, become the intuitions, if not the palpable verities, of the next.&mdash;<em>Trans</em>.] </p>

								<p> So, for that matter, I venture to submit, if words are used in their strict sense, is <em>Sam&#257;dhi</em>. The real difference consists in the fact that a mediumistic trance is generally the result of an abnormal and quasi-defective organisation, undertaken or fallen into suddenly without the preparations essential to render it innocuous to the health, and without the mental preparations necessary to the retention of the free exercise of the mind and will, and is only partially, often not at all, under control, while <em>Sam&#257;dhi</em> results from a long and careful series of exercises developing abnormal capacities in a normal organisation, and is preceded by a gradual training that protects the physical frame and habituates the mind and will to free exercise under

								<p> [121:1. <span class="note green block">(Very long footnote: extends from p. 121 to p. 127.) </span>The Septenary is sacred. not for one, but for a thousand reasons. Take any seven coins or discs of precisely the same size. Place one in the centre and you will find that the remaining six, when arranged round it as a belt, will exactly occupy the whole circumscribing space, each touching its neighbours and the original central one. Add, with other precisely similar discs, a similar second belt outside the first, a third outside the second, a fourth outside the third, and so on. Increase it, as you may, each belt will only contain six more pieces than the preceding one, with the one central piece as the seventh. The belts will contain 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 pieces and so on, the numbers being terms of an arithmetical progression of which the increment is 6. You may continue enlarging the circumference till it covers the whole Gobi desert, but you will he unable to add more than 6 for each belt to the number of its predecessor. This may seem childish, but we invite all the western mathematicians to explain the why of it, and on this principle the Universe both in its concrete and abstract manifestations is built up. </p> <!-- footnote 121:1 on p. 122 -->
								<p> Pythagoras speaks of the <em>Dodekahedron</em> as being the "Divine"--for the first circle of <em>one and six</em> is the <em>central circle</em>, the abstract, the <em>one</em> of nature <em>in abscondito</em>, and the most Occult. It is composed of the ONE, the central point, and of the <em>six</em>, the "number of perfection" of the Kabalists, having this perfection in itself, shared by no other, that by, the assemblage of its half, its third part, and its sixth part (one, two and three) it is made perfect. Therefore it is called "the sign of the world," for in six rounds the group of worlds attains its perfection, and during the seventh enjoys felicity, and neither nature nor beings labour or toil any more, but prepare in their perfection for Nirvana. With the Christian and Jewish Kabalists, it is the six days of creation and their Sabbath. </p>
								<p> And <em>seven</em> is called by Pythagoras "the vehicle of Life," etc. Seven in short is the symbol of this Yug, and Time. </p>
								<p> The Sab&aelig;ans worshipped the <em>seven</em> sons of Sabus. The <em>seven</em> "spirits of God" in Revelation mean simply the perfect man; so with its <em>seven</em> stars, lamps, etc.; and the Chaldean "stages" of the seven spheres and the <em>Birs Nimrud</em> with its <em>seven</em> stories, symbolical of the concentric circles of the <em>seven</em> spheres. </p>
								<p> You moderns, who laugh at the ignorance of the ancients, who <em>knew but of seven planets</em>, you have never understood what was really meant by this limited number; nor have you given one thought to the fact that men who presented Callisthenes (over 2,000 years ago) with records of celestial observations extending back from their time 1,900 years, could not have been ignorant of the existence of other planets. </p> <!-- footnote 121:1 on p. 123 -->
								<p> And what (not <em>who</em>) is SABAOTH, and why should have been regarded as a creator? How many Christians are there who suspect that SABAOTH was the Demiurgic number, <em>seven</em> with the Ph&oelig;nicians, who became later the Israelites? (Read <em>Lydus de Mens</em>. IV, 38, 74, 98, p. 112.) Seek for SABAOTH. ADONAIOS in the "Sibylline Books," <em>Gallacus</em>, 278. The <em>Demiurge</em> is <em>Iao</em> presiding over the <em>seven</em> circles of the <em>seven</em> Ghebers, the <em>seven</em> spirits of fire, astral light, <em>Fohat</em>, the seven Gabborim, or <em>kabiri</em>, the seven wandering stars, and it is those wanderers who under their collective name of <em>Kabar Ziv</em> (or Mighty Life or Light) as a Central Point emanates and allows to cluster round itself the <em>seven D&aelig;mons</em>. </p>

								<p> &mdash;E.O. </p> <!-- footnote 121:1 on p. 124 -->
								<p> As regards the little problem which E.O. invites Western Mathematicians to explain, it is simple enough. There is no mystery in it; it is a necessary consequence of the hypotheses involved in the premises. First the hypothesis involved in the description, to speak mathematically, of the figure we call a circle, the equality of all <em>radii</em>, and second the hypothesis that we are to use only equal circles. The proof is too long to insert, but it all proceeds from the known geometrical facts that where two circles touch, the line joining their centres passes through the point of contact; that where three circles touch the three lines joning their centres compose an equilateral and equiangular triangle; that the interior angles of a triangle are collectively equal to one-half of the angular extension round a point, and that each angle of an equilateral triangle is equal to one-sixth of this, and that consequently, only six such triangles, exactly this number and no more, can radiate from any point; that though the first belt may look circular, the second and succeeding ones cannot be constructed according to the terms of the problem except as hexagons, when again the properties (also the result of the hypothesis of construction) of the equilateral triangle come into play, and thus it is perfectly easy to demonstrate, that, not as a matter of mystery, but as a result following necessarily on the adopted premises, if there be <em>n</em> belts, then the <em>n</em>&apos;th must contain six <em>n</em> discs or circles. </p>
								<p> It seems useless to argue with Eastern adepts--from the time of the Gymnosophists, who taught Pythagoras, they have always, verbally at any rate, confounded things and their symbols. There is nothing <em>sacred</em> in the <em>number</em> seven; it is a <em>memoria technica</em> of hidden combinations, etc., which combinations, etc., are or may be held to be sacred, but as for the symbol <em>7</em>, or the word <em>seven</em>, there is nothing <em>sacred</em> in either, the sanctity, if any, pertains to the mysteries they recall, and in no way to the symbol or word. Had our language called 6+1, <em>pig</em>, or used--as the symbol for this, then <em>pig</em> and--would have been as <em>sacred</em> as <em>seven</em> and <em>7</em>. </p>
								<p> On the other hand to those who ridicule and reject the facts of the occultists on the ground that according to them the universe is built up upon one numerical system, and that everything is in sevens or threes, it may be useful to point out that even in this little world of ours we have instances of the persistent adherence of nature to particular numbers. Thus 3 and multiples of this rule the inflorescence of all <em>endogens</em> and4and 5 that of all <em>exogens</em>; and thousands of other instances can be given, so that the general rejection of occult views of the universe, on account of a symmetry in them, which is over hastily concluded to be unnatural, and, therefore, artificial and false, is not really warranted, even by our little learning. And as to 3 and 7, the latter grows necessarily out of the former, since 7 is the greatest possible number of products of three things taken, 1,2or3together. </p>
								<p> As for the seven impostors, <em>d&aelig;mons</em>, these were also considered, by some, to represent the cycle of necessity, which, according to them, beginning with Mars, ran through Jupiter and Saturn to the earth,
									<!-- footnote 121:1 on p. 126 --> and thence through Mercury and Venus to the sun. But though the Tibetan Brotherhood tell us that man does pass hence first to Mercury, they tell us that the Planet on which we lived immediately previous to our advent on this Earth was Mars and their account of the worlds that make up our cycle of necessity is quite different from that above referred to. But though according to this latter Saturn, and not Mars, was the Planet from which we last came, it does not follow that the Planet <em>we call</em> Saturn was really meant, or that the several Planets to which occultism has attached the sings, and names of the Planets known to the Astronomers of old, are <em>really</em> these very Planets. On the contrary, as a rule it may generally be concluded that when occultism says anything, it means something else. Words, like the names of planets, precious stones, minerals, plants, etc., always had two meanings&mdash;one, the palpable obvious one, which; if accepted, leads entirely astray, for the uninitiated; and the other, the artificial one, which gives the real fact for the initiated. This is what has, and I maintain rightly so, brought more discredit on occultism than anything else, and which must engender disbelief in or contempt for it, in the world at large, so long as it is persisted in. But the adepts of all schools have always been so tied down, by the vows and spiritual conditions (which it therefore no longer remains in a man's option to subsequently disregard) of the successive initiations, that they can, in many matters, not speak save in this deceptive phraseology, to' those not initiated, and
									<!-- footnote 121:1 on p. 127 --> these in their turn, as they progress, become by the immutable laws of the associations to which they belong, similarly tongue-tied and mind-bound; and, as to many things, the only hope for the world at large lies in the gradual development of the higher races on earth, who will, untaught in these schools, work out anew their knowledge for themselves, and untied by laws and conditions, now rapidly becoming an anachronism, give freely of <em>all</em> their store to <em>all</em> men. In this direction the authors of <em>The Perfect Way</em> have made the first important step.
								</p>
								<p> Of course, as to many matters, witness the facts given in the introduction, the adepts can speak more plainly, and are, nowadays, some of them, not so unwilling to speak as they have always hitherto been, but there remain the highest and most important laws of which, I am informed, they neither <em>will</em> nor <em>can</em> speak, save only to those who have been initiated, and are therefore for ever precluded from revealing the truth to any non-initiated.&mdash;<em>Trans</em>. </p>

Of course, like all sciences, Occultism has its methods, and a man must understand these before be can understand its demonstrations; just, for instance, as a man must understand the methods of mathematical physics, before he can understand the proof that the poles of the moon describe in space a certain very complicated curve. But this latter is none the less an exactly demonstrated fact, and so too are the teachings of Occultism, although to one ignorant of the methods of this latter science they may seem absolute mysteries and matters of <em>Faith</em>.&mdash;<em>Trans</em>.] </p>

								<p> Quite so, he <em>has</em> no <em>need</em>. Occultism only deals with the conditioned universe, which <em>to all conditioned</em> in it is infinite. Admittedly, <em>in</em> that Universe only Laws, and no God, <em>i.e.</em>, no conscious, intelligent will, the source of those laws, can be traced. So the Mage may justifiably say, "I content myself with the manifested and conditioned universe and believe in no God who, whether he exists somewhere <em>abscondite</em> or not, has not seen fit to indicate himself anywhere in manifestation, and cannot therefore, (if such a being exists) <em>want</em> men to believe in Him." </p>
								<p> But there are Mages and Mages, and there are some who say, granting all this, we yet know by a <em>higher</em> intuition that the infinite to all conditioned existence is yet not ALL, and that there is a conscious and intelligent will, the origin of those manifested laws which alone we creatures of manifestation can cognise.
