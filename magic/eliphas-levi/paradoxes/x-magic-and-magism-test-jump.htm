								THE name of magic, after having been so dreaded and so execrated in the Middle Ages,
								has become in our days almost ridiculous. A man who seriously occupies himself with
								Magic will hardly pass as a reasonable being unless set down as a physician and
								a quack. Credulous folks suppose that all magicians are workers of wonders, and
								being moreover convinced that only the Saints of their Communion have the right
								to perform miracles, attribute the ideas and phenomena of magic to the influence
								of the Devil or evil Spirits. For our part we believe that the miracles of the Saints,
								and those which are attributed to demons, are alike the natural results of causes
								which are abnormally brought into action. Nature never disturbs herself; her standing
								miracle is immutable and eternal order.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Moreover Magic must not be confounded with Magism. Magic is an occult force, and
									Magism is a doctrine which changes this force into a Power . A Magician without
									Magism is only a Sorcerer</em>. A magist without magic <em>is only one who</em>
								KNOWS. The author of this work is a magist who does not practise
								magic;&nbsp;<sup>99:1</sup>
								he is a man of study and not a man of phenomena&nbsp;<sup>99:2</sup>

								He does not claim to be either a magician or a mage, and he can only shrug his shoulders
								when he is taken for a sorcerer. He has studied the Kabala and the magical doctrines
								of the ancient sanctuaries; he feels that he understands them, and he sincerely
								believes in and admires them; to him they are the noblest and the truest Science
								that the world possesses, and he deeply regrets that they are so little known. For
								this it is that he seeks to make them better known, taking only the title of Professor
								of the Highest Science. The Science of Magism is contained in the books of the Kabala,
								in the Symbols of Egypt and of India,&nbsp;<sup>100:1</sup> in the books of Hermes
								Trismegistus, in the oracles of Zoroaster, and in the writings of some great men
								of the Middle Ages, like Dante, Paracelsus, Trithemus, William Postel, Pomponaceus,
								Robert Fludd, etc.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[100:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								The works of Magic are divination or prescience, Thaumaturgy or the use of exceptional
								powers, and Theurgy or rule over visions and spirits.
							</p>
							<p>
								One may divine or predict, either by observations and the inductions of wisdom,
								or by the intuitions of ecstasy or sleep, or by calculations of Science, or by the
								visions of enthusiasm, which is a species of intoxication. Indeed Paracelsus calls
								it "<em>ebriecatum</em>" or a species of ebriety. The states which are connected
								with somnambulism, exaltation, hallucination, intoxication whether by alcohol or
								drugs, in a word with all classes of artificial or accidental insanity in which
								the phosphorescence of the brain is increased or over-excited, are dangerous and
								contrary to nature, and it is wrong to attempt to produce them, because they derange
								the nervous equilibrium, and lead almost infallibly to frenzy, catalepsy and madness.
							</p>
							<p>
								Divination and prediction by mere sagacity demand a profound knowledge of the laws
								of Nature, a constant observation of phenomena and their correlation, the discernment
								of Spirits by the science of signs, the exact nature of analogies, and the calculation,
								be it integral or differential, of chances and probabilities. It is useful to divine
								and foresee, but we must not allow ourselves to divine or to mix ourselves up in
								predictions. A prophet interested in a matter is always a false prophet, because
								desire deranges sagacity; a prophet disinterested, that is to say a true prophet,
								always makes himself enemies, because there is always in this world more evil than
								good to predict; the occult sciences should always be kept hidden; the Initiate
								who speaks, profanes; <em>and he who knows not how to keep silence, knows
									nothing</em>.&nbsp;<sup>102:1</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[102:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								Noah foresaw the Deluge but took good care not to predict it. He held his tongue
								and built his ark. Joseph foresaw the seven years of famine and made his arrangements
								which secured to the king and priests all the wealth of Egypt. Jonah foretold the
								destruction of Nineveh, and fled in despair because his prediction was not accomplished.
								The early Christians predicted the burning of Rome, and Nero with some appearance
								of Justice accused them of having set it on fire. The Sorcerers of Macbeth drove
								him to regicide, by telling him that he would be a king. Prophecy seems to attract
								evil and often provokes crime. The Jews believed that the glory of God was involved
								in the eternal preservation of their Temple; to predict the destruction of this
								edifice was blasphemous. Jesus dared to do this, and the Jews, who but the day before
								had spread their garments beneath his feet and decked his path with branches and
								palms, cried all with one voice, "Let him be crucified!" But it was not for them
								that the Saviour had made this prediction, but for the small circle of his apostles
								and faithful followers; unfortunately it became public and served as a pretext for
								the judicial murder of the best and most divine of men.&nbsp;<sup>103:1</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[13:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								If we can predict exactly and certainly when eclipses are to occur and comets to
								return, why should we not be able to predict the periods of the greatnesses and
								decadences of empires? Being given the nature of a germ, do we not know what kind
								of tree it will produce? Knowing the motor, the impact and the obstacle, can we
								not determine the duration and extent of the movement? Read the book, entitled
								<em>Prognosticatio
									eximii docti Theophrasti Paracelsi</em>, and you will be astounded at the matters
								that this great man was able to foresee by combining the calculations of Science
								with the intuitions of a marvellous sagacity!
							</p>
							<p>
								One may predict with certainty by help of the calculations of science, and with
								<em>un</em>certainty by help of a sensitively impressionable nature, or magnetic
								intuition.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the same with miracles; these are astounding phenomena because they are abnormal
								and are produced in accordance with certain natural laws as yet unknown. When
								electricity
								was still a mystery for the multitude, electrical phenomena were miracles. Magnetic
								phenomena astonish at the present day the adepts of spiritism, because science has
								not yet officially recognised and determined the forces of human magnetism, which
								is distinct, according to our view, from animal magnetism. It is not yet known to
								what extent the imagination and will of man are powers. It is evident that in certain
								cases nature obeys them: the sick suddenly recover health, inert objects change
								their position without any apparent motive force, visible and palpable forms are
								produced; <em>the cause of all this is God for one set, the Devil for the other, and
									no one reflects that God is too great to condescend to conjuring tricks, and that
									the Devil, if he exists, as portrayed in legends, would be too intelligent and too
									proud to consent to be made ridiculous</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								All exclusive religions rely on miracles, and each attributes to the Devil the miracles
								of its opposing Faith. In this latter they are all to a certain extent right. The
								Devil is ignorance, the demons are false Gods. Now all false <em>Gods</em> perform
								miracles, the true God works only one, which is that of the eternal Order.
							</p>
							<p>
								The miracles of the Gospel are the wondrous operations of the Divine Spirit, related
								in an enigmatical style, as is the custom of the ancients and of Orientals especially.
								That spirit changes water into wine, <em>that is to say indifference into love</em>;
								it walks on the waters, and with a word stills tempests; it opens the eyes of the
								blind and the ears of the deaf; it makes the dumb to speak, and the paralytic to
								walk. <em>It resuscitates humanity buried for four days</em> (<em>that is for four
									thousand
									years</em>); it shows it in its putrefaction like Lazarus, and ordains that
								it be released from its bonds and from its shroud. Such are the true miracles of
								Christ, but if they ask him for prodigies, be replies, "An evil and adulterous
								generation
								seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it, but that of the prophet
								Jonas." Here the Master gives us to understand that the miracles of the Bible are
								also allegories. Jonas issuing alive from the fish that has swallowed him is humanity
								which regenerates itself. Jesus gave to the Jews as incontestable miracles the holiness
								of his doctrine and the example of his virtues.
							</p>
							<p>
								Jesus may certainly have healed the sick; since Vespasian, Apollonius, Gassner,
								Mesmer, and the Zouave Jacob have also healed the sick; sick people too may have
								been healed at Lourdes, as at the tomb of the deacon Paris; but such cures are not
								miracles, they are the natural results of a certain exaltation in Faith. Jesus Christ
								said so himself. "Can you cure me?" asked a certain sick person; "If thou canst
								believe," said the Master, "all things are possible to him that believeth."
							</p>
							<p>
								Faith produces certain apparent miracles, and credulity exaggerates them. When Jesus
								said that all was possible to Faith, he did not mean by this to say that the impossible
								could ever become the possible.
							</p>
							<p>
								The impossible is that which is absolutely contrary to the immutable laws of nature,
								and to the eternal Reason.&nbsp;<sup>106:1</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[106:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								Every man is a magnetic focus, which attracts and radiates. That attraction and
								that projection are what are called in magic the inspiration and respiration. The
								good inspire and respire good, the wicked attract and respire evil; the good may
								heal the body, because they make the souls better, the wicked do harm both to souls
								and bodies. Often the wicked attract good to corrupt it, and the good attract evil
								to change it into good. Thus it is that at times the wicked seem to prosper, whilst
								the good are victims of their own virtues; but they grossly deceive themselves who
								fancy that Tiberius at Capri was happier than Mary at the foot of the cross of her
								son. What pleasure nevertheless was wanting to Tiberius, what suffering to Mary?
								And yet how happy a mother,&nbsp;<sup>106:2</sup> how miserable an Emperor!
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[106:2. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								Honey changes to gall&nbsp;<sup>107:1</sup> in the mouths of the wicked and gall
								into honey in the mouths of the just. The innocent man, sacrificed, is deified by
								his punishment; the guilty man, triumphant, is branded and burnt by his diadem.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[107:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								Let us now touch the dangerous and darkness-shrouded coasts of magic, the intercourse
								with the other world, the contact with the invisibles, Theurgy and the evocation
								of spirits.
							</p>
							<p>
								Everything proves to us that there exist other intelligent beings than man. The
								Hierarchy of spirits must be infinite as that of bodies. The mysterious ladder of
								Jacob is the Biblical Symbol of this Hierarchy ascending and descending. God rests
								upon that ladder or rather he sustains it. We may say that that ladder is in him,
								or rather that it is He, Himself, for it is as a God, and to manifest God, that
								the Infinite ascends and descends.
							</p>
							<p>
								At each rundle the Spirit which rises is equal to the one that descends, and can
								take his hand; but he still must needs follow him who ascends in front of him. This
								is a law which those who make evocations should seriously meditate.
							</p>
							<p>
								To ascend eternally is the hope of the blessed; to descend eternally is the threat
								that weighs upon the reprobated.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Men invoke superior spirits, but they can only evoke inferior spirits.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Superior spirits whom men invoke attract them upwards; inferior spirits whom men
									evoke draw them downwards</em>.&nbsp;<sup>108:1</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[108:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								Invocation is prayer, evocation is sacrilege, except when it is a very dangerous
								devotion.
							</p>
							<p>
								But the rash mortals who plunge into evocations have no thoughts of making the spirit
								whom they call ascend with them; they want to lean on it to rise by, and must
								necessarily
								lose their balance in leaning on what is descending.
							</p>
							<p>
								The spirit which descends is as a load to him who would raise it, and it necessarily
								drags down him who abandons himself to it! To renounce the reason to follow the
								inspirations of a phantom, this is to plunge into the abyss of madness.
							</p>
							<p>
								The great epoch of Theurgy was that of the fall of the ancient Gods. Maximus of
								Ephesus invoked them before Julian, because men had ceased to invoke them; they
								had sunk below even the reason of the common people; also to Julian they appeared
								thin, poor, and decrepit. Julian, fanaticised by the magic of the past, wished to
								take these infirm immortals on his back, as &AElig;neas saved his father from the
								conflagration of Troy, and the arrogant philosopher fell under the burthen of his
								Gods.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>We cannot see the Gods without dying. This is one of the most formidable axioms
									of ancient Theurgy, for the Gods are the immortals; to see them we must Pass out
									of our Plane into theirs and enter into incorporeal life, and if this be Possible
									without dying, it is only so in an imaginary or fictitious manner, or by an illusion
									resembling that of dreams</em>. We must conclude that every apparition which
								we survive can only be a dream; when a vision of the other world is real, either
								the seer dies, or rather is already dead when he sees it.&nbsp;<sup>109:1</sup>
								This which we write has assuredly no sense for the learned materialists who do not
								believe in another life, but these are compelled, in defiance of all evidence, to
								deny the phenomena of magnetism and spiritism; and cannot, therefore, be sincere-the
								true savants are those who believe.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[109:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								The danger lies in believing without knowing; for then one believes in the absurd,
								that is to say in the impossible. The old French language had a word to express
								rash belief; it was the verb <em>cuyder</em>, whence is derived our word
								<em>outrecuidance</em>,
								which signifies a ridiculous and presumptuous confidence.
							</p>
							<p>
								Theurgy is a dream pushed to the most terrifying realism in a man who believes himself
								awake. It is attained by weakening and exciting the brain, by fasts, meditations
								and watching. Asceticism is the father of nightmares and the creator of demons,
								the most grotesque and deformed. Paracelsus thought that real
								Larv&aelig;&nbsp;<sup>111:1</sup>
								might be engendered by the nocturnal illusions of celibates. The ancients believed
								in the existence of <em>daimones</em>, a race of malicious genii who floated about
								in the atmosphere. St. Paul seems to admit these when he talks of the powers of
								the air against whom we have to fight; the Kabalists peopled the four elements,
								and named their inhabitants Sylphs, Undines, Gnomes and Salamanders.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[111:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								Young, hysterically disposed virgins in the middle ages used to see White Ladies
								appear near springs; in those days they called such phantoms fairies; nowadays when
								the same phenomena repeat themselves, people are persuaded that the Virgin has shown
								herself on earth, and they found churches and organise pilgrimages, which still
								bring in a great deal of money despite the decline of Faith. We must not insist
								in matters of Religion on enlightening the multitude too soon.&nbsp;<sup>111:2</sup>
								There are people who could no longer believe in God if they ceased to believe in
								our Lady of Lourdes. Let us leave the consolation of the dream to those who do not
								yet know bow to apply the remedy of reason to their ills. Illusions are better than
								despair; it is better to do good through a misconception than to do evil through
								the weakness of a rebellious reason and an&aelig;mia of the conscience.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[111:2. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								Moses, in causing the construction of the Ark of Alliance, made a concession to
								the idolatry of the Jewish populace, and the golden calves of Samaria were later
								only counterfeits of the Keroubim of the ark; these Keroubim or Cherubim were two-headed
								Sphinxes; there were two Cherubim and four heads, one of a child, the other of a
								bull, the third of a lion and the fourth of an eagle. It was a reminiscence of the
								Gods of the Egyptians, Horus, Apis, Celurus, and Hermomphta; symbols of the four
								elements&nbsp;<sup>112:1</sup> and signs of the four cardinal points of the heaven
								they served as emblems of the four cardinal virtues&mdash;prudence, temperance, strength
								and justice. These four hieroglyphic figures have remained in the Christian Symbology
								and they have been made the insignia of the four evangelists.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[112:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								The Catholic Church has condemned the breakers of images, and yet well knew that
								images are but idols; the word idol in Greek signifies nothing else but an image,
								and the pagans no more believed that a statue of Jupiter was Jupiter, than we believe
								that an image of the Virgin is the Virgin in person. <em>They</em> believed, as
								<em>we</em> do, in a possible manifestation of the divinity through such images;
								they had like ourselves statues that wept, that rolled their eyes, and sang at sunrise;
								we have, like them, our mythology, and the <em>Golden Legend</em> might form a sequel
								to the <em>Metamorphoses</em> of Ovid. Nothing destroys itself in the universal
								Revelation, but everything transforms and continues itself; <em>the manifestation of
									God produces itself in the human genius by successive approximations and by
									progressive
									changes. God is always the ideal of human perfection, which grows in grandeur as
									man raises himself</em>. God did not speak once, to hold his peace ever after.
								He speaks, as he creates, always.
							</p>
							<p>
								Torquemada and Fénélon were both Christians and Catholics, and yet the God of Fénélon
								resembles in nothing the God of Torquemada. St. Frances of Sales and Father Garassus
								do not speak of God in at all the same manner, and the Catholicism of Monsignor
								Dupanloup hardly bears any likeness to that of Louis Venillot.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Protestants have levelled everything. They have denied all they could not
								understand,
								and they hardly understand what they affirm, but Revelation does not retreat; she
								is not impoverished, but adds always something to the mysterious riches of her dogma;
								the Rabbis, to throw light on the obscurities of the Bible, redouble the darkness
								in the Talmud, and the Christian ages have given, as a sequel to and commentaries
								on the incredible accounts of the Gospels, the impossible Legends of the Lives of
								the Saints. To those who deny the infallibility of the Church, we reply with the
								infallibility of the Pope. Always the enigma is made more complicated to prevent
								fools from guessing it, for all Dogma is a philosophical enigma.
							</p>
							<p>
								TRINITY, or the three in one, signifies UNITY. INCARNATION, or God made man, that
								signifies HUMANITY. REDEMPTION, or all lost through one and saved by one, that indicates
								our mutual interdependence, the SOLIDARITY of the race.
							</p>
							<p>
								UNITY, HUMANITY, SOLIDARITY, this will be the Trilogy of the future; pacific solution
								of the Revolutionary problem LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY.
							</p>
							<p>
								Truly it is Social Unity alone that can guarantee the liberty of nations by creating
								Universal Right; it is before Humanity alone and not before Nature that men are
								equal; and it is the mutual interdependence or solidarity which alone proves fraternity.
								But how many ages must elapse before these Truths, simple as they are, will be
								understood?
							</p>
							<p>
								Catholicism is official occultism and rests entirely upon mystery. The secret of
								the sanctuaries has been profaned, but has not been explained.
							</p>
							<p>
								&OElig;dipus thought to kill the Sphinx, and the plague fell upon Thebes. His hostile
								brothers still fight and slay each other once more. The grand Symbols of the Past
								are the prophecies of the Future; mysteries and miracles, such must be the Religion
								for the masses whom it is essential to make feel keenly what they do not understand,
								so that they may permit themselves to be led. This is the secret of the sanctuary,
								and the magists of all times have understood it. The weak can only remain united
								under the surveillance and responsibility of the strong; the strong emancipate
								themselves.
								If there had never been shepherds, there would have been no tame sheep; if dogs
								were free, that is to say wild, they would have to be hunted like wolves: and truly,
								the vulgar are either wolves or sheep; it is servitude alone that saves them.
							</p>
							<p>
								The great secret of Freemasonry is nothing else than the science of nature. It has
								long since been divulged, but people still swear to preserve it eternally, thus
								rendering homage to the eternal principle of occultism.
							</p>
							<p>
								The true Initiates are shepherds and conquerors, they raise the sheep and conquer
								the wolves; this was, in the beginning, the sublime mission of the Church, but in
								this sheepfold of the Lord, the wolves have become shepherds and the flocks have
								fled away.
							</p>
							<p>
								The true Church must be one, and not divided into numerous sects; it must be holy,
								and not hypocritical or greedy; it must be universal, and not restricted to a privileged
								circle that repels almost the whole of Humanity. In a word it must attach itself
								to a common centre, which in the Roman world was Rome,. but which is no more irrevocably
								Rome than Jerusalem. "The wind bloweth where it listeth," said the Master, and so
								is every one that is born of the Spirit. " . . . wheresoever the body is, thither
								will the eagles be gathered together."
							</p>
							<p>
								The Catholic Church ought to be the House Mother of universal indulgence. She does
								not tolerate merely, she absolves; she ought to excommunicate religious hatreds
								and bless even her children who have strayed. It is through the Catholic faith that
								all sincere believers, no matter what creed they profess, belong to the soul of
								the Church, provided they practise natural morality and seek the truth in sincerity
								of heart. Let only a Pope appear who will loudly proclaim these consolatory truths,
								and invite all the nations of the earth to an universal jubilee, and a new era will
								dawn for the Christian Religion.
							</p>
							<p>
								Glory to God in all that is great, and peace and good will to men on Earth! It was
								by this cry of universal love that the genius of the Gospels, announced in old days
								the birth of the Saviour of the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Official Church represents the Occult Church as the castes of society represent
								the natural Hierarchy; the Priests, the Nobility and the People represent the men
								of devotion, the men who are superior in intelligence and the men who are inferior.
							</p>
							<p>
								The true priests of Humanity are the sincere philanthropists; the true kings are
								the men of genius; the true nobles, the men of intelligence and lofty sentiments;
								the common mass is the great flock of the voluntarily ignorant and poltroons. A
								simple soldier faithful to his flag is surely greater than a Marshal of France who
								betrays his country.
							</p>
							<p>
								An honest rag-picker is more noble than a vicious prince; eminent men in all departments
								have risen from the people, and kings and queens have been seen dragging themselves
								through the mire. Every intelligent and virtuous man may deserve admission to the
								highest initiation; the profane are only fools or knaves.
							</p>
							<p>
								The initiate is a man of no party; he desires only unity, mutual indulgence and
								peace. He has no opinions, for truth is not an opinion; for him all hostilities
								are errors, and all curses, crimes.
							</p>

								Before the abuses of the Romish Church, protestation is a right and consequently
								a truth; but Protestantism is a sect, and therefore a falsehood. Catholicity, that
								is to say Universality, is the character of true religion, it is therefore a truth,
								but Catholicism is a <em>party</em> and consequently a falsehood. When abuses have
								ceased, protestation will no longer have any reason to exist, and when Catholicity
								shall have been established throughout the world, there will he no more Catholicism
								at Rome.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the meantime, as one cannot live respectably&nbsp;<sup>117:1</sup> without religion,
								and as it is impossible and absurd to stand alone in religion, since the very word
								religion signifies a thing that binds men to one another,&nbsp;<sup>117:2</sup> each
								can and ought to follow the usages and rights of the communion in which he was
								born.&nbsp;<sup>117:3</sup>
								All religions have a respectable side and a defective side.

								Let us no more break each other's Idols, but let us lead all men gently out of Idolatry.
								One must learn to endure patiently in Catholic Churches the noise of the ceremonial,
								and of the halberd of the Swiss, to weary oneself in all gravity and respect in
								the Protestant temples, to keep serious in the Synagogue and the Mosque despite
								the muffled heads of the Rabbis and the contortions of the Dervishes. All this must
								have its time.

							<p>
								<em>One</em> religion passes away, but <em>Religion</em> remains one man dies, but
								humanity dies not; one woman ceases to love or be lovable, but woman is ever worthy
								of respect and love; one rose fades all too soon, but the rose is an imperishable
								flower, and blooms anew in every spring. Let us make use of Religions for the sake
								of Religion, love men for the sake of humanity, and women for the love of woman;
								let us seek the rose amidst the roses, and we shall never find deception or despair.

								But because we are men, we must not insist on the children being men. We must not
								beat them because they fall, nor use them harshly because they do not understand
								things that are above their age. We must not rob them of their Punches and their
								dolls; they adore them; later they will break them; mamma will give them others,
								and papa will have nothing to say.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Sacred Books of all nations in all times have been collections of fables; they
								are the books and pictures made for the instruction of children.
							</p>
							<p>
								They are generally collective works resuming all the knowledge and all the highest
								aspirations of one people and one epoch. They are sacred as monuments should be,
								and worthy of respect, as is the memory of ancestors. The Divine Spirit has assuredly
								inspired them, but inspired them to men and not to Gods.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>They reveal God, as the tree which grows reveals the seed planted in the earth,
									or as the rising dough reveals the hidden leaven</em>. This double comparison
								is borrowed from Jesus Christ Himself.
							</p>
							<p>
								We have said that the absurdities of Dogma are enigmatic; they are even more systematic.
								The great Initiates of the Ancient World never explained their symbols except by
								obscure symbols. God wills to be divined, because divination is divine, as the word
								itself sufficiently indicates. The riddle of the Sphinx is the trial of all Neophytes,
								and the three-headed dog watches always at the portals of the crypt of the mysteries.
								In Religion, to explain is to profane; to make more obscure is to reveal.
							</p>
							<p>
								Science and Religion are as the day and night. If reason be the sun, faith is the
								moon.&nbsp;<sup>120:1</sup> In the absence of the Sun, the Moon is the sovereign
								of the heavens. Let us, however, not forget that it is from the Sun that she borrows
								all her rays, and that true Faith can never be absurd except in seeming.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">

								Science, has not she too her mysteries? Escape if you can out of the labyrinth of
								the Infinite. Do indivisible molecules really exist? Endeavour to conceive substance
								without extension.&nbsp;<sup>120:2</sup> If on the contrary matter is infinitely
								divisible, one grain of dust may, in the infinity of time, by the infinite number
								of its parts, equal the infinity of space.&nbsp;<sup>120:3</sup> Absurdities on
								all sides! Ask Marphurius; he desires to explain that the polychronic evolution
								of analytical concepts, in the Relative, is equal to the isochronism

								of the synthetical concept in the Absolute, and he thence concludes that the synchretism
								of the Abstract is analogous to the synchretism of the Concrete.&mdash;<em>Cabricias
									arciturane</em>!
							</p>
							<p>
								The mysteries of faith are borrowed for the most part from the mysteries of science;
								for instance, is not light <em>one</em>, in three rays of different colours? In
								its triplicity it is blue, yellow and red, in its unity it is white. This Trinity
								gives seven shades of colour; here we have the sacred septenary.&nbsp;<sup>121:1</sup>
								Light produces forms, it is incarnate in living beings, it dies to revive, and buys
								back each morning our hemisphere from the slavery of the night. Dupuis concluded
								thence that Jesus Christ was the Sun; a fine discovery! It is as though one professed
								that a sphere of cardboard was positively the Universe.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[121:1. ]

							<p>
								Religion is a force which escapes from the impious and against which they break
								themselves. Punch will never succeed in killing the Devil, for the Devil is a caricature
								of God, and this caricature belongs to those who have made it. It remains in their
								eyes, it fascinates and pursues them. If all the blind could coalesce to exterminate
								those who can see, could they even then extinguish the Sun?
							</p>
							<p>
								The masses are blind and foolish and must be led by the seers and the sages. But
								when those whose duty it is to lead the blind, become blind, when the keepers of
								the mad go mad themselves, there result falls and appalling disorders. This is the
								history of all revolutions.
							</p>
							<p>
								The use of brute force to repress disorder provokes inevitable and terrible reactions
								when that force has not the support of justice and Truth: for then it becomes
								fateful&nbsp;<sup>127:1</sup>
								and balances, necessarily, action by reaction. War authorises reprisals, because
								in war, according to the cynical saying of a great German diplomatist, it is might
								that makes right; and indeed despotism, whether of kings or mobs, is war; the authority
								of the Law and the empire of justice is peace.

								Social Unity is the end and aim of civilisation and transcendental politics, an
								end at which, from the time of Nimrod, all great conquerors and profound statesmen
								have aimed. The Assyrians, the Medes, the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, all
								sought to absorb the world. Bacchus, Hercules, Alexander, Caesar, Peter the Great,
								Napoleon, had no other dream; the Popes thought to realise it under the name of
								Religion, and it was a grand idea; but Germany nowadays opposes mathematics to the
								enthusiastic onrush of beliefs, and swells day, by day her exchequer. The Emperor,
								one of the two pillars of the world, is now again erect, and he is no longer Roman.
								Rome on one side, and on the other the whole world-the balance is no longer equal;
								we should necessarily require a cosmopolitan Pope, when we had an universal Emperor.
							</p>
							<p>
								High magic is at once Religion and Science. This alone harmonises contraries by
								explaining the laws of equilibrium and of analogies. This alone can make sovereign
								Pontiffs infallible and Monarchs absolute; the Sacerdotal art is also the Royal
								art, and Count Joseph de Maistre was not deceived when, despairing of extinguished
								beliefs and enfeebled powers, he turned his glances, against his will, towards the
								sanctuaries of Occultism. It is thence that salvation will come, and already it
								is revealing itself to the most advanced intelligences.
							</p>
							<p>
								Freemasonry, which has so frightened the Court of Rome, is not so terrible as people
								think; it has lost its ancient lights, but has preserved its symbols and its rites
								which belong to Occult Philosophy; it still gives the titles and the ribbons of
								the Rosy Cross, but the true Rosicrucians are no longer in its Lodges; they are
								what they have been from the beginning&mdash;philosophers and <em>unknown</em>.
								Paschalis,
								Martines and St. Martin have successors who do not meet in regular assemblies. Their
								Lodge is said to be in the great Pyramid of Egypt, an expression, allegorical and
								mystical, which the innocent and ignorant are at liberty to take literally.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is one thing more incontestably infallible than the Pope, and that is mathematics.
								Truths rigorously demonstrated force the mind to suppositions which we may call
								the necessary hypotheses. These hypotheses, if I may so express myself, are the
								scientific objects of Faith. But the imagination, exalted by an infinite want to
								believe and love, draws incessantly from this rational objective paradoxical deductions;
								to curb licence and mystic fantasies, there must be an authority touching reason
								on the one side and mysticism on the other; this authority, dogmatically infallible,
								has no need to, and <em>cannot</em>, he so scientifically. Science and Faith are
								the two columns of the Temple; they support its portico.
							</p>
							<p>
								If they were both on the same side, the structure must fall on the other.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is their separation and parallelism which should eternally maintain
								equilibrium.&nbsp;<sup>130:1</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[130:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								The comprehension of this principle would put a stop to a misconception of too long
								standing and would bring peace to many souls. In truth between science and faith
								no real antagonism can subsist. All that has been demonstrated becomes unassailable,
								and it is impossible to believe in what one knows positively not to be true. Galileo
								knew that the earth turned, but he knew also that the authority of the Church is
								unassailable because the Church is necessary. The Church has no authority in matters
								of science, but can oppose with all her power the dissemination of particular scientific
								truths which she judges to be at the moment prejudicial to the Faith. People very
								generally believed in Galileo's time that the popularisation of the system of Copernicus
								would give the lie to the Bible. Forced later to admit that system, because it was
								demonstrated it became of course necessary to find means of reconciling the difference;
								the earth in fact turns, but the Church remains infallible, even when it declares
								that it is no longer itself, but our Holy Father the Pope, who is
								infallible.&nbsp;<sup>131:1</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[131:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								This is not said ironically; the Pope is infallible because it is necessary that
								he should be so, and he really is so, for those who believe it, since his infallibility
								only extends to matters of Faith.
							</p>
							<p>
								The work of science is to detach Faith from the letter and attach it to the spirit;
								in proportion as science rises, Faith is exalted.
							</p>
							<p>
								The eternal Evangel is like the cloud that led the Jews in the wilderness; it has
								one face of shadow and one face of light; the face of shadow is its mystery, the
								face of light its reason. The shadow is spread over the letter, the light emanates
								from the spirit.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is the Gospel of Faith and the Gospel of Science. Moreover Science renders
								Faith impregnable; those who doubt do not know.&nbsp;<sup>131:2</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[131:2 ]
							</p>
							<p>
								Ignorant faith only preserves itself by obstinacy, and obstinacy in ignorance is
								only fanaticism.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Whoso believes without knowing, but without fanaticism, will very soon begin to
									doubt, and that doubt can only have as its result either knowledge or
									indifference</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								We must learn, or cease to believe. To cease to believe is easier, but for the soul
								to cease to believe is to cease to love; and to cease to love, is to cease to live.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fanatics are sick, but still they are living; the indifferent are dead.
							</p>
							<p>
								Blind beliefs do not improve mankind; they may restrain them through fear or allure
								them by hope, but fear and desire are not virtues. A dog may restrain his appetite
								under fear of the whip, but he none the less remains, greedy, he only adds cowardice
								to greed. So to believe to any good purpose, we must know. It has been said that
								a little science detaches from God, and that a great deal of science leads us back
								again to Him; this saying must be explained by stating that a commencement of Science
								and Philosophy detaches man <em>from the God of the foolish</em>, while the acquisition
								of much of these brings him to the <em>God of the wise</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Magist has no need to formulate his faith in God,&nbsp;<sup>133:1</sup> he feels
								in himself that supreme power of the True and the God, which animates, sustains,
								fortifies and consoles him. What need have we to define the light when one can see
								it? What avails it to prove life, when one is alive? When St. Paul was converted,
								say the Acts of the Apostles, he felt as though scales had fallen from his eyes.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[133:1. ]
							</p>
							<p>
								The scales which cover the eyes of our souls are the vain conceits of a rash theology
								and the unhealthy sophisms of a false philosophy. The initiates are the seers and
								for the thoughtful, to see is to know, to know is to will, to will is to dare; but
								to dare with success, we must <em>will</em> and know how to be silent.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Never be zealous," said Talleyrand, and the same diplomatist averred that speech
								was given us to disguise our thoughts. This political mummery is not to our taste;
								we do not say disguise; we say reclothe and chastely veil that Virgin that we call
								thought, for <em>our</em> thought is not a thought of personal interest and falsehood;
								<em>the Veil of the sanctuary is not like the curtain of comedy; it is rent at times,
									but it never rises</em>.&nbsp;<sup>134:1</sup>
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[134:1. ]

							<p>
								The initiate avoids with care all eccentricity; he <em>thinks</em> as do the most
								enlightened, and <em>speaks</em> as do the mass. If he explores cross roads it is
								only to reach more surely and quickly the grand route; he knows that true thoughts
								are like running water. Those of the Past flow in the Present, and roll on towards
								the Future without our needing to toil backwards to their source to find them; and
								he allows himself to be tranquilly borne onwards by the current, but he holds ever
								to mid-stream, never bruising himself against the rocks that line its banks.
