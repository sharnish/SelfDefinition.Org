								<li>
									<p>
										Know that All is One.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that everything is Thyself.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that the One in a state of vibration produces the great multiplicity of forms and activities in the Universe.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that if you examine this multiplicity from the standpoint of your intellectual reasoning, you will arrive at the following deductions:
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Everything that you call "Life," "Energy," "Substance," is a Duality.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Everything has a tendency to return to Unity.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										All desire and therefore all suffering originates from duality.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Let thy aspiration be for enlightenment.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that the result of the joys experienced by the attainment of enlightenment is happiness.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Rise above the state of condensation.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that the result of the joys experienced in the state of condensation is suffering.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										On the road from Unity in motion to tranquillity is the state of condensation. It is the cause of your illusions, because you imagine it to be tranquillity; and it is the cause of your doubts, because you regard it as the object of your desires.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that the striving after the unification of the duality is the only source of your will, your desires, and of those joys whose results you call "suffering."
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that the door for the solution of that which is fixed is what is called "Matter."
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that everything has to pass through that door.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that the door for the solution of the fixed is also called "Life."
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Know that everything has to pass through that door.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										And that the long sojourn in "Matter" and the interruption of the voyage by "Life" means retardation in the solution of the fixed and procrastination in the unification of the duality.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Enforce the practice of the power of that which is solved over that which is condensed.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Direct your attention to the consciousness of that which is dissolved over that which is condensed.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Carry this consciousness through all the planes of your being.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Elevate your whole body to the capacity to think, to hear, and to see.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Cause it thereby to become a fit instrument for the use of your self-consciousness of the One and of your self-power (resulting from unification).
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Conquer the pains resulting therefrom.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										When the divine Language is once heard within thy heart &ndash; when the <em>King</em> within thy interior has once obtained dominion &ndash; when thou hast passed through water and fire, and thy spirit has become the life of thy blood &ndash; then you may say: <em>I am, I go, and I remain.</em>
