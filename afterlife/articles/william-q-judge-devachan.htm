								The State After Death

							<p>
								Having shown that just beyond the threshold of human life there
								is a place of separation wherein the better part of man is divided
								from his lower and brute elements, we come to consider what is
								the state after death of the real being, the immortal who travels
								from life to life. </p>

							<p>Struggling out of the body the entire man goes
								into <strong>kama loka,</strong> to purgatory, where he again struggles
								and loosens himself from the lower <strong>skandhas;</strong> this period
								of birth over, the higher principles, <strong>Atma-Buddhi-Manas</strong>,
								begin to think in a manner different from that which the body
								and brain permitted in life. This is the state of <strong>Devachan</strong>,
								a Sanskrit word meaning literally &quot;the place of the gods,&quot;
								where the soul enjoys felicity; but as the gods have no such bodies
								as ours, the Self in <strong>devachan</strong> is devoid of a mortal body.</p>
							<p>
								In the ancient books it is said that this state lasts</p>
							<blockquote>
								&quot;for years of infinite number,&quot; or &quot;for a period proportionate
								to the merit of the being&quot;; and when the mental forces peculiar
								to the state are exhausted, &quot;the being is drawn down again
								to be reborn in the world of mortals.&quot;</blockquote>

							<p> <strong>Devachan</strong> is
								therefore an interlude between births in the world. The law of
								karma which forces us all to enter the world, being ceaseless
								in its operation and also universal in scope, acts also on the
								being in <strong>devachan,</strong> for only by the force or operation
								of Karma are we taken out of <strong>devachan.</strong> It is something
								like the pressure of atmosphere which, being continuous and uniform,
								will push out or crush that which is subjected to it unless there
								be a compensating quantity of atmosphere to counteract the pressure.</p>
							<p>
								In the present case the karma of the being is the atmosphere always
								pressing the being on or out from state to state; the counteracting
								quantity of atmosphere is the force of the being's own life-thoughts
								and aspirations which prevent his coming out of <strong>devachan</strong> until
								that force is exhausted, but which being spent has no more power
								to hold back the decree of our self-made mortal destiny.</p>
							<p>
								The necessity for this state after death is one of the necessities
								of evolution growing out of the nature of mind and soul. The very
								nature of <strong>manas</strong> requires a devachanic state as soon as
								the body is lost, and it is simply the effect of loosening the
								bonds placed upon the mind by its physical and astral encasement.
							</p>
							<p>In life we can but to a fractional extent act out the thoughts
								we have each moment; and still less can we exhaust the psychic
								energies engendered by each day's aspirations and dreams. The
								energy thus engendered is not lost or annihilated, but is stored
								in <strong>Manas,</strong> but the body, brain, and astral body permit
								no full development of the force. Hence, held latent until death,
								it bursts then from the weakened bonds and plunges <strong>Manas,</strong>
								the thinker, into the expansion, use, and development of the thought-force
								set up in life. </p>
							<p>
								The impossibility of escaping this necessary state
								lies in man's ignorance of his own powers and faculties. From
								this ignorance delusion arises, and <strong>Manas</strong> not being wholly
								free is carried by its own force into the thinking of <strong>devachan.
								</strong>But while ignorance is the cause for going into this state
								the whole process is remedial, restful, and beneficial. For if
								the average man returned at once to another body in the same civilization
								he had just quitted, his soul would be completely tired out and
								deprived of the needed opportunity for the development of the
								higher part of his nature.</p>
							<p>
								Now the Ego being minus mortal body and <strong>kama,</strong> clothes
								itself in <strong>devachan</strong> with a vesture which cannot be called
								body but may be styled means or vehicle, and in that it functions
								in the devachanic state entirely on the plane of mind and soul.
								Everything is as real then to the being as this world seems to
								be to us. It simply now has gotten the opportunity to make its
								own world for itself unhampered by the clogs of physical life.
								Its state may be compared to that of the poet or artist who, rapt
								in ecstacy of composition or arrangement of color, cares not for
								and knows not of either time or objects of the world.</p>
							<p>
								We are making causes every moment, and but two fields exist for
								the manifestation in effect of those causes. These are, the objective,
								as this world is called, and the subjective, which is both here
								and after we have left this life. The objective field relates
								to earth life and the grosser part of man, to his bodily acts
								and his brain thoughts, as also sometimes to his astral body.
								The subjective has to do with his higher and spiritual parts.
								In the objective field the psychic impulses cannot work out, nor
								can the high leanings and aspirations of his soul; hence these
								must be the basis, cause, substratum, and support for the state
								of <strong>devachan.</strong>

							<h4>
								Time
							</h4>

							<p>
								What then is the time, measured by mortal
								years, that one will stay in <strong>devachan?</strong></p>
							<p>
								This question while dealing with what earth-men call time does
								not, of course, touch the real meaning of time itself, that is,
								of what may be in fact for this solar system the ultimate order,
								precedence, succession, and length of moments. It is a question
								which may be answered in respect to our time, but not certainly
								in respect to the time on the planet Mercury, for instance, where
								time is not the same as ours, nor, indeed, in respect to time
								as conceived by the soul. </p>
							<p>
								As to the latter any man can see that
								after many years have slipped away he has no direct perception
								of the time just passed, but is able only to pick out some of
								the incidents which marked its passage, and as to some poignant
								or happy instants or hours he seems to feel them as but of yesterday.
							</p>
							<p>
								And thus it is for the being in <strong>devachan</strong>. No time is
								there. The soul has all the benefit of what goes on within itself
								in that state, but it indulges in no speculations as to the lapse
								of moments; all is made up of events, while all the time the solar
								orb is marking off the years for us on the earth plane. This cannot
								be regarded as an impossibility if we will remember how, as is
								well known in life, events, pictures, thoughts, argument, introspective
								feeling will all sweep over us in perfect detail in an instant,
								or, as is known of those who have been drowning, the events of
								a whole life time pass in a flash before the eye of the mind.
							</p>
							<p>

								But the Ego remains as said in <strong>devachan</strong> for a time exactly
								proportioned to the psychic impulses generated during life. Now
								this being a matter which deals with the mathematics of the soul,
								no one but a Master can tell what the time would be for the average
								man of this century in every land. Hence we have to depend on
								the Masters of wisdom for that average, as it must be based upon
								a calculation.
							</p>
							<div class="right-image-div">
								<img src="images/Sinnet-Esoteric-Buddhism-cover.jpg" alt="A.P. Sinnet, Esoteric Buddhism cover" title="A.P. Sinnet, Esoteric Buddhism cover" />
								<p></p>
							</div>
							<p>
								They have said, as is well put by Mr. A. P. Sinnett
								in his <cite>Esoteric Buddhism,</cite> that the period is fifteen
								hundred years in general. From a reading of his book, which was
								made up from letters from the Masters, it is to be inferred he
								desires it to be understood that the devachanic period is in each
								and every case fifteen centuries; but to do away with that misapprehension
								his informants wrote at a later date that that is the average
								period and not a fixed one. Such must be the truth, for as we
								see that men differ in respect to the periods of time they remain
								in any state of mind in life due to the varying intensities of
								their thoughts, so it must be in <strong>devachan</strong> where thought
								has a greater force though always due to the being who had the
								thoughts.</p>
							<p>
								What the Master did say on this is as follows: &quot;The 'dream
								of <strong>devachan</strong>' lasts until karma is satisfied in that direction.
								In <strong>devachan</strong> there is a gradual exhaustion of force. The
								stay in <strong>devachan</strong> is proportionate to the unexhausted
								psychic impulses originated in earth life. Those whose actions
								were preponderatingly material will be sooner brought back into
								rebirth by the force of <strong>Tanha</strong>.&quot;
							</p>
							<p><strong>Tanha</strong> is the thirst
								for life. He therefore who has not in life originated many psychic
								impulses will have but little basis or force in his essential
								nature to keep his higher principles in <strong>devachan.</strong> About
								all he will have are those originated in childhood before he began
								to fix his thoughts on materialistic thinking.
							</p>
							<p>
								The thirst for
								life expressed by the word <strong>Tanha</strong> is the pulling or magnetic
								force lodged in the <strong>skandhas</strong> inherent in all beings.
								In such a case as this the average rule does not apply, since
								the whole effect either way is due to a balancing of forces and
								is the outcome of action and reaction. And this sort of materialistic
								thinker may emerge out of <strong>devachan</strong> into another body
								here in a month, allowing for the unexpended psychic forces originated
								in early life. But as every one of such persons varies as to class,
								intensity and quantity of thought and psychic impulse, each may
								vary in respect to the time of stay in <strong>devachan</strong>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Desperately
								materialistic thinkers will remain in the devachanic condition
								stupefied or asleep, as it were, as they have no forces in them
								appropriate to that state save in a very vague fashion, and for
								them it can be very truly said that there is no state after death
								so far as mind is concerned; they are torpid for a while, and
								then they live again on earth. This general average of the stay
								in <strong>devachan</strong> gives us the length of a very important human
								cycle, the Cycle of Reincarnation. For under that law national
								development will be found to repeat itself, and the times that
								are past will be found to come again.</p>
							<p>
								The last series of powerful and deeply imprinted thoughts are
								those which give color and trend to the whole life in <strong>devachan.
								</strong>The last moment will color each subsequent moment. On those
								the soul and mind fix themselves and weave of them a whole set
								of events and experiences, expanding them to their highest limit,
								carrying out all that was not possible in life. Thus expanding
								and weaving these thoughts the entity has its youth and growth
								and growing old, that is, the uprush of the force, its expansion,
								and its dying down to final exhaustion. If the person has led
								a colorless life the <strong>devachan</strong> will be colorless; if a
								rich life, then it will be rich in variety and effect.</p>

							<h4>
								Not a Dream
							</h4>
							<p>
								Existence
								there is not a dream, save in a conventional sense, for it is a
								stage of the life of man, and when we are there this present life
								is a dream. It is not in any sense monotonous. We are too prone
								to measure all possible states of life and places for experience
								by our present earthly one and to imagine it to be reality. But
								the life of the soul is endless and not to be stopped for one
								instant. Leaving our physical body is but a transition to another
								place or plane for living in.
							</p>
							<p>
								But as the ethereal garments of
								<strong>devachan</strong> are more lasting than those we wear here, the
								spiritual, moral, and psychic causes use more time in expanding
								and exhausting in that state than they do on earth. If the molecules
								that form the physical body were not subject to the general chemical
								laws that govern physical earth, then we should live as long in
								these bodies as we do in the devachanic state. But such a life
								of endless strain and suffering would be enough to blast the soul
								compelled to undergo it. Pleasure would then be pain, and surfeit
								would end but in an immortal insanity. Nature, always kind, leads
								us soon again into heaven for a rest, for the flowering of the
								best and highest in our natures.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Devachan</strong> is then neither meaningless nor useless.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								&quot;In it we are rested; that part of us which could not bloom under the chilling skies of earth-life bursts forth into flower and
								goes back with us to earth-life stronger and more a part of our
								nature than before. Why should we repine that Nature kindly aids
								us in the interminable struggle, why keep the mind revolving about
								the present petty personality and its good and evil fortunes?
								&quot; (Letter from Mahatma K. H. See <cite>Path</cite> p. 191,
								Vol. 5.)
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								But it is sometimes asked, what of those we have left behind:
								do we see them there? We do not see them there in fact, but we
								make to ourselves their images as full, complete, and objective
								as in life, and devoid of all that we then thought was a blemish.
								We live with them and see them grow great and good instead of
								mean or bad. The mother who has left a drunken son behind finds
								him before her in <strong>devachan</strong> a sober, good man, and likewise
								through all possible cases, parent, child, husband, and wife have
								their loved ones there perfect and full of knowledge. This is
								for the benefit of the soul. You may call it a delusion if you
								will, but the illusion is necessary to happiness just as it often
								is in life.
							</p>
							<p>
								And as it is the mind that makes the illusion, it
								is no cheat. Certainly the idea of a heaven built over the verge
								of hell where you must know, if any brains or memory are left
								to you under the modern orthodox scheme, that your erring friends
								and relatives are suffering eternal torture, will bear no comparison
								with the doctrine of <strong>devachan</strong>. But entities in <strong>devachan
								</strong>are not wholly devoid of power to help those left on earth.
								Love, the master of life, if real, pure, and deep, will sometimes
								cause the happy Ego in <strong>devachan</strong> to affect those left
								on earth for their good, not only in the moral field but also
								in that of material circumstance. This is possible under a law
								of the occult universe which cannot be explained now with profit,
								but the fact may be stated. It has been given out before this
								by H. P. Blavatsky, without, however, much attention being drawn
								to it.</p>
							<p>
								The last question to consider is whether we here can reach those
								in <strong>devachan</strong> or do they come here. We cannot reach them
								nor affect them unless we are Adepts. The claim of mediums to
								hold communion with the spirits of the dead is baseless, and still
								less valid is the claim of ability to help those who have gone
								to <strong>devachan.</strong> The Mahatma, a being who has developed all
								his powers and is free from illusion, can go into the devachanic
								state and then communicate with the Egos there. Such is one of
								their functions, and that is the only school of the Apostles after
								death. They deal with certain entities in <strong>devachan</strong> for
								the purpose of getting them out of the state so as to return to
								earth for the benefit of the race. The Egos they thus deal with
								are those whose nature is great and deep but who are not wise
								enough to be able to overcome the natural illusions of <strong>devachan</strong>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sometimes also the hypersensitive and pure medium goes into this
								state and then holds communication with the Egos there, but it
								is rare, and certainly will not take place with the general run
								of mediums who trade for money. But the soul never descends here
								to the medium. And the gulf between the consciousness of <strong>devachan
								</strong>and that of earth is so deep and wide that it is but seldom
								the medium can remember upon returning to recollection here what
								or whom it met or saw or heard in <strong>devachan</strong>. This gulf
								is similar to that which separates <strong>devachan</strong> from rebirth;
								it is one in which all memory of what preceded it is blotted out.</p>
							<p>
								The whole period allotted by the soul's forces being ended in
								<strong>devachan,</strong> the magnetic threads which bind it to earth
								begin to assert their power. The Self wakes from the dream, it
								is borne swiftly off to a new body, and then, just before birth,
								it sees for a moment all the causes that led it to <strong>devachan
								</strong>and back to the life it is about to begin, and knowing it
								to be all just, to be the result of its own past life, it repines
								not but takes up the cross again&mdash;and another soul has come
								back to earth.
