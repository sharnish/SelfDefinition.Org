								Let us now consider the states of man after the death of the body
								and before birth, having looked over the whole field of the evolution
								of things and beings in a general way. This brings up at once
								the questions: Is there any heaven or hell, and what are they?
								Are they states or places? Is there a spot in space where they
								may be found and to which we go or from where we come? We must
								also go back to the subject of the fourth principle of the constitution
								of man, that called Kama in Sanskrit and desire or passion in
								English.
							</p>
							<p>
								Bearing in mind what was said about that principle, and
								also the teaching in respect to the astral body and the Astral
								Light, it will be easier to understand what is taught about the
								two states <em>ante</em> and <em>post mortem. </em>In chronological
								order we go into kama loka&mdash;or the plane of desire&mdash;first
								on the demise of the body, and then the higher principles, the
								real man, fall into the state of <em>Devachan. </em>After dealing
								with kama loka it will be more easy to study the question of <em>Devachan.</em>

							</p>
							<p>
								The breath leaves the body and we say the man is dead, but that
								is only the beginning of death; it proceeds on other planes. When
								the frame is cold and eyes closed, all the forces of the body
								and mind rush through the brain, and by a series of pictures the
								whole life just ended is imprinted indelibly on the inner man
								not only in a general outline but down to the smallest detail
								of even the most minute and fleeting impression. At this moment,
								though every indication leads the physician to pronounce for death
								and though to all intents and purposes the person is dead to this
								life, the real man is busy in the brain, and not until his work
								there is ended is the person gone. When this solemn work is over
								the astral body detaches itself from the physical, and, life energy
								having departed, the remaining five principles are in the plane
								of kama loka.

							<h4>
								Three Parts
							</h4>
							<p>
								The natural separation of the principles brought about by death
								divides the total man into three parts:
							</p>
							<ul class="generic-no-bullet">
								<li><em>First</em>, the visible body with all its elements left
									to further disintegration on the earth plane, where all that it
									is composed of is in time resolved into the different physical
									departments of nature.
								</li>
								<li><em>Second,</em> the <em> kama rupa </em>made up of the astral
									body and the passions and desires, which also begins at once to
									go to pieces on the astral plane;
								</li>
								<li><em>Third,</em> the real man, the upper triad of <em>Atma-Buddhi-Manas,
									</em>deathless but now out of earth conditions, devoid of body,
									begins in <em>devachan </em>to function solely as mind clothed
									in a very ethereal vesture which it will shake off when the time
									comes for it to return to earth.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								<em>Kama loka</em>&mdash;or the place of desire&mdash;is the astral
								region penetrating and surrounding the earth. As a place it is
								on and in and about the earth. Its extent is to a measurable distance
								from the earth, but the ordinary laws obtaining here do not obtain
								there, and entities therein are not under the same conditions
								as to space and time as we are. As a state it is metaphysical,
								though that metaphysic relates to the astral plane. It is called
								the plane of desire because it relates to the fourth principle,
								and in it the ruling force is desire devoid of and divorced from
								intelligence. It is an astral sphere intermediate between earthly
								and heavenly life. Beyond any doubt it is the origin of the Christian
								theory of purgatory, where the soul undergoes penance for evil
								done and from which it can be released by prayer and other ceremonies
								or offerings.
							</p>
							<p>
								The fact underlying this superstition is that the
								soul may be detained in <em>kama</em> <em>loka </em>by the enormous
								force of some unsatisfied desire, and cannot get rid of the astral
								and kamic clothing until that desire is satisfied by some one
								on earth or by the soul itself. But if the person was pure minded
								and of high aspirations, the separation of the principles on that
								plane is soon completed, permitting the higher triad to go into
								<em>Devachan. </em>Being the purely astral sphere, it partakes
								of the nature of the astral matter which is essentially earthly
								and devilish, and in it all the forces work undirected by soul
								or conscience. It is the slag-pit, as it were, of the great furnace
								of life, where nature provides for the sloughing off of elements
								which have no place in <em>Devachan, </em>and for that reason
								it must have many degrees, every one of which was noted by the
								ancients. These degrees are known in Sanskrit as <em>lokas</em>
								or places in a metaphysical sense.
							</p>
							<p>
								Human life is very varied as
								to character and other potentialities, and for each of these the
								appropriate place after death is provided, thus making <em>kama
									loka </em>an infinitely varied sphere. In life some of the differences
								among men are modified and some inhibited by a similarity of body
								and heredity, but in <em>kama</em> <em>loka </em>all the hidden
								desires and passions are let loose in consequence of the absence
								of body, and for that reason the state is vastly more diversified
								than the life plane. Not only is it necessary to provide for the
								natural varieties and differences, but also for those caused by
								the manner of death, about which something shall be said. And
								all these various divisions are but the natural result of the
								life thoughts and last thoughts of the persons who die on earth.
								It is beyond the scope of this work to go into a description of
								all these degrees, inasmuch as volumes would be needed to describe
								them, and then but few would understand.

							<h4>
								The Fourth Principle
							</h4>
							<p>
								To deal with <em>kama loka </em>compels us to deal also with the
								fourth principle in the classification of man's constitution,
								and arouses a conflict with modern ideas and education on the
								subject of the desires and passions. It is generally supposed
								that the desires and passions are inherent tendencies in the individual,
								and they have an altogether unreal and misty appearance for the
								ordinary student. But in this system of philosophy they are not
								merely inherent in the individual nor are they due to the body
								<em>per se. </em>While the man is living in the world the desires
								and passions&mdash;the principle <em>kama</em>&mdash;have no separate
								life apart from the astral and inner man, being, so to say, diffused
								throughout his being. But as they coalesce with the astral body
								after death and thus form an entity with its own term of life,
								though without soul, very important questions arise.
							</p>
							<p>
								During mortal
								life the desires and passions are guided by the mind and soul;
								after death they work without guidance from the former master;
								while we live we are responsible for them and their effects, and
								when we have left this life we are still responsible, although
								they go on working and making effects on others while they last
								as the sort of entity I have described, and without our direct
								guidance. In this is seen the continuance of responsibility. They
								are a portion of the <em>skandhas</em>&mdash;well known in eastern
								philosophy&mdash;which are the aggregates that make up the man. The
								body includes one set of the <em>skandhas, </em>the astral man
								another, the <em>kama</em> principle is another set, and still
								others pertain to other parts.
							</p>
							<p>
								In <em>kama</em> are the really
								active and important ones which control rebirths and lead to all
								the varieties of life and circumstance upon each rebirth. They
								are being made from day to day under the law that every thought
								combines instantly with one of the elemental forces of nature,
								becoming to that extent an entity which will endure in accordance
								with the strength of the thought as it leaves the brain, and all
								of these are inseparably connected with the being who evolved
								them. There is no way of escaping; all we can do is to have thoughts
								of good quality, for the highest of the Masters themselves are
								not exempt from this law, but they "people their current
								in space" with entities powerful for good alone.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now in <em>kama loka </em>this mass of desire and thought exists
								very definitely until the conclusion of its disintegration, and
								then the remainder consists of the essence of these <em>skandhas,
								</em>connected, of course, with the being that evolved and had
								them. They can no more be done away with than we can blot out
								the universe. Hence they are said to remain until the being comes
								out of <em>devachan, </em>and then at once by the law of attraction
								they are drawn to the being, who from them as germ or basis builds
								up a new set of <em>skandhas </em>for the new life. <em>Kama loka
								</em>therefore is distinguished from the earth plane by reason
								of the existence therein, uncontrolled and unguided, of the mass
								of passions and desires; but at the same time earth-life is also
								a <em>kama loka, </em>since it is largely governed by the principle
								<em>kama</em>, and will be so until at a far distant time in the
								course of evolution the races of men shall have developed the
								fifth and sixth principle,<sup>[1]</sup> thus throwing <em>kama</em> into its
								own sphere and freeing earth-life from its influence.
							</p>
							<p class="fnote">
								[1. 4th principle is Kama, 5th is Manas, 6th is Buddhi.]
							</p>
							<p>
								The astral man in <em>kama loka </em>is a mere shell devoid of
								soul and mind, without conscience and also unable to act unless
								vivified by forces outside of itself. It has that which seems
								like an animal or automatic consciousness due wholly to the very
								recent association with the human Ego. For under the principle
								laid down in another chapter, every atom going to make up the
								man has a memory of its own which is capable of lasting a length
								of time in proportion to the force given it. In the case of a
								very material and gross or selfish person the force lasts longer
								than in any other, and hence in that case the automatic consciousness
								will be more definite and bewildering to one who without knowledge
								dabbles with necromancy. Its purely astral portion contains and
								carries the record of all that ever passed before the person when
								living, for one of the qualities of the astral substance is to
								absorb all scenes and pictures and the impressions of all thoughts,
								to keep them, and to throw them forth by reflection when the conditions
								permit.
							</p>
							<p>
								This astral shell, cast off by every man at death, would
								be a menace to all men were it not in every case&mdash;except one which
								shall be mentioned&mdash;devoid of all the higher principles which
								are the directors. But those guiding constituents being disjoined
								from the shell, it wavers and floats about from place to place
								without any will of its own, but governed wholly by attractions
								in the astral and magnetic fields.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is possible for the real man&mdash;called the spirit by
								some&mdash;to communicate with us immediately after death for a few brief
								moments, but, those passed, the soul has no more to do with earth
								until reincarnated. What can and do influence the sensitive and
								the medium from out of this sphere are the shells I have described.
								Soulless and conscienceless, these in no sense are the spirits
								of our deceased ones. They are the clothing thrown off by the
								inner man, the brutal earthly portion discarded in the flight
								to <em>devachan, </em>and so have always been considered by the
								ancients as devils&mdash;our personal devils&mdash;because essentially
								astral, earthly, and passional. It would be strange indeed if
								this shell, after being for so long the vehicle of the real man
								on earth, did not retain an automatic memory and consciousness.
								We see the decapitated body of the frog or the cock moving and
								acting for a time with a seeming intelligence, and why is it not
								possible for the finer and more subtle astral form to act and
								move with a far greater amount of seeming mental direction?

							<h4>
								Elementals
							</h4>
							<p>
								Existing in the sphere of <em>kama loka, </em>as, indeed, also
								in all parts of the globe and the solar system, are the elementals
								or nature forces. They are innumerable, and their divisions are
								almost infinite, as they are, in a sense, the nerves of nature.
								Each class has its own work just as has every natural element
								or thing. As fire burns and as water runs down and not up under
								their general law, so the elementals act under law, but being
								higher in the scale than gross fire or water their action seems
								guided by mind. Some of them have a special relation to mental
								operations and to the action of the astral organs, whether these
								be joined to a body or not.
							</p>
							<p>
								When a medium forms the channel, and
								also from other natural coordination, these elementals make an
								artificial connection with the shell of a deceased person, aided
								by the nervous fluid of the medium and others near, and then the
								shell is galvanized into an artificial life. Through the medium
								connection is made with the physical and psychical forces of all
								present. The old impressions on the astral body give up their
								images to the mind of the medium, the old passions are set on
								fire. Various messages and reports are then obtained from it,
								but not one of them is original, not one is from the spirit. By
								their strangeness, and in consequence of the ignorance of those
								who dabble in it, this is mistaken for the work of spirit, but
								it is all from the living when it is not the mere picking out
								from the astral light of the images of what has been in the past.
								In certain cases to be noted there is an intelligence at work
								that is wholly and intensely bad, to which every medium is subject,
								and which will explain why so many of them have succumbed to evil,
								as they have confessed.

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="shells">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4>
								Shells
							</h4>

							<p>
								A rough classification of these shells that visit mediums would
								be as follows:
							</p>
							<p>
								(1) Those of the recently deceased whose place of burial is not
								far away. This class will be quite coherent in accordance with
								the life and thought of the former owner. An unmaterial, good,
								and spiritualized person leaves a shell that will soon disintegrate.
								A gross, mean, selfish, material person's shell will be heavy,
								consistent, and long lived; and so on with all varieties.
							</p>
							<p>
								(2) Those of persons who had died far away from the place where
								the medium is. Lapse of time permits such to escape from the vicinity
								of their old bodies, and at the same time brings on a greater
								degree of disintegration which corresponds on the astral plane
								to putrefaction on the physical. These are vague, shadowy, incoherent;
								respond but briefly to the psychic stimulus, and are whirled off
								by any magnetic current. They are galvanized for a moment by the
								astral currents of the medium and of those persons present who
								were related to the deceased.
							</p>
							<p>
								(3) Purely shadowy remains which can hardly be given a place.
								There is no English to describe them, though they are facts in
								this sphere. They might be said to be the mere mold or impress
								left in the astral substance by the once coherent shell long since
								disintegrated. They are therefore so near being fictitious as
								to almost deserve the designation. As such shadowy photographs
								they are enlarged, decorated, and given an imaginary life by the
								thoughts, desires, hopes, and imaginings of medium and sitters
								at the <em>seance.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								(4) Definite, coherent entities, human souls bereft of the spiritual
								tie, now tending down to the worst state of all, <em>avitchi,
								</em>where annihilation of the personality is the end. They are
								known as black magicians. Having centered the consciousness in
								the principle of <em>kama</em>, preserved intellect, divorced
								themselves from spirit, they are the only damned beings we know.
								In life they had human bodies and reached their awful state by
								persistent lives of evil for its own sake; some of such already
								doomed to become what I have described, are among us on earth
								today. These are not ordinary shells, for they have centered all
								their force in <em>kama, </em>thrown out every spark of good thought
								or aspiration, and have a complete mastery of the astral sphere.
								I put them in the classification of shells because they are such
								in the sense that they are doomed to disintegration consciously
								as the others are to the same end mechanically only. They may
								and do last for many centuries, gratifying their lusts through
								any sensitive they can lay hold of where bad thought gives them
								an opening. They preside at nearly all <em>seances, </em>assuming
								high names and taking the direction so as to keep the control
								and continue the delusion of the medium, thus enabling themselves
								to have a convenient channel for their own evil purposes. Indeed,
								with the shells of suicides, of those poor wretches who die at
								the hand of the law, of drunkards and gluttons, these black magicians
								living in the astral world hold the field of physical mediumship
								and are liable to invade the sphere of any medium no matter how
								good. The door once open, it is open to all. This class of shell
								has lost higher <em>manas, </em>but in the struggle not only after
								death but as well in life the lower portion of <em>manas </em>which
								should have been raised up to godlike excellence was torn away
								from its lord and now gives this entity intelligence which is
								devoid of spirit but power to suffer as it will when its final
								day shall come.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the state of <em>Kama Loka </em>suicides and those who are
								suddenly shot out of life by accident or murder, legal or illegal,
								pass a term almost equal to the length life would have been but
								for the sudden termination. These are not really dead. To bring
								on a normal death, a factor not recognized by medical science
								must be present. That is, the principles of the being as described
								in other chapters have their own term of cohesion, at the natural
								end of which they separate from each other under their own laws.
								This involves the great subject of the cohesive forces of the
								human subject, requiring a book in itself. I must be content therefore
								with the assertion that this law of cohesion obtains among the
								human principles. Before that natural end the principles are unable
								to separate. Obviously the normal destruction of the cohesive
								force cannot be brought about by mechanical processes except in
								respect to the physical body. Hence a suicide, or person killed
								by accident or murdered by man or by order of human law, has not
								come to the natural termination of the cohesion among the other
								constituents, and is hurled into the <em>kama loka </em>state
								only partly dead. There the remaining principles have to wait
								until the actual natural life term is reached, whether it be one
								month or sixty years.
							</p>
							<p>
								But the degrees of <em>kama loka </em>provide for the many varieties
								of the last-mentioned shells. Some pass the period in great suffering,
								others in a dreamy sort of sleep, each according to the moral
								responsibility. But executed criminals are in general thrown out
								of life full of hate and revenge, smarting under a penalty they
								do not admit the justice of. They are ever rehearsing in <em>kama
									loka </em>their crime, their trial, their execution, and their
								revenge. And whenever they can gain touch with a sensitive living
								person, medium or not, they attempt to inject thoughts of murder
								and other crime into the brain of such unfortunate. And that they
								succeed in such attempts the deeper students of Theosophy full
								well know.
							</p>
							<p>
								We have now approached <em>devachan</em>. After a certain time
								in <em>kama loka </em>the being falls into a state of unconsciousness
								which precedes the change into the next state. It is like the
								birth into life, preluded by a term of darkness and heavy sleep.
								It then wakes to the joys of <em>devachan.</em>
