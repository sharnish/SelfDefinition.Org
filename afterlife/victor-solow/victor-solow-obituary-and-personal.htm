                                The reason for the interest in Mr. Solow's personal life has to do with recurring questions that those on a spiritual path struggle with, such as:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="question-list">
                                <li>What kind of a person can have a spiritual experience? </li>
                                <li>What is necessary? Are many years of spiritual discipline required?</li>
                                <li>Why do some people yearn for a profound experience but remain unsatisfied, while others receive illumination seemingly &quot;by grace&quot; without rhyme or reason? </li>
                                <li>Is there hope <em>for me</em> at death if I do not experience my essence during my life?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We will have to let the reader decide in this case. No conclusion is ventured about Victor Solow as there is no mention in the information gleaned so far with regard to his possible spiritual aspirations. He obviously had an active professional and personal life and was certainly not living like a monk in seclusion. But it can be inferred that because of the traumas suffered by his family members in wartime Germany [blog post below], his immigration to the US in 1939 at the age of 18, and his <a href="victor-solow-wartime-service.htm">wartime service in Burma as a photographer</a> that Victor's life was not ordinary, and he was acquainted with its transitory nature, having observed the death that surrounded him before and during the war.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mr. Solow had the death/after-death experience (March 25, 1974) recounted in the newspaper articles at the age of 56. He passed away at the age of 59 according to his obituary, dated January 1977. A family blog post (1st post) about Victor and his father (2nd post) gives his date of birth of October 6th, 1917, confirming the age given in the obit. The family blog say Victor immigrated to the US in 1935 at the age of 18, additional confirmation.

                                We are specially interested in any information regarding Mr. Solow's spiritual life. It is known is that he was Jewish, the consequences of which led to persecution of his family members in Europe and his subsequent immigration to the US.

A paragraph reproduced below ties him to the other articles. In the family blog post there is no mention of the "after-death" experience or the Readers' Digest article. The family says Victor died in 1976, although the NY Times obit dated Sunday, Jan. 16, 1977 says he died the previous Sunday.

                                        <strong>Natan and Dora</strong> [Victor's parents] lived in Warsaw with Anatole [Victor's brother] and escaped to Russia when the first World War started. Natan extended his business and they lived in Moscow in luxury. Natan traveled a great deal on business. Dora spent most of her summers abroad with Tolya and Natan&apos;s niece Janka and her husband, Misch.

                                        <strong>Vitya David (Victor)</strong> was born in Moscow on October 6th, 1917, with the first signs of the Russian revolution. The family emigrated to Berlin, where they lived in a lovely townhouse, which was later confiscated by the Germans.

                                        In the years preceding the war, the family dispersed. Anatole left for England in XX <span class="note">[apparently a date placeholder]</span> to pursue a master's degree, emigrating to the U.S. in 1939. Eighteen-year-old Victor was sent by his mother to the U.S. in 1935 to live with his uncle Naftal in New York City until he could make his own way. In 1938, Dora left Berlin through France, and once she gained safe passage for herself, in 1942, Dora followed her boys to the U.S.

                                        By some quirk of fate, Natan was cut off from his family and caught by the Nazis and ended his life in utter poverty and hunger of cancer in Warsaw&apos;s ghetto.</p>

                                The question of what happens to the individual after death is the subject explored in &quot;Beyond and Back&quot;, opening Wednesday at the Sierra Theater for a limited engagement.

                                In &quot;Beyond and Back&quot; a man who was declared dead for 28 minutes [23 minutes], Victor Solow of New York City, tells in his own words what he experienced during that time. It was, for him, an altogether pleasant experience.
