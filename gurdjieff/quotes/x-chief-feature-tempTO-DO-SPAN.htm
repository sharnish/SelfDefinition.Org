                                "Taken in itself, a man's being has many different sides. The most characteristic feature of a modem man is the absence of unity in him and, further, the absence in him of even traces of those properties which he most likes to ascribe to himself, that is, 'lucid consciousness,' 'free will,' a 'permanent ego or I,' and the 'ability to do.' It may surprise you if I say that the chief feature of a modem man's being which explains everything else that is lacking in him is sleep.

                                "A modern man lives in sleep, in sleep he is born and in sleep he dies. About sleep, its significance and its role in life, we will speak later. But at present just think of one thing, what knowledge can a sleeping man have? And if you think about it and at the same time remember that sleep is the chief feature of our being, it will at once become clear to you that if a man really wants knowledge, he must first of all think about how to wake, that is, about how to change his being.

                                "Besides these general rules there are certain individual conditions which are given to each person separately and which are generally connected with his 'chief fault,' or chief feature.</p>

                                "Every man. has a certain feature in his character which is central. It is like an axle round which all his 'false personality' revolves. Every man's personal work must consist in struggling against this chief fault. This explains why there can be no general rules of work and why all systems that attempt to evolve such rules either lead to nothing or cause harm. How can there be general rules? What is useful for one is harmful for another. One man talks too much; he must learn to keep silent. Another man is silent when he ought to talk and he must learn to talk; and so it is always and in everything. General rules for the work of groups refer to everyone. Personal directions can only be individual. In this connection again a man cannot find his own chief feature, his chief fault, by himself. This is practically a law. The teacher has to point out this feature to him and show him how to fight against it. No one else but the teacher can do this.

This aim is the realization of one's nothingness. Only when a man has truly and sincerely arrived at the conviction of his own helplessness and nothingness and only when he feels it constantly, will he be ready for the next and much more difficult stages of the work.

                                "The struggle against the 'false I,' against one's chief feature or chief fault, is the most important part of the work, and it must proceed in deeds, not in words. For this purpose the teacher gives each man definite tasks which require, in order to carry them out, the conquest of his chief feature. When a man carries out these tasks he struggles with himself, works on himself. If he avoids the tasks, tries not to carry them out, it means that either he does not want to or that he cannot work.

If he sees that he is understood and that the tasks are carried out he passes on to more and more difficult ones.

                                G. was very ingenious in the definition of features. I realized on this occasion that not everyone's chief feature could be defined. With some people this feature can be so hidden beneath different formal manifestations as to be almost impossible to find. And then a man can consider himself as his chief feature just as I could call my chief feature "Ouspensky" or, as G. always called it, "Piotr Demianovich." Mistakes there cannot be because the "Piotr Demianovich" of each person forms so to speak "round his chief feature." Whenever anyone disagreed with the definition of his chief feature given by G. he always said that the fact that the person disagreed with him showed that he was right.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I disagree only with what you say is actually my chief feature," said one of our people. "The chief feature which I know in myself is very much worse. But I do not dispute that people may see me as you describe."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "You know nothing in yourself," G. told him; "if you knew you would not have that feature. And people certainly see you in the way I told you. But you do not see how they see you. If you accept what I told you as your chief feature you will understand how people see you. And if you find a way to struggle with this feature and to destroy it, that is, to destroy its involuntary manifestation" (G. emphasized these words), "you will produce on people not the impression that you do now but any impression you like."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With this began long talks about the impressions that a man produces on other people and how he can produce a desirable or an undesirable impression. Those around him see a man's chief feature however hidden it may be. Of course they cannot always define it. But their definitions are often very good and very near. Take nicknames. Nicknames sometimes define chief features very well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The talk about impressions brought us once more to "inner" and "outward considering."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "There cannot be proper outward considering while a man is seated in his chief feature," said G. "For instance So-and-So" (he named one of our party). "His feature is that he is never at home. How can he consider anything or anybody?" I was astonished at the artistic finish of the feature that was represented by G. It was not psychology even, it was art.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "And psychology ought to be art," G. replied, "psychology can never be simply a science." To another of our party he said on the question of feature that his feature was that he did not exist at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "You understand, I do not see you," said G. "It does not mean that
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                you are always like that. But when you are like you are now, you do not exist at all." He said to another that his chief feature was a tendency always to argue with everybody about everything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "But then I never argue," the man very heatedly at once replied.

                                G. told another of our party—it was the middle-aged man on whom he had carried out the experiment of dividing personality from essence and who asked for raspberry jam—that his feature was that he had no conscience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The following day the man came and said that he had been in the public library and had looked through the encyclopedic dictionaries of four languages for the meaning of the word "conscience."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                G. merely waved his hand.

                                To the other man, his companion in the experiment, G. said that he had no shame, and he at once cracked a rather amusing joke against himself.

                                A. All that you have learnt, all that you have heard about the possibility of development, all refers to being. First of all, development of being means awakening, since the chief feature of our being is that we are asleep. By trying to awake we change our being; this is the first point. Then there are many other things: creating unity, not expressing negative emotions, observation, study of negative emotions, trying not to identify, trying to avoid useless talk—all this is work on being. It is true that in this way you acquire certain knowledge, but if it is simply intellectual knowledge it is put separately. Being is power, power to 'do', and power to 'do' is power to be different.

                                Until now, when we spoke about man, we spoke about general human features common to all people. But at a certain moment in the work, besides understanding the general principles, one must try to find one's own peculiarities, for one cannot know oneself for practical purposes if one only knows the general characteristics.

                                Each man has his own individual features, his own weaknesses when he is unable to resist things that happen. These features or weaknesses may be very simple or very complicated. One man may be able to resist everything except good food; another all except talk, or he may be lazy, or too active. It is very important at a certain stage of self-study to find one's chief feature, which means chief weakness. People's chief weaknesses are very different, and if we can resist something that another man cannot resist because it happens to be his chief feature, this difference in weaknesses gives us the illusion that we can 'do'. Chief feature or chief weakness is in false personality. In some cases it is possible to see definitely one, two or three features or tendencies, often linked together, which come into everything like an axis round which everything turns. This is chief feature. Sometimes it is very clear and apparent, but sometimes it is difficult to describe. Our language has often no words, no forms to describe it and it can only be indicated in a roundabout way. It is interesting that one can hardly ever find one's own chief feature, because one is in it, and if one is told, one usually does not believe it. But we can find what stands side by side with it, although it is not it.

                                It is sometimes useful to collect opinions of friends about oneself, for this often helps in discovering one's features. It is very important to find out what creates obstacles to our work. Until one has found it, a chief feature means constant loss of energy, so we must find this leak and stop it. Q. Can one ever find the chief feature by oneself?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. At a certain moment in organized work it will come out, or you may be told. But if you are told, you will not believe it. Or sometimes it is so obvious that it is impossible to deny it, but with the help of buffers one can forget it again. I have known people who gave a name to their chief feature and for some time remembered it, and then forgot. You must come near to it yourself. When you feel it yourself, you will know. If you are only told, you may easily forget. When you find many manifestations of your false personality, you may find your feature.

                                Q. Is it what you call a buffer?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. No, but buffers hide the chief feature; it is helped by buffers.

                                Q. If we find out our chief features, can we correct them? You said we cannot change anything.

                                Q. Having observed a certain tendency in oneself, one decides that it shall not happen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. Usually after one has decided it still goes on happening. Or if it docs not happen, generally another tendency appears in its place. As a rule only one thing stops things— fear.

                                Q. Do chief features vary during life?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. If they are clearly delineated, they go on throughout the whole life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q. Yet I can see things that I had that do not exist now.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. Possibly. Our knowledge of ourselves is very defective. One can observe many things in life and make great mistakes, if one does not know how to verify. And generally, as I said, it is difficult to see chief feature.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q. Could you tell me what my chief feature is?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. I do not think so. You see, this is not necessary for starting to work. In the beginning, what is important is not the chief feature itself but what is produced by it, and that you can study in the form of attitudes. We do not know our attitudes because we have never thought about ourselves in the right way. We have too many imaginary ideas. What we must study now is all our points of view, habitual emotions, the way we think, what we invent. These are all results of chief feature or chief features, for there may be two or three features which are the most important, not necessarily only one. Think about false personality; this is quite sufficient for practical purposes. As a theory, false personality in most cases turns round one axle and that axle is chief feature. If a man has one big weakness, from one point of view it is an advantage, because if he can conquer this feature or weakness he can in one stride achieve many things. It is an advantage when things are concentrated, many things coming together at one point. Then efforts at this point produce better results than if one works at different points. But chief feature is not always definable. Sometimes you can put your finger on it, sometimes not; in one person you can see it, in another not. But false personality you can see.

                            <p>
                                Q. Is chief feature a food for false personality?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. Chief feature is not food. It is false personality; it is something on which false personality is based and which enters into everything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Q. Does chief feature always make decisions at important moments?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. This is the best definition for it—that it always makes decisions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                p 186
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In connection with chief feature, it is better to think first on general lines—why you came to the system, what you want from the system. It often happens that people come to lectures for years and forget why they came. If you remember why you came, the system can answer your questions, but not without that. You may not remember about mechanicalness; you may forget about the very keen conviction in every person that he can 'do', and that if he cannot it is because he did not think about it or did not wish to. It is necessary to struggle with this idea, and understand that we are mechanical, that we can do nothing, that we are asleep, that we have many 'I's—all these things. This will help you to see false personality, for all these things we ascribe to ourselves are standard examples of imagination. And imaginary personality, or false personality, is chief feature for everybody. Q. Is false personality always selfish?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. If you think of yourself as false personality and try to find what is not, you may be fairly sure that all that is selfish is false personality. But the more you think about it, the less you will see it. It may appear very unselfish, and that is the worst of all!

                            <p>
                                Q. Are there many varieties of chief feature?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. There are strange varieties and there are classical ones. One very common feature, described in many places in the New Testament, is when we see other people's faults but not our own. Then certain kinds of self-pity are very common. And there are also curious combinations for which it is sometimes difficult to find a psychological definition.

                                Q. If a man sets an ideal for himself of how he ought to behave, would this not be what is meant by 'doing'?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A. The question is whether he can do it and whether he does it, because to make plans, to have ideals is one thing and to do it is another thing. It may be just good intentions. One of the chief features of our being is that we cannot do what we decide.</p>
