                                    Tzu-ch'i of South Wall sat leaning on his armrest, staring up at the sky and breathing&mdash;vacant
                                    and far away, as though he'd lost his companion [body]. Yen Ch'eng Tzu-yu, who was
                                    standing by his side in attendance, said, "What is this? Can you really make the
                                    body like a withered tree and the mind like dead ashes? The man leaning on the armrest
                                    now is not the one who leaned on it before!"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tzu-ch'i said, "You do well to ask the question, Yen. Now I have lost myself. Do
                                    you understand that? You hear the piping of men, but you haven't heard the piping
                                    of earth. Or if you've heard the piping of earth, you haven't heard the piping of
                                    Heaven!"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tzu-yu said, "May I venture to ask what this means?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tzu-ch'i said, "The Great Clod belches out breath and its name is wind. So long
                                    as it doesn't come forth, nothing happens. But when it does, then ten thousand hollows
                                    begin crying wildly. Can't you hear them, long and drawn out? In the mountain forests
                                    that lash and sway, there are huge trees a hundred spans around with hollows and
                                    openings like noses, like mouths, like ears, like jugs, like cups, like mortars,
                                    like rifts, like ruts. They roar like waves, whistle like arrows, screech, gasp,
                                    cry, wail, moan, and howl, those in the lead calling out yeee!, those behind calling
                                    out yuuu! In a gentle breeze answer faintly, but in a full gale the chorus is gigantic.
                                    And when the fierce wind has passed on, then all the hollows are empty again. Have
                                    you never seen the tossing and trembling that goes on?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tzu-yu said, "By the piping of earth, then, you mean simply [the sound of] these
                                    hollows, and by the piping of man [the sound of] flutes and whistles. But may I
                                    ask about the piping of Heaven?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tzu-ch'i said, "Blowing on the ten thousand things in a different way, so that each
                                    can be itself&mdash;all take what they want for themselves, but who does the sounding?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Great understanding is broad and unhurried; little understanding is cramped and
                                    busy. Great words are clear and limpid; little words are shrill and quarrelsome.
                                    In sleep, men's spirits go visiting; in waking hours, their bodies hustle. With
                                    everything they meet they become entangled. Day after day they use their minds in
                                    strife, sometimes grandiose, sometimes sly, sometimes petty. Their little fears
                                    are mean and trembly; their great fears are stunned and overwhelming. They bound
                                    off like an arrow or a crossbow pellet, certain that they are the arbiters of right
                                    and wrong. They cling to their position as though they had sworn before the gods,
                                    sure that they are holding on to victory. They fade like fall and winter&mdash;such is
                                    the way they dwindle day by day. They drown in what they do&mdash;you cannot make them
                                    turn back. They grow dark, as though sealed with seals&mdash;such are the excesses of
                                    their old age. And when their minds draw near to death, nothing can restore them
                                    to the light.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Joy, anger, grief, delight, worry, regret, fickleness, inflexibility, modesty, willfulness,
                                    candor, insolence&mdash;music from empty holes, mushrooms springing up in dampness, day
                                    and night replacing each other before us, and no one knows where they sprout from.
                                    Let it be! Let it be! [It is enough that] morning and evening we have them, and
                                    they are the means by which we live. Without them we would not exist; without us
                                    they would have nothing to take hold of. This comes close to the matter. But I do
                                    not know what makes them the way they are. It would seem as though they have some
                                    True Master, and yet I find no trace of him. He can act&mdash;that is certain. Yet I
                                    cannot see his form. He has identity but no form.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The hundred joints, the nine openings, the six organs, all come together and exist
                                    here [as my body]. But which part should I feel closest to? I should delight in
                                    all parts, you say? But there must be one I ought to favor more. If not, are they
                                    all of them mere servants? But if they are all servants, then how can they keep
                                    order among themselves? Or do they take turns being lord and servant? It would seem
                                    as though there must be some True Lord among them. But whether I succeed in discovering
                                    his identity or not, it neither adds to nor detracts from his Truth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once a man receives this fixed bodily form, he holds on to it, waiting for the end.
                                    Sometimes clashing with things, sometimes bending before them, he runs his course
                                    like a galloping steed, and nothing can stop him. Is he not pathetic? Sweating and
                                    laboring to the end of his days and never seeing his accomplishment, utterly exhausting
                                    himself and never knowing where to look for rest&mdash;can you help pitying him? I'm
                                    not dead yet! he says, but what good is that? His body decays, his mind follows
                                    it&mdash;can you deny that this is a great sorrow? Man's life has always been a muddle
                                    like this. How could I be the only muddled one, and other men not muddled?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If a man follows the mind given him and makes it his teacher, then who can be without
                                    a teacher? Why must you comprehend the process of change and form your mind on that
                                    basis before you can have a teacher? Even an idiot has his teacher. But to fail
                                    to abide by this mind and still insist upon your rights and wrongs&mdash;this is like
                                    saying that you set off for Yueh today and got there yesterday. This is to claim
                                    that what doesn't exist exists. If you claim that what doesn't exist exists, then
                                    even the holy sage Yu couldn't understand you, much less a person like me!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Words are not just wind. Words have something to say. But if what they have to say
                                    is not fixed, then do they really say something? Or do they say nothing? People
                                    suppose that words are different from the peeps of baby birds, but is there a difference
                                    or isn't there? What does the Way rely upon, that we have true and false? What do
                                    words rely upon, that we have right and wrong? How can the Way go away and not exist?
                                    How can word exist and not be acceptable? When the Way relies on little accomplishments
                                    and words rely on vain show, then we have the rights and wrongs of the Confucians
                                    and the Mo-ists. What one calls right the other calls wrong; what one calls wrong
                                    the other calls right. But if we want to right their wrongs and wrong their rights,
                                    then the best thing to use is clarity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Everything has its "that," everything has its "this." From the point of view of
                                    "that" you cannot see it, but through understanding you can know it. So I say, "that"
                                    comes out of "this" and "this depends on "that"&mdash;which is to say that "this" and
                                    "that" give birth to each other. But where there is birth there must be death; where
                                    there is death there must be birth. Where there is acceptability there must be unacceptability;
                                    there there is unacceptability there must be acceptability. Where there is recognition
                                    of right there must be recognition of wrong; where there is recognition of wrong
                                    there must be recognition of right. Therefore the sage does not proceed in such
                                    a way, but illuminates all in the light of Heaven. He too recognizes a "this," but
                                    a "this" which is also "that," a "that" which is also "this." His "that" has both
                                    a right and a wrong to it; his "this" too as both a right and a wrong to it. So,
                                    in fact, does he still have a "this" and "that"? A state in which "this" and "that"
                                    no longer find their opposites is called the hinge of the Way. When the hinge is
                                    fitted into the socket, it can respond endlessly. It's right then is a single endlessness
                                    and its wrong too is a single endlessness. So I say, the best thing to use is clarity.

                                    To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as
                                    using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse
                                    to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show
                                    that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand
                                    things are one horse.

                                    What is acceptable we call acceptable; what is unacceptable we call unacceptable.
                                    A road is made by people walking on it; things are so because they are called so.
                                    What makes them so? Making them so makes them so. What makes them not so? Making
                                    them not so makes them not so. Things all must have that which is so; things all
                                    must have that which is acceptable. There is nothing that is not so, nothing that
                                    is not acceptable.
                                </p>

                                    For this reason, whether you point to a little stalk or a great pillar, a leper
                                    or the beautiful Hsi-shih, things ribald and shady or things grotesque and strange,
                                    the Way makes them all into one. Their dividedness is their completeness; their
                                    completeness is their impairment. No thing is either complete or impaired, but all
                                    are made into one again. Only the man of far-reaching vision knows how to make them
                                    into one. So he has no use [for categories], but relegates all to the constant.
                                    The constant is the useful; the useful is passable; the passable is the successful;
                                    and with success, all is accomplished. He relies upon this alone, relies upon it
                                    and does not know his is doing so. This is called the Way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To wear out your brain trying to make things into one without realizing that they
                                    are all the same&mdash;this is called "three in the morning." What do I mean by "three
                                    in the morning"? When the monkey trainer was handing out acorns, he said, "You get
                                    three in the morning and four at night." This made all the monkeys furious. "Well,
                                    then," he said, "you get four in the morning and three at night." The monkeys were
                                    all delighted. There was no change in the reality behind the words, and yet the
                                    monkeys responded with joy and anger. Let them, if they want to. So the sage harmonizes
                                    with both right and wrong and rests in Heaven the Equalizer. This is called walking
                                    two roads.

                                    The understanding of the men of ancient times went a long way. How far did it go?
                                    To the point where some of them believed that things have never existed&mdash;so far,
                                    to the end, where nothing can be added. Those at the next stage thought that things
                                    existed but recognized no boundaries among them. Those at the next stage thought
                                    there were boundaries but recognized no right and wrong. Because right and wrong
                                    appeared, the Way was injured, and because the Way was injured, love became complete.
                                    But do such things as completion and injury really exist, or do they not?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is such a thing as completion and injury&mdash;Mr. Chao playing the lute is an
                                    example. There is such a thing as no completion and no injury&mdash;Mr. Chao not playing
                                    the lute is an example. Chao Wen played the lute; Music Master K'uang waved his
                                    baton; Hui Tzu leaned on his desk. The knowledge of these three was close to perfection.
                                    All were masters, and therefore their names have been handed down to later ages.
                                    Only in their likes they were different from him [the true sage]. What they liked,
                                    they tried to make clear. What he is not clear about, they tried to make clear,
                                    and so ended in the foolishness of "hard" and "white." Their sons, too, devoted
                                    all their lives to their fathers' theories, but till their death never reached any
                                    completion. Can these men be said to have obtained completion? If so, then so have
                                    all the rest of us. Or can they not be said to have obtained completion? If so,
                                    then neither we nor anything else have ever attained it.

                                    The torch of chaos and doubt&mdash;this is what the sage steers by. So he does not use
                                    things but relegates all to the constant. This is what it means to use clarity.
                                </p>

                                    Now I am going to make a statement here. I don't know whether it fits into the category
                                    of other people's statements or not. But whether it fits into their category or
                                    whether it doesn't, it obviously fits into some category. So in that respect it
                                    is no different from their statements. However, let me try making my statement.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is a beginning. There is a not yet beginning to be a beginning. There is a
                                    not yet beginning to be a not yet beginning to be a beginning. There is being. There
                                    is nonbeing. There is a not yet beginning to be nonbeing. There is a not yet beginning
                                    to be a not yet beginning to be nonbeing. Suddenly there is being and nonbeing.
                                    But between this being and nonbeing, I don't really know which is being and which
                                    is nonbeing. Now I have just said something. But I don't know whether what I have
                                    said has really said something or whether it hasn't said something.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is nothing in the world bigger than the tip of an autumn hair, and Mount T'ai
                                    is little. No one has lived longer than a dead child, and P'eng-tsu died young.
                                    Heaven and earth were born at the same time I was, and the ten thousand things are
                                    one with me.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We have already become one, so how can I say anything? But I have just said that
                                    we are one, so how can I not be saying something? The one and what I said about
                                    it make two, and two and the original one make three. If we go on this way, then
                                    even the cleverest mathematician can't tell where we'll end, much less an ordinary
                                    man. If by moving from nonbeing to being we get to three, how far will we get if
                                    we move from being to being? Better not to move, but to let things be!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Way has never known boundaries, speech has no constancy. But because of [the
                                    recognition of a] "this," there came to be boundaries. Let me tell you what the
                                    boundaries are. There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates,
                                    there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations, and there
                                    are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues. As to what is beyond the Six
                                    Realms, the sage admits it exists but does not theorize. As to what is withing the
                                    Six Realms, he theorizes but does not debate. In the case of the Spring and Autumn,
                                    the record is the former kings of past ages, the sage debates but does not discriminate.
                                    So [I say,] those who divide fail to divide; those who discriminate fail to discriminate.
                                    What does this mean, you ask? The sage embraces things. Ordinary men discriminate
                                    among them and parade their discriminations before others. So I say, those who discriminate
                                    fail to see.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Great Way is not named; Great Discriminations are not spoken; Great Benevolence
                                    is not benevolent; Great Modesty is not humble; Great Daring does not attack. If
                                    the Way is made clear, it is not the Way. If discriminations are put into words,
                                    they do not suffice. If benevolence has a constant object, it cannot be universal.
                                    If modesty is fastidious, it cannot be trusted. If daring attacks, it cannot be
                                    complete. These five are all round, but they tend toward the square.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Therefore understanding that rests in what it does not understand is the finest.
                                    Who can understand discriminations that are not spoken, the Way that is not a way?
                                    If he can understand this, he may be called the Reservoir of Heaven. Pour into it
                                    and it is never full, dip from it and it never runs dry, and yet it does not know
                                    where the supply comes from. This is called the Shaded Light.

                                    So it is that long ago Yao said to Shun, "I want to attack the rulers of Tsung,
                                    K'uai, and Hsu-ao. Even as I sit on my throne, this thought nags at me. Why is this?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Shun replied, "These three rulers are only little dwellers in the weeds and brush.
                                    Why this nagging desire? Long ago, ten suns came up all at once and the ten thousand
                                    things were all lighted up. And how much greater is virtue than these suns!"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Nieh Ch'ueh asked Wang Ni, "Do you know what all things agree in calling right?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "How would I know that?" said Wang Ni.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Do you know that you don't know it?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "How would I know that?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Then do things know nothing?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "How would I know that? However, suppose I try saying something. What way do I have
                                    of knowing that if I say I know something I don't really know it? Or what way do
                                    I have of knowing that if I say I don't know something I don't really in fact know
                                    it? Now let me ask you some questions. If a man sleeps in a damp place, his back
                                    aches and he ends up half paralyzed, but is this true of a loach? If he lives in
                                    a tree, he is terrified and shakes with fright, but is this true of a monkey? Of
                                    these creatures, then, which one knows the proper place to live? Men eat the flesh
                                    of grass-fed and grain-fed animals, deer eat grass, centipedes find snakes tasty,
                                    and hawks and falcons relish mice. Of these four, which knows how food ought to
                                    taste? Monkeys pair with monkeys, deer go out with deer, and fish play around with

                                    they would dive to the bottom of the stream, if birds saw them they would fly away,
                                    and if deer saw them they would break into a run. Of these four, which knows how
                                    to fix the standard of beauty for the world? The way I see it, the rules of benevolence
                                    and righteousness and the paths of right and wrong are all hopelessly snarled and
                                    jumbled. How could I know anything about such discriminations?"

                                    Nieh Ch'ueh said, "If you don't know what is profitable or harmful, then does the
                                    Perfect Man likewise know nothing of such things?"
                                </p>

                                    Wang Ni replied, "The Perfect Man is godlike. Though the great swamps blaze, they
                                    cannot burn him; though the great rivers freeze, they cannot chill him; though swift
                                    lightning splits the hills and howling gales shake the sea, they cannot frighten
                                    him. A man like this rides the clouds and mist, straddles the sun and moon, and
                                    wanders beyond the four seas. Even life and death have no effect on him, much less
                                    the rules of profit and loss!"
                                </p>

                                    Chu Ch'ueh-tzu said to Chang Wu-tzu, "I have heard Confucius say that the sage does
                                    not work at anything, does not pursue profit, does not dodge harm, does not enjoy
                                    being sought after, does not follow the Way, says nothing yet says something, says
                                    something yet says nothing, and wanders beyond the dust and grime. Confucius himself
                                    regarded these as wild and flippant words, though I believe they describe the working
                                    of the mysterious Way. What do you think of them?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Chang Wu-tzu said, "Even the Yellow Emperor would be confused if he heard such words,
                                    so how could you expect Confucius to understand them? What's more, you're too hasty
                                    in your own appraisal. You see an egg and demand a crowing cock, see a crossbow
                                    pellet and demand a roast dove. I'm going to to try speaking some reckless words
                                    and I want you to listen to them recklessly. How will that be? The sage leans on
                                    the sun and moon, tucks the universe under his arm, merges himself with things,
                                    leaves the confusion and muddle as it is, and looks on slaves as exalted. Ordinary
                                    men strain and struggle, the sage is stupid and blockish. He takes part in ten thousand
                                    ages and achieves simplicity in oneness. For him, all the ten thousand things are
                                    what they are, and thus they enfold each other.

                                    "How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know that in hating

                                    and brought to the state of Chin, she wept until her tears drenched the collar of
                                    her robe. But later, when she went to live in the palace of the ruler, shared his
                                    couch with him, and ate the delicious meats of his table, she wondered why she had
                                    ever wept. How do I know that the dead do not wonder why they ever longed for life?

                                    dream, and in his dream he may even try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes
                                    does he know it was a dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we
                                    know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily
                                    and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, and that one
                                    herdsman&mdash;how dense! Confucius and you are both dreaming! And when I say you are
                                    dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle.
                                    Yet, after ten thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their
                                    meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed.

                                    Suppose you and I have had an argument. If you have beaten me instead of my beating
                                    you, then are you necessarily right and am I necessarily wrong? If I had beaten

                                    wrong? Is one of us right and the other wrong? Are both of us right or are both
                                    of us wrong? If you and I don't know the answer, then other people are bound to
                                    be even more in the dark. Whom shall we get to decide what is right? Shall we get
                                    someone who agrees with you to decide? But if he already agrees with you, how can
                                    he decide fairly? Shall we get someone who agrees with me? But if he already agrees

                                    decide? Obviously, then, neither you nor I nor anyone else can know the answer.
                                    Shall we wait for still another person?

                                    to their endless changes, and so live out your years. What do I mean by harmonizing
                                    them with the Heavenly Equality? Right is not right; so is not so. If right were

                                    Once Chuang Chou dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering
                                    around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Chuang
                                    Chou. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Chuang Chou.
                                    But he didn't know if he was Chuang Chou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a
                                    butterfly dreaming he was Chuang Chou. Between Chuang Chou and a butterfly there
                                    must be some distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things.</p>
