								"Max" [a crystal skull] was given to JoAnn and Carl Parks by a Tibetan red hat lama named <strong class="highlight">Norbu Chen</strong>. I recently spoke with JoAnn about Max and I was impressed with her honesty, humility and integrity. It struck me immediately that she is not out for personal attention or sensationalism. She is a kind woman with a great sense of humor, who had the courage to do what the Universe has asked of her. This is what she told me:
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong class="person">Debbie:</strong> How do you know <strong class="highlight">Norbu Chen</strong>?
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong class="person">JoAnn:</strong> We met <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> through our family medical doctor in 1973. At the time, we really didn't know who he was or what he did. <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> needed some work done on his home, so our doctor recommended my husband who is in the custom furniture manufacturing business. After working on his house for about two months, my husband picked up a magazine and saw <strong class="highlight">Norbu's</strong> picture in it with an article titled <strong class="highlight">Norbu Chen, Tibetan Healer</strong>. <span class="note">[Apparently the Fate Magazine artice.]</span> We were amazed! I then asked my husband to introduce me to <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> because our daughter was dying of bone cancer and the doctors had only given her three months to live. When I met <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> and touched his hand, I knew instinctively that there was something extraordinary about this man. I learned that he had been back in the United States for some time practicing his ancient Tibetan healing methods. I asked all about his work. He told me that be needed someone to answer phones and to tell his patients how to prepare their bodies to the healing energies that would go to the acupuncture points and meridian points of the body. Without really realizing what the next seven years had in store for me, I offered to help him. <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> did work with my daughter and she lived three more years, far longer than the three months we had been told to expect. All I knew was that he was helping people and that's what mattered.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong class="person">Debbie:</strong> I think it was obvious that you were destined to meet.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong class="person">JoAnn:</strong> Well I hadn't even been into metaphysics, didn't work with crystals, and never heard of crystal skulls. It was like walking out of a closet into a whole new world. <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> had an office in the same building as our family doctor. He had to use a lot of strong mind power and breath probe. He completely immerses into our being in the healing rooms. But he had to make a lot of loud noises. This disturbed people in other offices, so <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> built a room onto his home and moved his office there.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was totally unprepared for what I saw the first time I walked in. From floor to ceiling, the room was entirely red. <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> now wore red and black robes rather than conventional clothing, and I wondered what I had gotten myself into. He then showed my husband and I his altar which held several ancient artifacts on it, including a 400 year old musical instrument and the crystal skull which were gifted to him by the Guatemalan shamans in Central America. He never did tell me much about the skull.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> founded the <strong>Chakpori Ling Healing Foundation in Texas</strong>. I witnessed many miracles there and was eventually allowed to go down and watch some of the healing ceremonies. I didn't realize at the time that this was a very, great honor. I never read anything about the crystal skull, but the monks talked to it and chanted to it in Tibetan and claimed they communicated with it. They would tap into the energy of the skull and run it through the meridian of the patients' body to assist their healings. So they used it as their spiritual and healing tool.
							</p>
							<p>
								_____ and and I were very close to <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> and before he died [1977], <strong class="highlight">Norbu</strong> told us nothing about the skull except that it was a rare and special crystal and that only a few of them exist in the world today. He said, &quot;Take this, and one of these days you will know what it is for and about.&quot;
