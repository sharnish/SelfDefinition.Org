1. There is only God, ergo God operated through Adi Da, as Adi Da. As well, as He/She/It operates through, and as, everything and everyone else.

2. Adi Da's doctrines about realization's "stages" might be right or might be wrong. Either the case, still: an unshaken devotional relationship with him worked for some people, as well as the breaking of such one relationship with him is what worked for some other people.

3. Adi Da was maybe realized or maybe he was not, or he was, just to some degree. Yet his ministry was still God's work alone. Like anything else is God's work alone.

4. Bhakti Yoga may result in total "outshining" of the devotee, that is, in nondual realization, where only the Guru remains as everything-and-all, including the being-ness of the devotee's being.

5. Bhakti Yoga's ultimate (or possible) nondual realization may work even when the object of Bhakti is a false guru; since What remains after total abnegation of the false/limited self is the True/Universal Self, the One Self (Which in the [devotional] process was projected on the [false or not] guru's form).

6. Adi Da's apparent (and definite, from a conventional p.o.v.) misbehaviours might have been Leelas of a Divine Avatara, or might have been compulsions of a narcissistic megalomaniac guy. Either the case, still: God operated through them, and was the real owner of Adi Da's form, like He/She/It operates through all apparent events, and owns all forms.

Namaste.

This thread is superb and I enjoyed each and every contribution, from both "sides". Wonderful insights from the nondualistic camp. Incredible demonstrations of surrender from the bhakta camp.

Every One's "hour" of Home hitting is divinely ordered Any Way.

Much Love
