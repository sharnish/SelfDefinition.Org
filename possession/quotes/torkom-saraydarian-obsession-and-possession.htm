        This may be a little too esoteric for some, but maybe not. It is for those who believe we are in a spiritual battle.

As a preacher said decades ago on a tiny radio station in West Virginia: "Everyone is oppressed; many are obsessed; some are possessed."

The last sentence in the article, from a man who spoke from experience: "Another method used by the dark forces is totalitarianism."

                                In esoteric literature, obsession and possession are very clearly defined. Medical
                                literature recognizes only obsession, not possession, because most orthodox scientists
                                have not yet accepted the concept of possession.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What is obsession and how does it occur? Obsession is a phenomenon in which your
                                physical, emotional, and mental bodies are controlled by outside or inside forces
                                other than yourself. When you are obsessed, you do things you are not supposed to
                                do. For example, being obsessed is like abandoning your car on the side of the road
                                and someone jumps in it and drives it away. This 'someone' has different goals and
                                directions than you; he controls your car. Any time a human being loses control
                                over his mind, emotions, body, he is either obsessed or possessed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, if you tell your body to do certain things and the body does not obey,
                                there may be many medical reasons for this, but from the esoteric viewpoint, your
                                nerve centers are controlled by an obsessing entity or by an obsessing thought,
                                event, or image.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A human being's success, beauty, prosperity, and creativity depend on his ability
                                to have full power over his mechanism. Whenever you lose power over your mechanism,
                                you are in danger because someone or something else is controlling you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the physical/etheric level, habits are obsessing forces. They obsess your body
                                and make your body function according to the way the habits want. Let us say that
                                you have a habit of drinking. The moment that you see a bottle of whiskey, you do
                                not have power over yourself. The whiskey controls you and you are obsessed by the
                                whiskey.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anything that you do mechanically eventually becomes your master and obsesses you.
                                Your etheric body is controlled by the directions that the obsession demands from
                                you. You may have an obsession with sex. This obsession can be emotional, mental
                                or etheric. If you see a naked body, you desire it, and the image of the naked body
                                photographically enters your mind, emotions, or etheric centers. At this point you
                                have another guest within your mechanism which tries to control certain parts of
                                your body. This 'guest' is not an entity but a strong impression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second level of obsession is more severe. In the Ageless Wisdom, this level
                                is called glamor. Glamor is a condensation of strong desire. Eventually that desire
                                controls your whole life. When you desire something, you must not lose control over
                                it. Whenever you lose control of a desire, that desire grabs you and drives your
                                car, so to speak. If you have five hundred desires that control you, you have no
                                freedom at all. You may call yourself a free person but you are actually living
                                under myriads of different controllers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Teaching exists to create total independence and freedom. This does not mean
                                freedom to do whatever you want, because as yet you do not exist as an independent
                                Self.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you want do so something, who is the doer? It may be a glamor, habit, thoughtform,
                                posthypnotic suggestion, or an entity that is controlling you. If you are really
                                your awareness unit, you are yourself; then you do things independently with your
                                free will and without being subjected to any outside influences. But if you are
                                'independent' and things in you have control over your pushbuttons, then those things
                                are running your life. The things that are running your life are hidden to such
                                a degree that it is almost impossible to find them or identify them unless you know
                                the techniques to do this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let us consider mental obsession. Fanaticism, for example, is mental obsession.
                                Fanaticism means to think about a particular line of thought, ideology, doctrine,
                                or dogma to such a degree that you are stuck in it. It obsesses you. When you are
                                fanatic, you say, "My religion is the only way to fly." Because you are obsessed
                                by your religion, the obsession does not let you thing otherwise.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mental obsession eventually turns into illusion. An illusion is an image in your
                                mind that says, "I am the only one. Nothing exists besides me." When you reach this
                                stage of crystallization, you are obsessed by your own illusions. For example, an
                                illusion says, "Only my nation; all others are inferior".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Illusions are crystallizations in the mental body. An illusion is composed of distorted
                                mental images that make you believe that it, and nothing lese, is total reality.
                                The corresponding parts of this crystallized portion of the mind in the brain do
                                not function. You think that the whole brain is functioning but it is not. The brain
                                functions at maybe twenty-five percent capacity. If the whole brain is functioning,
                                it is the greatest masterpiece that God gave us. The brain is the most advanced
                                computer that can do anything. It is a television, a radio, a synthesizer, a communicator.
                                But because the mind is blocked with illusions, the corresponding centers in the
                                brain cannot yet function.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Millions of people do not want to think about an object from different viewpoints
                                because their 'windows and doors' are closed. They have only one little opening
                                to the sky through which they hallucinate. Such people are found everywhere.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Health, prosperity, victory and creativity are the results of a mind that is free
                                and open.

                                In the fourteen century, Christians who were supposedly worshipping Christ as the
                                embodiment of Love butchered thousands of people in the name of that Love. They
                                were obsessed by the idea that they were all the chosen ones and that all others
                                were evil. Any thought that isolates itself in your mind without creating associations
                                with other objects, strata, or planes in the Universe becomes an illusion.

                                We must try to annihilate habits. No one must be the slave of any habit because
                                habits use our willpower and prevent our evolution, unfoldment, blooming and right
                                relations. The destruction of habits opens the way for us to develop our life and
                                expand our consciousness.

                                Obsession can occur while watching television. Suppose you are physically ill or
                                emotionally upset when you hear a comment on television that says, "I will kill
                                you!" This enters your mind as a posthypnotic suggestion. Later, is someone disturbs
                                you with even a minor action, you would be prone to say, "I will kill you!" In this
                                case you are hypnotized, and that posthypnotic suggestion is like an entity sitting
                                in your aura. It is a 'control station' within you.

                                People who use drugs or who are involved in sexual abuse are hypnotized and obsessed.
                                The current increase in crimes, accidents, insanity, wasted time, and financial

                                Good habits can be just as harmful as bad habits. No habit is good if it makes you

                                Control over your life is extremely important and necessary. When you lose control
                                through good or bad actions, it is very difficult to regain control. For centuries
                                people have been praying, singing and building churches because of habit. Unfortunately,
                                one can find an abundance of hypocrites in such 'holy' places. Often such people
                                think that someone other than themselves must save them &ndash; and will save them.
                                Through their glamors, they profess that some outer force will help them and others
                                who believe the way that they do. In truth, there is no so-called outer force. The
                                helping force is within each person.

                                A spiritually advanced person acts intelligently. You cannot predict that person's
                                actions because he is free from actions through association. He is not controlled
                                by glamor or illusion. Association is mechanical. Once you have the key, you know
                                what an average person will do next because he is mechanically controlled by association,
                                glamor, and illusion in his nature. Someone once said, "As soon as we begin to enjoy
                                what we are doing and look forward to doing it, we should stop &ndash; even if it
                                is meditation or praying &ndash; because at that point we have lost control."

                                habits, glamors, and illusions. Once you become enslaved, you are lost. But sometimes
                                we enjoy being slaves so that we can swim in the blinding, paralyzing, shallow waters
                                of self-pity.

                                We may ask, "Where is the wisdom of religion, philosophy, and science? What have
                                they taught us?" Actually, whatever they teach, good or bad, is always translated
                                through our habits, glamors, and illusions. It is these translations that affect
                                us, not reality. We can say, "Live in light," but this wisdom can be misinterpreted
                                and used to destroy rather than to serve others.

                                It is said that the whole world is engulfed in maya. Maya in this sense means everything
                                that is in a state of constant change. Maya is sometimes translated as illusion,
                                but this is not the definition of illusion to which we refer. We refer to the psychological
                                illusion that is crystallized in our mental sphere. This crystallization controls
                                the mental mechanism through association or through direct influence.

                                In the Teaching, obsession and possession are two different things. Gradually, science
                                is beginning to recognize possession as well as obsession, and many experiments
                                are being performed to prove scientifically that possession exists. The Teaching,
                                throughout the ages, has taught that possession is a reality. I have seen it in
                                many, many people. It is not a theory; I know that possession exists.
                            </p>

                                Possession occurs when an entity takes control of your mechanism. It occurs in two
                                stages. In the first stage, the entity controls you from the outside by 'remote
                                control'. In the second stage, the entity enters your etheric, emotional, or mental
                                bodies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Insanity and mental disease are considered by most great Teachers to be the result
                                of possession. When your mental body is possessed, a focal point of energy is created
                                that may become a tumor or cancer in the brain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If an entity possesses your emotional body, it creates six conditions that are very
                                dangerous. These conditions are expressed as hatred, fear, anger, greed, jealousy,
                                and revenge.
                            </p>

                                If the etheric body is possessed, the entity creates blind urges and drives for
                                sex, food, alcohol, drugs, and so on.

                                The Possessors
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The first category of possessing entities is discarnate entities of low order awaiting
                                incarnation. These are entities living on the etheric or astral planes who want
                                to contact people in order to enjoy life through them. Let us say that an alcoholic
                                or a sexual pervert dies a sudden death; he enters the etheric or astral planes
                                where he is now missing sex or drug experiences. In order to enjoy them again, he
                                tries to possess a human body and absorb its sensations and experiences. If your
                                behavior suddenly and totally changes, this is a sign that you are under the direct
                                or indirect influence of a possessing entity trying to experience various sensations
                                through you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If an entity wants sexual experiences but cannot get them, he may possess a beautiful
                                girl and make her so hungry for sex that she goes from one man to another. Often
                                such persons are totally ruined by venereal diseases. This occurs in varying degrees,
                                of course. The closer an entity is to you, the more progressively heavy its influence
                                becomes. When you are possessed, you are forced to think only in terms of what the
                                entity wants.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Two psychiatrists and I were once trying to help a woman who was totally possessed
                                by sexual cravings. She left her husband and became a prostitute. Eventually, a
                                specialist in this field was able to free her from the entity. When the entity left,
                                she returned to her normal condition.
                            </p>

                                When you are coming under the control of any blind urge or drive, be careful. It
                                is a sign that you are heading toward danger. You should always be in control. Test
                                yourself in various ways. Let us say that you are going to have sex with your husband
                                or wife. When everything is ready, decide to forego having sex that particular day.
                                In this way you and your partner can demonstrate self-control. You can do the same
                                test with food, drink, drugs, or anything that imposes itself upon you.

                                Suicide victims also possess people. Suppose a teenager commits suicide. He regrets
                                doing it and wants to come in contact with life on earth again. So he tries to possess
                                someone through the sex or solar plexus centers in order to control the other person's
                                life. He can then take control of the person's emotional life, or even make him
                                crave food.

                                People in the Subtle World have many tasks to perform, but if they die with illusions,
                                glamors, and habits, they are inclined to satisfy those urges first, as a demanding
                                force within themselves. This force naturally attracts them to living human beings
                                on earth. Entities see that people on earth are enjoying different pleasures and
                                urges, but being in the subtle planes, they can no longer enjoy these things, so
                                they seek physical contact in the form of possession. This is a means for them to
                                enjoy life as if they had their own physical bodies.
                            </p>

                                A great Teacher advises us that the best way to handle such problems is to be alert
                                to symptoms of the first sign: When you see that you are being controlled by an
                                outside force, stop what you are doing.

                                There are also possessing entities, called earthbound spirits, who are on the verge
                                of incarnating into human kingdom but are not yet human. These entities create animalistic
                                or transcendental urges and drives in people. They cause people to make claims such
                                as, "I am from Venus," or "I am the Christ," and so on.

                                The elements of air, water, earth and fire all have spirits. There are people possessed
                                by such spirits. The differences are interesting. If a water spirit possesses you,
                                it tries to create various urges in you, and you become infatuated with water and
                                everything related to it. Those who are possessed by water spirits live within,
                                on, or near water, and they will die in water. If a fire spirit possesses you, it
                                makes you play with fire in different forms. Those who are possessed by spirit of
                                fire, love fire, work with fire, and will die by fire. Those who are possessed by
                                air spirits like to fly. They like to live in the air, and they will die in the
                                air. Those who are possessed by earth spirits are bound to the earth and will die
                                by earth movements.

                                In normal states of consciousness, people must not be possessed by such entities,
                                which grow on them like parasitic plants grow on trees and suck their energy.

                                As a person advances on the path toward perfection, he becomes more able to protect
                                himself from various kinds of possessive entities. The higher he climbs, the less
                                opportunity is given to these entities, until he eventually finds liberation.

                                Animals may possess those who slaughtered them, who killed them for sport, or who
                                made their lives hell through the torture of vivisection. When animals possess a
                                person, the person expresses uncontrollable sex drives. Most rapists, sadists, and
                                sodomites who cause great pain and suffering to innocent children, teenagers, or
                                mentally retarded individuals, are controlled by animal spirits. There are animals
                                in them, using the human body for revenge on that person.

                                Animals lead human beings into complicated crimes, such as manslaughter. Bestial
                                people are all possessed. Sometimes it is very difficult to control them, as they
                                manifest animal strength and fearless drive.

                                Animals cannot possess the mental body, only the etheric and lower astral bodies.
                                This is why highly-educated people escape possession by them, but after their death,
                                the animals get them.

                                The Universal Law is that no living being must be destroyed without serving a higher
                                purpose. Vivisection is against the Law of Compassion. Killing animals for sport
                                cannot be justified in any way. Of course, questioning regarding this matter can
                                create endless debate, but the law stands firm: "Do unto others what you would have
                                them do unto you".

                                Entities called dark brothers also possess people. For various reasons, these dark
                                brothers try to destroy both individuals and humanity as a whole through various
                                ways. They make a person's entire nature negative, destructive, and poisonous. Primarily,
                                these entities are invoked through channels and mediums, especially mediums.

                                When H. P. Blavatsky was in London, her Teacher sent her to the United States to
                                warn its citizens about the dangers of falling into a condition in which an epidemic
                                of obsession/<wbr>possession, mediums, channels, and hypnotists could exist. Very
                                few people listened to her. Today, mediums are increasing like mushrooms, and people
                                everywhere are listening to them.
                            </p>

                                Remember this principle: Your destiny is to be free. You are not to be under the
                                influence of anything. You must develop your own reason, logic, and intuition. You
                                must do only those things that you want to do, free of imposition. You must know
                                what you want to know, without being enslaved by entities.

                                No medium, channel or hypnotist must be allowed to use you. You must use your own
                                mind, intellect, and intuition. You can have direct contact with your Teacher, just
                                as Blavatsky, Alice Bailey, and Helena Roerich did. Helena Roerich wrote fourteen
                                books; she was not a medium or a channel but was in direct contact with her Teacher.
                                As the Teacher talked, she would write down what He said. At all times she had conscious
                                control and communication. Such people are mediators, not mediums or channels.

                                Possession is more serious than obsession. An obsessed or possessed person shows
                                the following signs:
                            </p>

                                <li>The expression of gossip, slander, and malice. </li>
                                <li>Unrestrained hatred. </li>
                                <li>Excessive talking. </li>

                            <p>
                                When you hang onto someone, in some degree you are obsessing or possessing that
                                person.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Obsession is more common than possession. Possessing entities are very intelligent.
                                They are interested in contacting and using people who are in positions of power
                                and influence. These entities know precisely what they are doing. They use the most
                                sophisticated equipment and methods to accomplish their dark goals and purpose.
                                Entities search for physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually advanced people
                                to possess. We can even say that more advanced people are possessed than average
                                people. Remember, too, that entities also possess groups or entire nations.
                            </p>

                                When a person lies, he is either obsessed or possessed, depending on the degree.
                                If you lie five times a day, you are obsessed. If you lie fifty times a day, you
                                are cheating yourself to a large degree and do not know the unreal from real; you
                                are possessed. Sometimes you even believe your own lies and can no longer distinguish
                                between truth and fiction. In this condition, you are in great danger of possession,
                                if you are not already possessed.

                                Epilepsy is the result of an attack by various entities. They attack the consciousness
                                thread and try to snap it. If an entity succeeds in snapping the consciousness thread,
                                the person becomes unconscious until the life thread recharges the consciousness
                                thread and re-establishes the current of light going to the brain. If those with
                                epilepsy do not follow a spiritual discipline and high moral codes, entities can
                                eventually possess them.

                                Possession and obsession can occur intermittently. In other words, an entity can
                                enter, then leave, and then return again. Persistent, heavy, focused labor keeps
                                them away. Entities leave especially if a person is in the presence of a great Teacher.
                                His psychic energy, love and enthusiasm repel such entities.

                                Possession occurs especially during critical times. At a personal level, if you
                                have an accident and are unconscious for several hours, it is possible for an entity
                                to enter. If this occurs, as you are returning to consciousness from the subjective
                                side, you see that your body is occupied by a strange entity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let us say that an entity is occupying the body of an elderly person who is about
                                to die. That entity begins searching for another body to occupy. If a young child
                                has an accident and leaves his body for a time, the entity immediately vacates the
                                ninety-year-old body and enters the child's body, where it regenerates the boy and
                                continues living for another ninety years or so. There are entities like this that
                                live many long lives using this method of changing from one 'car' to another. The
                                accident victim whose body is taken over by the entity is 'thrown out' so to speak,
                                onto the astral or mental planes. The victim, in turn, will probably try to possess
                                others to gain contact with the physical world.

                                In the case of a suicide, it may be that the person committing suicide is already
                                possessed and the possessing entity wants the person back in the Subtle Planes.
                                So it plants a posthypnotic suggestion to commit suicide in the person's mind.

                                Be very cautious with your actions. Avoid creating situations and events where people
                                can think about you negatively because their thoughts will come to you. You may
                                feel the impact of negative thoughts immediately. If this happens, it is helpful
                                to think of yourself as being beautiful and to say,

                                People often ask if it is possible for a baby to be born obsessed or possessed.
                                If we have not advanced to the higher mind and our mental body was obsessed or possessed
                                in the past, we can bring the obsession and possession with us into our new incarnation.
                                If a person is in the astral plane with lots of bad karma, astral entities can obsess
                                him; he may be born with these entities also. Some young children may show signs
                                of obsession or possession. This is why it is very important to purify ourselves
                                before we pass away.

                                You can be obsessed or possessed in your physical body. Separation between the etheric
                                and dense physical body provided opportunities for entities to enter your physical
                                body. Venereal diseases and habits such as drugs, alcohol, inertia, and an inactive
                                life can create those conditions in which entities may enter your body. Stagnated
                                bodies invite unwholesome guests.

                                    Jealousy creates obsession primarily in the mental plane. Initially you are obsessed
                                    by the person of whom you are jealous. His or her image gradually finds a way to
                                    enter your subconscious mind, and when it starts controlling you, it becomes and
                                    obsession. </li>
                                <li>Sex can obsess you. You can receive another person's obsession or possession the
                                    first time you have sexual intercourse with him. We know that through wrong sexual
                                    relations a person can be obsessed or possessed. Since ancient times, prostitution
                                    has been forbidden. Be extremely careful with whom you have sexual relations.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Religions and the Ageless Wisdom have always spoken against these evils. Remember
                                that obsession always paves the way for those who want to possess you. Obsession
                                dulls your observations and deadens your analytical mind, and then suddenly the
                                obsessing/<wbr>possessing entity enters your body. One way to identify obsession
                                in a person is to observe his eyes. The eyes of an obsessed or possessed person
                                have no focus. He looks at you, but he does not actually see you. Something is obstructing
                                his eyes from registering what he sees. Sometimes the eyes are even crossed, their
                                focus is lost, or the look glassy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the majority of cases involving physical possession, entry is gained through
                                the sacral center. Emotional obsession is usually effected through the lower solar
                                plexus; obsessing mental entities enter through the throat center.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Possessed ones live as if in a dream. They do not comprehend what they say because
                                the possessing entity controls them and speaks through them. When a person is possessed,
                                he is actually absent. In the case of possession, the soul, the awareness unit,
                                is cast out of the body. Possessed persons may think they are speaking with someone
                                but in essence they are in a dream.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Possessed people are mechanical and automatic. This explains their frequent change
                                of moods and thought. They are not sincere and they do not know what it is they
                                are saying. The often become fiercely agitated and say such things as, "I hate you,"
                                and then the next moment they say, "I love you." They are not there. The entities
                                are playing a drama through them. One can learn many things about obsession and
                                possession by knowing how to observe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We may wonder how the possessing entity benefits. His sole benefit is to enjoy himself
                                at the cost of others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                People also occasionally ask if an advanced soul can possess or obsess a person.
                                High-level entities do not obsess so-called average people. They do sometimes approach
                                advanced persons, not for exploitation, but to save the life of another person or
                                to perform some heroic deed. When the specific mission is finished, the high-level
                                entity leaves the person.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes artists, leaders, writers, composers, and so on can be 'obsessed' for
                                a short time. In such cases, the purpose of the 'obsession' is to produce something
                                very important to help the world. But again, one must always aspire toward independence
                                in order to develop his own potentials.
                            </p>

                                Lower obsession is epidemic. When Christ was removing the entities from an insane
                                person, He said, "Their name is legion." "Legion" means large in number; they are
                                entities like monkeys, holding onto one another's tail. If you are obsessed with
                                one entity, it is likely that others will move in to join the first one. This is
                                the beginning of insanity. Insanity is a condition where you have no control over
                                your body or mind, a condition in which entities take control of all the centers
                                in your body.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If someone you are with is possessed, you may also be contaminated by the possessing
                                entity and even bring it in your own system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Obsession is a common sickness in people who work in situations where blood is shed,
                                such as battlefield or slaughterhouses. If these people are sensitive or have cracked
                                auras, they present themselves as possible candidates for possession. Great Ones
                                warn us about bloodshed. An epidemic of obsession occurs following bloodshed, but
                                if a person's aura is pure and he has psychic energy, he can resist possession for
                                long time in such locations.

                                The Ageless Wisdom teaches that entities are attracted to your home or to your body
                                when it is contaminated with dirt or blood. Blood is especially forbidden because
                                dark entities are attracted to the smell of blood.

                                In the future, scientists will be able to demonstrate that many microbes are the
                                bodies of entities that prefer to nourish themselves on blood. Women must exercise
                                special care during their menstrual periods to maintain extreme cleanliness and
                                to focus their minds on great art, beautiful music, and higher thoughts. This elevates
                                and strengthens a woman's vibration so that dark entities are repelled by her radiation.

                                The aura is a kind of electricity that radiates from your three bodies and higher
                                vehicles. Like a shield it protects you. When this shield is strong, your immunity
                                is also strong. The disease of AIDS increases primarily due to wrong sexual relations
                                and drug abuse. People destroy their auras with these actions and, subsequently,
                                their immunity is wiped out. Without immunity, any microbe can enter and crush you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The greatest immunity available is psychic energy. Psychic energy is a ruby-violet
                                colored energy that fuses the whole aura. When you see people with psychic energy,
                                their auras vibrate with ruby and violent colors. They repel all microbes.
                            </p>

                                Immunity is related to the lymphatic system. Be careful when using public restrooms,
                                public drinking fountains, and so on. Science has now documented that AIDS is transferred
                                through contact with contaminated blood or semen. Ask your doctor how to protect
                                yourself, but by increasing your psychic energy and discipline, you will never contract
                                this kind of disease.

                                Viruses have emotional and mental bodies. Physical contamination is followed several
                                years later with contamination in the emotional body, then a while later in the
                                mental body. Germs and viruses are exactly like human beings; they have etheric,
                                astral, and mental bodies. This concept makes great sense; viruses are very sensitive.
                                Sensitivity characterizes the astral body, and intelligence the mental body.

                                Viruses, like cells, are entities living in a larger entity. It is interesting that
                                viruses are seen as sparkling colors, rather than forms. Two hundred years from
                                now, discoveries will reveal that tuberculosis is actually the name of an entity.
                                The microbes and germs we detect today are the cells of a possessing entity.

                                Infectious diseases such as measles, influenza, colds, and so on are entities that
                                contaminate large number of people at one time. A week or two later they move on
                                to another city. These entities infect us through our moral sickness, hatred, wrong
                                human relations, greed, cheating, too much sex, drugs, and so on. If you are weakened,
                                they are attracted to you. For example, while travelling in the desert one day,
                                I noticed flocks of crows accumulating on the highway. They were preying on large
                                numbers of snakes that had been killed by cars. Wherever there is contamination,
                                these kinds of birds flock. Likewise, if there is contamination in our spiritual
                                morality, entities are attracted to us.

                                We sometimes think of primitive cultures as being very backward. When I was in Africa,
                                I observed native healers who were chasing a sickness out of a person. They said,
                                "We want to scare the sickness, the entity. When it finally leaves, the man will
                                be healed." Science has traditionally rejected these methods, but there has been
                                a recent renewed interest in these practices, as well as research into the value
                                of various herbs and roots as healing agents. A plant is the body of an entity that,
                                through the plant, can heal you.

                                Human beings came to this earth as students going through the school of Life. Your
                                destination is to graduate with honors. You must strive for the best body, the best
                                emotions, heart, and mind, and to cultivate all of your divine potentials and powers.
                                Eventually you will graduate from this earth and enter higher spheres to continue
                                your progress toward galaxies and the Cosmos. This is your destination. If you walk
                                in harmony toward your destination, you will benefit from all the forces and energies
                                in the Universe. If you work against your destination by degenerating yourself,
                                you will draw every kind of destructive entity and event to yourself until you are
                                annihilated. The Great Sage says, "The greatest protection is striving toward the
                                heights." You must strive towards the spiritual heights &ndash; heights of Beauty,
                                Goodness, Righteousness, Joy, and Freedom.

                                If you strive with the five-pointed star, nothing can conquer you. Starting with
                                the highest point of the star and continuing clockwise, we have Beauty, then Goodness,
                                Righteousness, Joy, and Freedom.

                                The five-pointed star will protect you. Always try to think, speak, and act according
                                to the values of the five-pointed star. When your physical, emotional, and mental
                                actions are in conflict with the star, you are in danger of attack.

                                Do not act in ugliness. If you are doing anything ugly, you will be prey for the
                                vultures and wolves. Through ugliness, you attract them to your body.

                                Beauty is the first sword to use against possessing entities. Be physically beautiful
                                in dress, actions, speech, and so on. Be emotionally and mentally beautiful. Your
                                Inner Self will tell you when you are expressing beauty on all these levels, and
                                if you do anything ugly, It will also warn you by saying, "Don't do that!"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You will never create bad karma if you are totally filled with Goodness. When you
                                express goodness in your actions, you will never feel regretful. But you will regret
                                a million times when you do wrong.

                                Righteousness is the highest virtue that controls your karmic destination. Do not
                                be unrighteous with even one penny. We are told that when Mohammed was dying, something
                                was deeply troubling him. He called a friend and told him to repay a chicken that
                                he had taken several weeks earlier from a neighbor. He did not want he karma of
                                the unpaid debt to go with him to the other side. On the other side, you pay an
                                additional ninety-nine percent tax on unpaid debts.

                                Do not forget the angels who appeared to Lot and said, "We are going to burn Sodom
                                and Gomorrah." But Lot begged them not to burn the cities if ten righteous people
                                can be found." "Let me find them, then," Lot responded. He searched, but he could
                                not even find five righteous men, so the cities were burned. The same fate can befall
                                humanity again. If we increase righteousness, we will be saved. If we continue in
                                our unrighteousness, the fire will clean us.

                                If you undergo surgery, do not feel sorry for yourself. Have somebody nearby to
                                create joy in you. Three days later you will be healed. Joy is psychic energy &ndash;
                                your own essence &ndash; that pours down into your aura and builds a shield around
                                you. The Great Sage says, "Nobody can conquer a man who has Joy in his heart."

                                If you are depressed or angry, start smiling and soon your depression will disappear.
                                Force yourself to smile. Of course, a smile is only one percent of total joy, but
                                if you start smiling, the rest slowly comes. Even if you are talking with someone
                                whom you dislike, approach him with a smile and negativity will disappear.

                                Freedom is a state of consciousness that cannot be easily achieved. Real freedom
                                is the absence of obsession and possession. It is a state of being your True Self.
                                If anything is influencing you, you are not free. If you have spiritual indifference
                                and control over the things that might influence you, then you are free.

                                One of the best ways to control obsession and possession is the use of violet light.
                                Dark entities hate violet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sunshine also repels dark entities, but one must sit in the sun only for five minutes.
                                Following your brief exposure, take a shower.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Good sleep revitalizes the body and stops possession. To prepare for sleep, do not
                                eat or drink after sunset or after five o'clock, whichever comes first. Take a nice
                                bath or cold shower. Everything must be cleaned from your body so that you can relax.
                                If possible, sleep in a room that contains only your bed. Have no music or perfumes
                                where you sleep. Windows must be darkened and opened slightly for fresh air to enter.
                                A darkened room is preferable because light stimulates certain centers in your brain,
                                causing many kinds of unwanted dreams that are fabrications of your psyche.

                                The next method to help prevent possession and obsession is swimming, dancing, physical
                                labor, and climbing mountains. Do not sit home like potatoes. Mountain climbing
                                is very good for the nervous and glandular systems, more particularly the glandular
                                system. You must sweat and strive, then return home for a nice bath and rest. Climbing
                                is especially good for people living in polluted cities. Dancing is also very beneficial,
                                especially folk dancing.

                                Meditation is the supreme shield against possession and obsession. But you must
                                do correct meditation.

                                Love and beauty are very important protections. Think about beauty, about light,
                                about love. Imagine and visualize that you are actually fused with light, love,
                                and beauty.

                                Your aura is weakened and your protection becomes faulty through any expression
                                of lying, stealing, gossip, slander, and malice. Every time you deceive someone,
                                including yourself, you crack your aura.

                                Some people wonder about chanting. If chanting is done mechanically, it is extremely
                                dangerous because it leads you into posthypnotic state of consciousness. If you
                                know what you are chanting and what the chanting means and are always conscious
                                while doing it, then there is no danger. If you are frequently chanting in a conscious
                                way, you must be certain that you can contain that energy which comes into your
                                centers. Sometimes your most active centers absorb the energy and then go out of
                                control.

                                Let us say that your most active center is your sex center and you are chanting.
                                Because your charkas are not harmonized, integrated and balanced with each other,
                                the energy created by chanting will immediately go to your sex center. As you increase
                                the chanting, you become more excited and sex oriented. The more energy you receive,
                                the more your energy must be used in a field of worthy labor. Chanting is less dangerous
                                if it is done by a group.

                                Prayer is very good before you sleep. Calling the names of your Teachers is also
                                excellent. You can call out to God, Christ, Buddha, Whomever you want. Your stomach
                                must be clean, no intoxication. Your daily life must be righteous, pure, and clean
                                so that your conscience does not bother you.

                                Abortion is a crime against an incarnating soul. This soul will be thrown into the
                                etheric plane, where he will suffer for as long as he was intended to live on the
                                physical plane if he had not been aborted. Often those who commit abortion are acting
                                under the force of possession. It is also observed that the incarnating ego is possessed,
                                and this possession influences the mother to have an abortion so as not to give
                                the incarnating one a chance to free himself from his possessor.

                                Alcohol damages the solar plexus, both in the etheric body and on the fourth mental
                                level where the mental correspondent of the solar plexus exists. This center in
                                the mental plane is used to create causes or those thoughts that will put forces
                                or energies into action. Alcohol paralyzes such a process. Instead, it opens the
                                path of the possessing entity to use the man to express his destructive intentions.

                                Alcoholics will come back mentally retarded in their next life. But if they quit

                                the tragic consequences waiting for them in the next life. If they do not overcome
                                their drinking and die as alcoholics, they will be born without direction, initiative,
                                and striving, and thus will work for others as slaves.

                                The quantity of alcohol consumed is not the decisive factor in determining the effects
                                of alcohol. Sometimes one cup of wine will destroy the brain; sometimes a person
                                will have to drink for ten years before he destroy his brain. The damage accumulates
                                and hits the person at a time that is unexpected.

                                The best policy is not to use alcohol at all, not even to please other people. Alcoholic
                                egos attach themselves to those who use the same vice, and they often travel with
                                each other, possessing each other alternately.

                                Smoking tobacco or marijuana dulls the pineal gland and the sensitive cells around
                                it that transmit communications from the Solar Angel. It is a very slow process,
                                but eventually the damage reaches large proportions. Chewing tobacco kills the haemoglobin
                                of the blood and opens the person to invite in unwanted entities.

                                control over the masses. Their methods of control include

                                A microbe, germ, or virus is an energy wave. If the darkened souls discover the
                                frequency of certain microbes, germs, and viruses, they could easily create mass
                                epidemics. It is also possible to find those frequencies that could destroy such
                                evil frequencies. The use of frequency will become one of the weapons of enemy nations
                                if world peace is not achieved. The war will be waged in space, and all creatures
                                will be affected. We are told that the Atlantean civilization reached such a stage
                                of knowledge and that from that moment on their destiny of annihilation was determined
                                by their own karma. At present, such research is being undertaken everywhere with
                                intense effort.</p>
                            <p>
                                In 1973, one day by chance I discovered a barn that housed a huge electrical machine
                                that contained many pocket-like holes. The operator told me that the machine could
                                kill a person or destroy a nation if they could discover the frequency of that person
                                or nation or of certain people in that nation. The operator inadvertently showed
                                me a list of names programmed into the machine, and to my shocked surprise, my name
                                was written on that paper contained in one of the pockets of the machine, dated
                                1969. It was interesting that my health had been deteriorating steadily since 1969,
                                and in 1973 I was in bad shape. The operator had shown me the names without knowing
                                who I was. My name had been given to them by a woman who disliked me because her
                                daughter was a member of our organization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I saw my name, I said with perfect calmness and a smile, "I know this man and
                                he is already dead. Why do you still have his name on your list? Perhaps you want
                                to punish his soul?" He removed my name from the list and deleted it from the machine.
                                From that day forward, I felt a great release and my health improved considerably.
                                Later, when I tried to relocate the barn, I could not. It was two hours toward the
                                mountains from Denver, on a secluded farm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meditation and deep thinking can end confusion by creating peace between conflicting
                                thoughts, making them cooperate with each other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The human being must progress at a speed that is ahead of periodic crises. If our
                                spiritual progress is controlled by such a speed that we bypass these dates, the
                                pollution will not affect us. For example, before the year 1945 if my consciousness
                                advances to the level of 1950, or if before 1985 my consciousness is already in
                                2000, this means that because of my speed of progress, I will not clash with any
                                of these situations or be involved with them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Spiritual progress is not only enlightenment and achievement for the human soul,
                                but it is also health, happiness, and prosperity of the personality and its life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I once saw a yogi drink poison. He immediately began to perspire and emanate a bad
                                odor. Then he jumped into a very cold river, washed himself off, and said, "That
                                is all." Later I discovered that one-tenth of the dosage he took could kill a person
                                in just a few minutes. The secret was that his higher centers were active, and they
                                used the poison as a cleaning agent, changing the poison into a kind of nourishment
                                for the body. This is how we are able to cope with or bypass dangerous situations
                                if we are ahead in our evolution. As the human body and mind cyclically discharges
                                certain accumulations, so does Nature. A person can escape Nature's cycles of elimination
                                if he speeds his evolution or if he faces his emotional, physical, moral, and psychic
                                pollution, having immunity, and renders a great service during the crisis.

                                Subliminal messages cause certain side-effects when impressing your brain. If you
                                are sensitive you may experience

                                Most popular music is loaded with subliminal suggestions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Subliminal messages used to obsess or possess people are also used in advertisements
                                in the paper, on the radio, television, films, and so on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Obsession is spread by drugs; the use of drugs opens the gates for possession. Drugs
                                create a rent between our bodies. Excessive fire from higher bodies descends to
                                the lower bodies and centers, creating imbalance, congestion, or over-stimulation
                                in the lower centers. For an obsessor this is a golden opportunity to exercise control.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is also possible that because of the rents, other entities can enter our vehicles,
                                or they find easy access going from one vehicle into another. They eventually succeed
                                in possessing the whole mechanism of the person.
                            </p>

                                Obsession is spread through greed and fear. To justify our greed, we fabricate many
                                kinds of needs. We even succeed in deceiving ourselves, thinking that what we really
                                need is what others have. When greed obsesses people, they turn into grasshoppers
                                who eat and waste all our natural resources, increase pollution, poison, and eventually
                                kill Mother Earth, and with Her, themselves as well.

                                Obsession and possession are injected into our society by mediums. This is a very
                                serious matter. In every city, hundreds of mediums, psychics and channels are at
                                work allowing 'disembodied liars' to control the life of our society, sometimes
                                even the actions of our leaders. Mediums know what to say, how to say it, and to
                                whom to speak so that they pollute the minds of people more efficiently, make them
                                dependent slaves on their advice and philosophies, and eventually, after gaining
                                their confidence, lead the to destruction.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mediums, channels, and lower psychics do not realize that they are being used and
                                manipulated –and what a sad destiny awaits them in the future. When mediums, psychics
                                and channels increase, it is a sign that society will fall into the path of corruption
                                and degeneration.
