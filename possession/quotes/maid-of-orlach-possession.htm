                                The most remarkable possession case from the files of the German mesmerist Justinus
                                Kerner. <sup>[1]</sup> The Maid of Orlach was a dairymaid over whom a White Spirit
                                and a Black Spirit fought for control. The spirits were those of a sinning nun and
                                a murderous monk. In the end, a house had to be destroyed to get rid of the possessing
                                demon. The account of the maid is in Kerner’s 1834 book Geschichten Besessener neuerer
                                Zeit (Histories of Modern Possession). <sup>[2]</sup>

                                Strange events began in February 1831 at the farm home of a Lutheran peasant named
                                Grombach, who lived in the tiny village of Orlach, Wurtemberg, Germany. The activity
                                centered in the cowhouse and involved his daughter, Magdalene, the &quot;maid.&quot;
                                First, the cows were affected and poltergeist phenomena occurred. The cows would
                                be mysteriously tied to new spots, and their tails were braided. Grombach kept watch
                                but caught no visible person in the act. Magdalene one day received a sharp blow
                                to one of her ears that sent her cap flying. From February 8 through February 11,
                                mysterious fires broke out in the cow house. Then, Magdalene heard a child whimpering
                                in the cottage house, but none could be seen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A shadowy gray apparition of a woman appeared to Magdalene against a wall in the
                                cow house. The spirit, which became known as the White Spirit, said the fires had
                                been caused by an evil spirit, but that she had protected the family. She said that
                                400 years earlier, she had been a 14-year-old girl who was sent against her will
                                to a convent, where she had committed a sin she could not reveal. She told Magdalene
                                that the house must be destroyed by March 5 the following year. It told her, &quot;Flee
                                from the house! Flee from the house! If it is not pulled down before the fifth of
                                March of the coming year a misfortune will happen to you ... promise me that you
                                will do it!&quot; The girl agreed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The White Spirit appeared frequently to the maid until May. It also spoke in religious
                                language and prayed the 112th Psalm. It read Magdalene’s thoughts and accurately
                                predicted future events. No one but she could see it. In May, the White Spirit announced
                                that she would not be able to visit for some time, and Magdalene would be persecuted
                                by the Black Spirit, her evil companion. Magdalene should never answer him, no matter
                                what happened.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Black Spirit took various guises, such as frogs, a black cat, dogs, a headless
                                horse, and disembodied male voices that followed the maid, mocking her. Then, it
                                began showing up as a monk, tempting her with questions. The Black Spirit sometimes
                                imitated the voices of neighbors in order to trick the girl into answering, but
                                she held fast in her silence to him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A bag of coins mysteriously appeared in the barn, and the Black Spirit said he put
                                it there to compensate the maid for the box on the ear. Soon, the White Spirit appeared
                                and told the maid that the money must be given to the poor. It was.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After this, the Black Spirit intensified his attacks on Magdalene. He appeared as
                                a bear on July 15 and threatened to plague her if she would not answer him. From
                                then on, he appeared in various monstrous, animalistic shapes, promising her money
                                and threatening her with torture.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On August 21, the Black Spirit appeared as a horrible animal with its neck in the
                                middle of its body. The maid fainted and was unconscious for several hours. The
                                fainting episodes happened again on the following days. She could answer questions
                                while entranced but could not remember anything when she awakened. She said that
                                the Black Spirit came upon her and then disappeared when the White Spirit arrived.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On August 23, the White Spirit said she would protect Magdalene from harm but urged
                                her to proceed with demolishing the family’s house, to end her suffering. The spirit
                                said that the Black Spirit would take complete possession of her, but that she,
                                the White Spirit, would take Magdalene away to a place of safety when that happened.
                                These developments finally prompted Magdalene’s father to begin tearing down the
                                house.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beginning on August 25, Magdalene fell under intensified attacks from the Black
                                Spirit, who was able to take over her body and speak through her mouth. A description
                                of the manner of possession is as follows: In the midst of her work she would see
                                the figure of a man clothed in a monk’s frock, which seemed to be made from black
                                mist, approach and say, when she refused to answer his questions: &quot;Now I will
                                enter thy body in spite of thee.&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then she always felt him tread on her left side, seize her with five cold fingers
                                at the back of the neck and then enter her body. She lost consciousness and individuality.
                                Her voice was no longer her own, but that of the monk’s. The speeches which she
                                uttered when in this state were worthy of a demon. Magdalene lay during the whole
                                time with her head sunk towards her left side, and her eyes firmly closed; if the
                                eyelids were raised the pupils would be discovered upwards. The left foot constantly
                                moved up and down upon the ground throughout the attack, which frequently lasted
                                four or five hours.
                            </p>

                                to side while the Black Spirit was in her and then flop to the right when it left.
                                If a Bible was placed nearby, the Black Spirit hissed like a SERPENT and tried to
                                spit on it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Magdalene remembered nothing from the attacks, except a faint memory of having attended
                                church, presumably the way she perceived the protection of the White Spirit. Her
                                left foot always went cold during the attacks, while her right foot stayed warm.
                                But upon awakening, she could walk normally and felt nothing wrong with either foot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Magdalene was taken to doctors, who said she had a natural illness and prescribed
                                pills or medications, but none helped her. Finally Grombach took her to see Kerner.
                                He tried magnetic passes two or three times, but the Black Spirit immediately neutralized
                                them with countermovements of the girl’s hands. Kerner recommended prayer and a
                                sparse diet. Magdalene did not respond to those, either, but Kerner was confident
                                the matter would resolve itself according to the White Spirit’s promise of a cure
                                by March 5.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Word spread about the girl’s afflictions, and crowds would gather to watch her when
                                she was possessed. On March 4, the day before the White Spirit’s deadline, the White
                                Spirit appeared to the maid at six in the morning. She confessed her sins: She had
                                been seduced by the monk who was now the Black Spirit and had lived with him. When
                                she tried to reveal his wickedness, he had murdered her. While the spirit spoke,
                                a phantom black dog appeared and spit fire. The White Spirit reached her hand toward
                                the maid, who touched it with a handkerchief. The cloth sparkled and then exhibited
                                holes that matched a palm print.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The White Spirit said she was now freed from earthly concerns and said farewell.
                                The maid was taken to a neighbor’s house, where the Black Spirit took possession,
                                during which the girl ate no food. A huge crowd gathered to witness this and to
                                question the demon, which gave accurate answers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Deliverance occurred when the Black Spirit prayed during the night of March 4 and
                                for the first time could say the words Jesus, Bible, church, and heaven. He confessed
                                all of his crimes, including murders. He said there is a reckoning after death,
                                and he must appear at the judgment seat a second time after he departed the maid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The last wall of the Gromlach cottage was destroyed at 11:30 on the morning of March
                                5. The Black Spirit left Magdalene in an astounding transformation back to radiant
                                health. She was never troubled again. Old bones were found in the debris of the
                                house, including those of children, who people assumed were the victims of the monk.
