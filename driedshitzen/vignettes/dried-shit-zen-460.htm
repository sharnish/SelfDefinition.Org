                                <li>Everything you "believe" and were "taught" is probably wrong.
                                    Why not try some direct perception?</li>
                                <li>When @mujaku speaks of the unborn luminosity
                                    of mind, he's "right" -- but if I didn't experience this "myself",
                                    I wouldn't believe him. </li>
                                <li>What's the point of Non-Duality if you're going to divide up people "realized
                                    beings" and those who are still "on the path"? </li>
                                <li>I like to read this man's brief and potent essays: http://www.<wbr>thespiritworks.com/
                                </li>
                                <li>"Dr. Gregory Tucker" intrigues me in some ways even more than "Wei
                                    Wu Wei." http://www.<wbr>thespiritworks.com/ </li>
                                <li>@praybob Actually I don't know the meaning of it at all. Because, obviously, it's
                                    both pretentious and ridiculous. </li>
                                <li>@praybob. Which is why I usually just go with "Dried shit." </li>
                                <li>Still, "luminous" is a figurative adjective based on vision. How could
                                    the original mind be luminous if it's what's before there are eyes?</li>
                                <li>"There
                                    are many kinds of eyes. Even the Sphinx has eyes. There are many truths -- therefore
                                    there is no Truth." -Zen Master Nietzsche. </li>
                                <li>Though Zen people often speak of Mind, there is really no Mind to speak of.</li>
                                <li>You have hands, feet, eyes, nose, ears -- all, presumably, like other people. Your
                                    eyebrows are above your eyes, your nose above your mouth </li>
                                <li>Wanting Truth on top of all that is sheer presumption! You should be doused with
                                    cold water like a misbehaving rooster. </li>
                                <li>For "Follow Friday," I have to confess to a special fondness for @garabdorje.
                                    Starting with his handle. </li>
                                <li>I also like @lux1008 -- sort of crush on her -- but I wish she'd stay off the politics.
                                    (Yawn!) </li>
                                <li>Feeling that if I ever met @Ogmin in person he'd "box my ears" for talking
                                    such shit. Or maybe just give me the silent Dharma treatment. </li>
                                <li>Here's an interesting "walking" Dharma gate: while walking, just note
                                    how your field of vision bounces up and down and from side to side. </li>
                                <li>That's interesting, isn't it? Why? Because usually your mind edits this subtle bouncing
                                    motion out. </li>
                                <li>In fact, the closer you get to the "Now" and the "Here" -- the
                                    more you realize the world looks nothing like you thought it did. </li>
                                <li>Replacing your usual cliched ideas about the world with Buddhist cliches is pretty
                                    pointless. </li>
                                <li>The so-called Dharma was devised to awaken, not comfort you. </li>
                                <li>Follow @Taoteaking for the monkeymind monkeying. </li>
                                <li>Follow @ryderjaphy for some crusty and occasionally cranky Buddhism. </li>
                                <li>Duality is maintained, in essence, to reinforce the myth that one is a distinguished
                                    and special person. </li>
                                <li>Getting rid of philosophical Duality is easy, but getting rid of the myth that one
                                    is distinguished and special for one's "insight" -- hard. </li>
                                <li>"Duality" and "me" are evil twins, </li>
                                <li>but they're nothing without each other. "Mini-Me, you complete me."</li>
                                <li>People starting to practice Buddhism often fear it's death for the ego. Be comforted:
                                    as a Buddhist, ego will flourish as never before. </li>
                                <li>It's because he had what is now sometimes called a "strong ego" that Guatama
                                    was able to reach Mind-Realization. </li>
                                <li>@lux1008 Really? Because "I" *can't* get no satisfaction. </li>
                                <li>Follow @BarkingUnicorn for fun. </li>
                                <li>Follow @ArielBravy for love. </li>
                                <li>Follow @ZenDirtZenDust to see him dust it up with @mujaku. </li>
                                <li>Follow @dragonheartsong because she's sweet. </li>
                                <li>@lux1008 If no+no = yes, does no+no+no = maybe? Maybe it would be "I"
                                    cannot not get no satisfaction? </li>
                                <li>"The Dude abides" -- but Mind abides nowhere. </li>
                                <li>Mind is homeless. </li>
                                <li>Hey buddy can you spare a quarter? I've got get on a bus to visit my sick grandmother
                                    in Amarillo. </li>
                                <li>Buddha once claimed that to be a good Dharma practicer you need to have all the
                                    qualities of a boy who takes care of an elephant. </li>
                                <li>It's a good week for me when I'm only accused of "clinging to apparent words,"
                                    being "unripe," "wandering like a blind ghost" -- </li>
                                <li>"barking like a mad dog," and merely having had "a short experience
                                    of emptiness" that I "could not comprehend." </li>
                                <li>Even though, not a week before, I was a "real practitioner." So "namaste"
                                    to you, too, my good Dharma friend @garabdorje! </li>
                                <li>And here's a three bark-salute (one yip for each of the Three Jewels) for you from
                                    the "blind ghost of a mad dog." Wu! Wu! Wu! </li>
                                <li>A page with some fine religious reading material on it. I'd like to get some of
                                    these etched on stone. "Zen Assholes": http://bit.ly/F6Wu3 </li>
                                <li>What is Buddha? . . . "Dry shit on a stick." I don't understand these
                                    words. The infant is sucking on his toes. -Master Seung Sahn </li>
                                <li>Here is a tweet for you. This tweet contains no information, and does absolutely
                                    nothing. I've wasted the time you spent reading it. Sorry. </li>
                                <li>As you begin to read this tweet, you have no concept of how it might or might not
                                    change your life. </li>
                                <li>This tweet is hardly even worth the attention of a high-level realized being such
                                    as yourself. Still, there might be something to it. </li>
                                <li>This tweet needs a good cry. It's dejected. It just wants to slink off into some
                                    god-forsaken hole, or desert cave, and practice Zen. </li>
                                <li>This tweet is fresh, young and exuberant! It wants to get to know you in the most
                                    intimate possible way. Will you let it? </li>
                                <li>This tweet is way beyond your stunted capacities. It is too rich even for devas,

                                <li>This tweet is happening RIGHT NOW. Amazing. Can you believe it? Is that shit even

                                <li>There is no possible way of imagining what you might realize about the whole universe
                                    if you plumb the hidden depths of THIS tweet. </li>
                                <li>When you're sitting in meditation, you're one less "person" out there
                                    adding to the world's suffering. This is a great accomplishment. </li>

                                    your neighborhood, but in a jazz club might be intriguing. </li>
                                <li>This tweet feels you are a genuine practitioner. Congratulations! </li>

                                <li>In Zen this is called "wandering hungry and bare-assed in samsara."</li>
                                <li>Originally, Mind is non-locality itself. It's just a clear and empty readiness.
                                    Ready for anything. "Ready or not, here I come!" </li>
                                <li>It's poised, but it doesn't exist yet. It's like the instant before diving into

                                <li>The Earth has a special character "all its own" that makes it precious.
                                    It's renowned in some ways, and much prized; infamous in others. </li>
                                <li>The wise sadhus and yogis and mahasiddhi know it's all a Show -- a wonderful show.
                                    "A fucking awesome spectacle." Wonderful and horrific. </li>
                                <li>You are just Yourself being Itself. </li>
                                <li>Unfortunately, the Earth has a special cosmic reputation for stupidity. We can't
                                    get it together. Even our religions suck. </li>
                                <li>"Extraterrestials" generally regard Earth with the same combination of
                                    distaste and boredom you feel when you think of Chad, or the Sudan. </li>
                                <li>Also, some of the worst "reborn mindstreams" get attracted to Earth, because
                                    here they can not only fuck people over, but prosper doing it. </li>
                                <li>Here on Earth you can even boast and chortle publicly about fucking people over

                                <li>"This one life is everything." Not a bad credo -- if you decide to live
                                    it out fully, rather than exhaust it in intellectual debates. </li>

                                <li>@mujaku My feel on this question you raise is that Buddha thought up all that cool

                                <li>Why not take time to try some "open focus" Zen meditation? You begin by
                                    concentrating on a fixed point until "absorbed." Then, let go. </li>
                                <li>Concentrating on a fixed point eliminates "distractions" (e.g. thoughts,
                                    internal chatter). Letting go spontaneously perfects you. </li>
                                <li>If you do this right -- it's a cool trick -- you effortlessly surpass space and
                                    time. You aren't meditating anymore. You aren't even you. </li>

                                <li>Master Hsi Yun's is a compressed and often considered unsurpassable statement of
                                    Chan. It comes down to "no mental grasping." </li>
                                <li>No mental grasping means no delusions, settling into the clear natural unborn state,
                                    and realizing Buddhahood "between two breaths." </li>

                                    he raised himself from the dead and walked home to India. </li>

                                    -- both manifesting stillness and destroying it. </li>

                                <li>That's why the "starry sky" meditation, or some other form of perception
                                    that relies on "letting go" of the thinking mind, is so important.</li>
                                <li>Don't read Rumi; be Rumi. </li>
                                <li>As soon as you start to get away from thinking-mind and have a glimmer of Clear
                                    Light, people are likely to intensify their demands on you. </li>
                                <li>If you fall unwisely into trying to help and "save" other people rather
                                    than continuing with your solitary practice, the Way is blocked. </li>
                                <li>Everybody speaks of the great loving heart of the Bodhisattva, but what Shakyamuni
                                    did -- abandoning his wife and baby -- was quite harsh. </li>
                                <li>Some would even say that future Buddha behaved like a selfish monster, a man lacking
                                    all compassion or sense of duty. </li>
                                <li>In fact, if you pursue the path of the solitary Yogin realizing the Primordial Clear
                                    Light, this is what some people will say about you. </li>
                                <li>I am just tossing you my notes. Do with them you like. With a "blue-eyed coyote"
                                    now sitting in the house, I feel little need to continue. </li>
                                <li>There is really no "progress" on the path of Clear Light. You don't go
                                    toward it; it's already "in" you and also "is" you. Wake up,
                                    or not. </li>
                                <li>Chasing after external objects obscures It. Finally, you complain that you are lost
                                    -- "wandering bare-assed and hungry in samsara." </li>
                                <li>If you dream that you're drowning in a river, I'd say it is of the utmost importance
                                    -- to "you" at least -- that You wake up. </li>
                                <li>Thinking-mind sifts, judges, compares, and evaluates; Clear Mind wakes up. </li>
                                <li>Suppose you found, in the wilderness, an old, warped and waterstained notebook titled:

                                <li>Those who demand apologies and repentance are quite angry. They just don't see the
                                    anger itself. They see a "social rule" and cling to it. </li>
                                <li>Don't ever demand an apology. Not from anyone. Don't ever insist on confession and
                                    repentance. Not even from yourself. </li>

                                    grievously offended, and I will both apologize and take your place in Hell.</li>

                                    sad. It becomes "who I am." Hey. It's not. </li>

                                <li>He didn't even stick around long enough for me to shower him with flowers, wash

                                <li>I was working on a ridiculous koan at the time. My mind was totally intent on it.
                                    Who knew the answer would be a man? Ecce homo. </li>
                                <li>When it hits you, it hits you out of the blue, and you can't stop it. The Lifegiving

                                <li>"When the wind stops blowing in the big pine tree, where does the sound go?"
                                    That was the koan. </li>
                                <li>There is an obvious intellectual answer. But an intellectual answer isn't an answer
                                    from your whole being. </li>
                                <li>This was the very koan that drove Friedrich Nietzsche crazy in Turin around the
                                    Christmas-New Year season of 1888-89. </li>
                                <li>The koan had personal meaning for me because I saw that the "sound" was
                                    me, and the wind and the pine tree were my "causes." </li>
                                <li>Causes and conditions like my parents ever meeting, there being food for me to eat
                                    and air to breathe, and so on. </li>
                                <li>Like a spoiled brat, I was trying to resolve the whole question of life and death.
                                    What lives? What dies? Where does the sound go? </li>
                                <li>That's the koan. "When wind stops blowing in the big pine tree, where does
                                    the sound go?" </li>
                                <li>That last string of "notes" was directed at the few people who are interested
                                    in that wild kind of stuff. And now, back to your local news. </li>
                                <li>In late-breaking news, a Bengal tiger ate a child at the local zoo. Ouch! That's

                                <li>Dan, I think the tiger is going to be very happy with tomorrow's weather. It's going
                                    to balmy, just like India. Same through the weekend. </li>
                                <li>In the extended forecast, a big asteroid is going to smack into the earth, but not
                                    before the next solar flare fries us like chitlins. Dan? </li>
                                <li>Well, Beverly, it looks like the little tyke that got eaten today won't miss anything
                                    special! Just kidding. Stay tuned for "Nash Bridges." </li>
                                <li>May I clear up a little problem for you? It has to do with Dependent Arising, the
                                    Buddhist teaching. </li>
                                <li>Hold a finger up in front of your face. Shut one eye, then open it while shutting
                                    the other. Do this quickly about twenty times. </li>
                                <li>The logic of Dependent Arising is that the cause of your finger "moving"
                                    is opening and shutting your eyes. </li>
                                <li>But this is the "relative" teaching. The absolute teaching is that your
                                    finger didn't move, not at all. Apply that principle to everything. </li>
                                <li>A Chinese fortune teller once told me I was going to fuck up bigtime. "You

                                <li>Sit in a cemetery at night and do Zen. </li>
                                <li>Eat the banana, toss the peel. Attain the boundless clear light mind, throw away
                                    words. </li>
                                <li>Try getting some energy in your body before you do Zen. Otherwise you're just another
                                    blank-minded corpse on a cushion. </li>
                                <li>Zafu zombies. </li>
                                <li>Fear energy, desire energy, anything. Feel it. Direct it. Intensify it. Make it
                                    a whirling torrent. </li>
                                <li>Thought is energy. But it is very weak energy. It's a wavering shadow of ki. People
                                    who get too engrossed in thoughts become sad. </li>
                                <li>Thoughts are twilight. Then the starry sky appears, naked, shining in all directions.
                                    Why were you born if not to behold This? </li>
                                <li>Shakti wants to leap to your forehead and light up your sky with suns. </li>
                                <li>Shiva is Shakti's adoring slave. Do anything for that seductress, even forget his
                                    clear true nature. </li>
                                <li>Today is the only day. Every other day is but a distant dream. Resolve the great
                                    matter today. Do you proud. Make Shakti smile. Okay? </li>
                                <li>Today is the day to shatter all doubts. To go beyond thoughts. To attain unexcelled
                                    direct mind realization of your original state. </li>
                                <li>It's easy. It could not possibly be easier. It's so simple it's laughable. Just
                                    try to find anything at all that could be called "mind." </li>
                                <li>You can sit, stand, walk, lie down, do qi gong, fuck -- whatever helps you in this
                                    all-out hunt for the real essence of your awareness. </li>
                                <li>But the Mind-hunt has to be intense, total, with nothing held back, not fearing
                                    that you are "ridiculous" nor losing yourself in thoughts. </li>
                                <li>Your attitude has to single-minded, like a samurai hunting through a chaotic battlefield
                                    for the enemy general. </li>
                                <li>Or like a cat in the middle of the night, crouched low, waiting for a mouse to venture
                                    out of its hole. </li>
                                <li>Don't think you're enlightened when you have a concept in mind. Pursue it to the
                                    end. It isn't touchy-feely and fuzzy. It IS shattering. </li>
                                <li>The very thought of "nonduality" can be a supremely frustrating and difficult
                                    obstacle to real direct mind realization. </li>
                                <li>As long as you're thinking "but is this nondual? would my teacher approve?"
                                    you can't possibly break through. No way. </li>
                                <li>Be "dualistic" if you feel it will help in your Mind-hunt. Try it. Go
                                    all the way through. At least you can shatter duality. </li>
                                <li>Nonduality has nothing in it to shatter, so you're likely to just slip into a comfortable
                                    blankness, go to satsangs, smile a lot. </li>
                                <li>The original nature may be intrinsically enlightened, but in your case it's covered
                                    up by a ton of shit. </li>
                                <li>Forget Advaita, Gurdjieff, Zen, breathing-rituals, meditation, classes, gongs, incense,
                                    Master Po, Eckhart Tolle. </li>
                                <li>Your deeply compassionate task is to save all beings from suffering. Completely.
                                    Are you living up to that? </li>
                                <li>If you can't feel drunk "Here and Now" with the brilliant glory of all
                                    This, ablaze with gratitude, you've still got to smash through. </li>
                                <li>Everybody talks to me about being "depressed" and I cannot contain my
                                    amazement anymore. It no longer seems natural. "What? In all This?"</li>
                                <li>People insist on getting acclaim for the infinite specialness of their suffering,
                                    and became enraged when you will not give it to them. </li>
                                <li>My Tibetan teacher (not my "root-guru") kindly began instructing me with
                                    the words: "You must realize you are not a very special person." </li>
                                <li>I must say, this approach dazzled me a little. I think I even choked up with joy.
                                </li>
                                <li>All my life I'd been told by droning fools that I was as special as a snowflake
                                    or a unique crystal dog or something. </li>
                                <li>Here, now, was perhaps the kindest person I'd ever met telling me I was a pretty
                                    mediocre piece of work. At last, the truth. </li>
                                <li>What I'm getting at here is that your suffering is pretty dull and ordinary, but
                                    your Enlightenment will be one-of-a-kind. </li>
                                <li>I wish I could be there to see it! </li>
                            </ol>
