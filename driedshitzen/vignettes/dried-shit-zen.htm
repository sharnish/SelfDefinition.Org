                                <li>Anyone who offends you, arouses a searing flash of blind rage, is your great benefactor.
                                    Will you demand an apology for this precious gift? </li>
                                <li>Produce for me, right here right now, the "you" that "I" so grievously offended,
                                    and I will both apologize and take your place in Hell. </li>
                                <li>It's like dream-jackals stealing the kills of dream-lions. </li>
                                <li>It's like walking uphill on a steep cobblestoned street in Montmartre wearing a
                                    brand new wool scarf. </li>
                                <li>Most people when they're happy grasp at being happy, or when sad cling to being
                                    sad. It becomes "who I am." Hey. It's not. </li>
                                <li>Never is. Never was. Never will be. </li>
                                <li>My feeling, @qjohn, is that he hasn't dissolved into silence, but gone deep.</li>
                                <li>Initial Stages of the Clear Light Yoga: Commitment, Purification, Focus, Cutting
                                    Through, and Absorption. Why not try? </li>
                                <li>A Clear Light yogin uses social rules and graces merely as "cover." He's like an
                                    insect that can resemble a twig. </li>
                                <li>I intend to devote the rest of my tweets to outrageous and deeply offensive personal
                                    attacks, on every last one of you. </li>
                                <li>I'd like to start with that sneaky @jellykish. </li>
                                <li>No it isn't, @nickmattos I know Tantric when I see it, and you are. </li>
                                <li>You, @kyotoghosts, are far too kind to me. You remind me of my sainted grandmother.
                                </li>
                                <li>dried tiger-scrotum for you, @TerrorTV, served on a sparkling white lotus blossom.
                                    That's what I calls some good eatin'. </li>
                                <li>The only Buddha I ever knew died a few years ago. And it was my fault. </li>
                                <li>I received Mind to Mind transmission -- totally unasked for -- courtesy of a homeless
                                    Mahasiddha who wore a rope for a belt. </li>
                                <li>This Clear Sky charlatan had to gaze into my eyes only once, for an instant, to
                                    make his point. </li>
                                <li>He didn't even stick around long enough for me to shower him with flowers, wash
                                    his dirty, sunburnt feet, or give him my clean shirt. </li>
                                <li>I was working on a ridiculous koan at the time. My mind was totally intent on it.
                                    Who knew the answer would be a man? Ecce homo. </li>
                                <li>When it hits you, it hits you out of the blue, and you can't stop it. The Lifegiving
                                    Sword cuts you in two before you can murmur Om. </li>
                                <li>"When the wind stops blowing in the big pine tree, where does the sound go?" That
                                    was the koan. </li>
                                <li>There is an obvious intellectual answer. But an intellectual answer isn't an answer
                                    from your whole being. </li>
                                <li>This was the very koan that drove Friedrich Nietzsche crazy in Turin around the
                                    Christmas-New Year season of 1888-89. </li>
                                <li>Buddha regretted ever opening his mouth about Dependent Arising. </li>
                                <li>The koan had personal meaning for me because I saw that the "sound" was me, and
                                    the wind and the pine tree were my "causes." </li>
                                <li>Causes and conditions like my parents ever meeting, there being food for me to eat
                                    and air to breathe, and so on. </li>
                                <li>Like a spoiled brat, I was trying to resolve the whole question of life and death.
                                    What lives? What dies? Where does the sound go? </li>
                                <li>That's the koan. "When wind stops blowing in the big pine tree, where does the sound
                                    go?" </li>
                                <li>If you can resolve it, tonight I'll picnic with you in the dark. I'll bring the
                                    wine. </li>
                                <li>That last string of "notes" was directed at the few people who are interested in
                                    that wild kind of stuff. And now, back to your local news. </li>
                                <li>In late-breaking news, a Bengal tiger ate a child at the local zoo. Ouch! That's
                                    got to hurt. And now to the weather. Beverly? </li>
                                <li>Dan, I think the tiger is going to be very happy with tomorrow's weather. It's going
                                    to balmy, just like India. Same through the weekend. </li>
                                <li>In the extended forecast, a big asteroid is going to smack into the earth, but not
                                    before the next solar flare fries us like chitlins. Dan? </li>
                                <li>Well, Beverly, it looks like the little tyke that got eaten today won't miss anything
                                    special! Just kidding. Stay tuned for "Nash Bridges." </li>
                                <li>May I clear up a little problem for you? It has to do with Dependent Arising, the
                                    Buddhist teaching. </li>
                                <li>Some very big fat tomes have been written on it, and lamas and tulkus have plunged
                                    into bitter and complicated disputes on just this. </li>
                                <li>However, DriedShitZen is going to clear it up for you in the next three tweets,
                                    max. </li>
                                <li>Hold a finger up in front of your face. Shut one eye, then open it while shutting
                                    the other. Do this quickly about twenty times. </li>
                                <li>The logic of Dependent Arising is that the cause of your finger "moving" is opening
                                    and shutting your eyes. </li>
                                <li>But this is the "relative" teaching. The absolute teaching is that your finger didn't
                                    move, not at all. Apply that principle to everything. </li>
                                <li>Don't get all excited about enlightenment, man. It's pretty boring. </li>
                                <li>Loving the Dream, bitches. </li>
                                <li>RT @Zen_Guy: Boredom doesn't describe my meditation.>>Then you're not enlightened.

                                <li>A Chinese fortune teller once told me I was going to fuck up bigtime. "You fuck
                                    up bigtime, Dryshitzen!" </li>
                                <li>Nothing is more ludicrous for a yogin than to have ideas about friends or enemies,
                                    let alone who is truly "enlightened" and who isn't. </li>

                                <li>"We're all in the starry sky," as @kyotoghosts, my Grandmother Coyote Guardian Spirit,
                                    says. </li>
                                <li>If you feel your life is boring, or you're hurt, or trapped, or depressed, go up
                                    onto a mountain and meditate all the time. Do shugyo. </li>
                                <li>Pour ice-water on your head every morning. Shout. </li>
                                <li>Sit in a cemetery at night and do Zen. </li>
                                <li>When you feel the possibility of malign "spirits" or rapacious ghosts breathing
                                    down your neck, you'll know when you're doing Zen "right." </li>
                                <li>Zen masters have gone up the mountains for 0 day retreats eating only pine needles
                                    and drinking only rainwater. Why couldn't you? </li>
                                <li>Stop intellectualizing. Shatter thought. Develop clear perception. Let go and be
                                    absorbed into the inner "light." </li>
                                <li>But the Mind-hunt has to be intense, total, with nothing held back, not fearing
                                    that you are "ridiculous" nor losing yourself in thoughts. </li>
                                <li>Your attitude has to single-minded, like a samurai hunting through a chaotic battlefield
                                    for the enemy general. </li>
                                <li>Or like a cat in the middle of the night, crouched low, waiting for a mouse to venture
                                    out of its hole. </li>
                                <li>Don't think you're enlightened when you have a concept in mind. Pursue it to the
                                    end. It isn't touchy-feely and fuzzy. It IS shattering. </li>
                                <li>The very thought of "nonduality" can be a supremely frustrating and difficult obstacle
                                    to real direct mind realization. </li>
                                <li>As long as you're thinking "but is this nondual? would my teacher approve?" you
                                    can't possibly break through. No way. </li>
                                <li>Be "dualistic" if you feel it will help in your Mind-hunt. Try it. Go all the way
                                    through. At least you can shatter duality. </li>
                                <li>Nonduality has nothing in it to shatter, so you're likely to just slip into a comfortable
                                    blankness, go to satsangs, smile a lot. </li>
                                <li>The original nature may be intrinsically enlightened, but in your case it's covered
                                    up by a ton of shit. </li>
                                <li>Forget Advaita, Gurdjieff, Zen, breathing-rituals, meditation, classes, gongs, incense,
                                    Master Po, Eckhart Tolle. </li>
                                <li>Your deeply compassionate task is to save all beings from suffering. Completely.
                                    Are you living up to that? </li>
                                <li>If you can't feel drunk "Here and Now" with the brilliant glory of all This, ablaze
                                    with gratitude, you've still got to smash through. </li>
                                <li>Everybody talks to me about being "depressed" and I cannot contain my amazement
                                    anymore. It no longer seems natural. "What? In all This?" </li>
                                <li>People insist on getting acclaim for the infinite specialness of their suffering,
                                    and became enraged when you will not give it to them. </li>
                                <li>My Tibetan teacher (not my "root-guru") kindly began instructing me with the words:
                                    "You must realize you are not a very special person." </li>
                                <li>I must say, this approach dazzled me a little. I think I even choked up with joy.
                                </li>
                                <li>All my life I'd been told by droning fools that I was as special as a snowflake
                                    or a unique crystal dog or something. </li>
                                <li>Here, now, was perhaps the kindest person I'd ever met telling me I was a pretty
                                    mediocre piece of work. At last, the truth. </li>
                                <li>What I'm getting at here is that your suffering is pretty dull and ordinary, but
                                    your Enlightenment will be one-of-a-kind. </li>
                                <li>I wish I could be there to see it! </li>
                                <li>Eat the banana, toss the peel. Attain the boundless clear light mind, throw away
                                    words. </li>
                                <li>Try getting some energy in your body before you do Zen. Otherwise you're just another
                                    blank-minded corpse on a cushion. </li>
                                <li>Zafu zombies. </li>
                                <li>Fear energy, desire energy, anything. Feel it. Direct it. Intensify it. Make it
                                    a whirling torrent. </li>
                                <li>Thought is energy. But it is very weak energy. It's a wavering shadow of ki. People
                                    who get too engrossed in thoughts become sad.</li>
                                <li>Thoughts are twilight. Then the starry sky appears, naked, shining in all directions.
                                    Why were you born if not to behold This? </li>
                                <li>Shakti wants to leap to your forehead and light up your sky with suns. </li>
                                <li>Shiva is Shakti's adoring slave. Do anything for that seductress, even forget his
                                    clear true nature.</li>
                                <li>Today is the only day. Every other day is but a distant dream. Resolve the great
                                    matter today. Do you proud. Make Shakti smile. Okay?</li>
                                <li>Today is the day to shatter all doubts. To go beyond thoughts. To attain unexcelled
                                    direct mind realization of your original state.</li>
                                <li>It's easy. It could not possibly be easier. It's so simple it's laughable. Just
                                    try to find anything at all that could be called "mind." </li>
                                <li>You can sit, stand, walk, lie down, do qi gong, fuck -- whatever helps you in this
                                    all-out hunt for the real essence of your awareness. </li>
                                <li>But the Mind-hunt has to be intense, total, with nothing held back, not fearing
                                    that you are "ridiculous" nor losing yourself in thoughts. </li>
                                <li>Your attitude has to single-minded, like a samurai hunting through a chaotic battlefield
                                    for the enemy general. </li>
                                <li>Or like a cat in the middle of the night, crouched low, waiting for a mouse to venture
                                    out of its hole. </li>
                                <li>Don't think you're enlightened when you have a concept in mind. Pursue it to the
                                    end. It isn't touchy-feely and fuzzy. It IS shattering. </li>
                                <li>The very thought of "nonduality" can be a supremely frustrating and difficult obstacle
                                    to real direct mind realization. </li>
                                <li>Nonduality has nothing in it to shatter, so you're likely to just slip into a comfortable
                                    blankness, go to satsangs, smile a lot.</li>
                                <li>The original nature may be intrinsically enlightened, but in your case it's covered
                                    up by a ton of shit. </li>
                                <li>Forget Advaita, Gurdjieff, Zen, breathing-rituals, meditation, classes, gongs, incense,
                                    Master Po, Eckhart Tolle. </li>
                                <li>Your deeply compassionate task is to save all beings from suffering. Completely.
                                    Are you living up to that? </li>
