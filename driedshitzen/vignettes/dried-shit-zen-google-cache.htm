                                <li>"Subhuti, what do you say? Does a rabbit with horns exist, or not?" </li>
                                <li>"Venerable One, it does not really exist, but has been falsely conceived by some,
                                    therefore, to them at least, it does." </li>
                                <li>"Excellent, Subhuti. It is just like this. A mortal world has been falsely conceived
                                    by some and to them exists, but we know it does not." </li>
                                <li>"Subhuti, what do you think? If a young buck like yourself were as generous with
                                    your sexual attentions with as many widows -- " </li>
                                <li>"as there are sand grains in the Ganges, using as many erect cocks as there are
                                    stars in the sky, would this be a lot?" </li>
                                <li>"Plenty, Venerable Master." "Well, Subhuti, memorizing just one verse of this Dried
                                    Shit Zen Sutra will get you even more merit than that!" </li>
                                <li>Nobody knows what the mind is. This is simply a fact. But Buddha went further. He
                                    said that it is impossible to "know" what mind is. </li>
                                <li>What is mind? Where is your mind right now? What is it doing? Can you find it?</li>
                                <li>Why would you merely trust what a Guru or Rinpoche or Roshi tells you about the
                                    mind, and senselessly repeat his or her words? </li>
                                <li>There is always the path of direct realization, whereby your original nature becomes
                                    manifest to you in a striking way free of "teachings." </li>
                                <li>But nobody wants to follow this path. Instead, you'll pick up on somebody saying
                                    something and get excited. </li>
                                <li>"Wow! Mind is luminous!" Yes, if you realized it for yourself, that word "luminous"
                                    might have some meaning. </li>
                                <li>"Dried shit is the original Buddha! That's so funny and so apt!" If only you knew.
                                </li>
                                <li>It doesn't matter who is "ahead of" or "behind" you in terms of realization. This
                                    is all just delusion, false conceiving. </li>
                                <li>After all, the mind you have to realize is the mind as it's working in you. Right
                                    now. Whether it's the "same" as Universal Mind: who knows? </li>
                                <li>Knowing something intellectually is a very dim shadow of instantaneous realization.
                                </li>
                                <li>@ArielBravy. Keep it cool, baby. Watch it and enjoy it but always be cool. </li>
                                <li>This is a tweet about this precious opportunity -- this human life. I will say no
                                    more. </li>
                                <li>A monk asked: "Not producing a single thought, can there be any fault?" Yunmen answered,
                                    "Mount Sumeru." </li>
                                <li>Whatever marvelous awakening you experience, it's all going to come back to living
                                    an everyday life. Isn't that fantastic? </li>
