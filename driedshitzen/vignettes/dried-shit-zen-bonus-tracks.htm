                                Chronological order - predates and leads up to the long version</p>
                            <ol class="generic tall">
                                <li>Buddha was a great Rishi. His comprehensive theory of the cosmos, Dependent Arising,
                                    is unmatched for depths and logical rigor. </li>
                                <li>With that theory in hand, you can dismiss all metaphysical speculation, all religion,
                                    and concentrate solely on ending suffering. </li>
                                <li>It's an odd fact that you can be absorbed in Clear Light and fully enjoy the objects
                                    of the senses, but you cannot desire them. </li>
                                <li>Desire shatters the Clear Light, or at least in an illusory way it does, and plunges
                                    you into the anguish of constant attraction/revulsion. </li>
                                <li>It's with desire that a "you" arises that seems so defined, so extraordinary, so
                                    different from others. </li>
                                <li>That "sticking" to particular phenomena is cemented in place by thoughts. </li>
                                <li>In fact, your desire energy is extraordinary. "You" in this sense are extraordinary.
                                    Your desire is Shakti with an accent mark. </li>
                                <li>Do not give up your desire so easily, just because Buddha says you should, or a
                                    Zen master says you should. </li>
                                <li>Shatter yourself on it! </li>
                                <li>Shakti gives you this extraordinary desire. Why? Don't know. Maybe she longs for
                                    the itch of Shiva's unshaven face. </li>
                                <li>Desire has sprung up everywhere. It has turned into thoughts. In that sense, "duality"
                                    is a fact. We are duality. Is this not wonderful?</li>
                                <li>Get up at 2:00 AM and do some direct non-conceptual Clear Light realizing. After
                                    all, it works best when your thinking-mind is exhausted. </li>
                                <li>Buddha's simple meditative technique got muddled in the transmission as the Dharma
                                    was ritualized and intellectualized. </li>
                                <li>Originally it was probably something like this: Meditating, watch all that arises
                                    and falls, including thoughts, desires, sensations, etc. </li>
                                <li>Fully see that these impermanent objects, taken alone or in combination, cannot
                                    possibly be the "I," the "Atman," the "Subject." </li>
                                <li>Fully experience the absolute, shocking "duality" of A) Perception and B) all perceived
                                    objects (including the sensory organs, etc). </li>
                                <li>I give much credit to @mujaku and his "Dark Zen" collaborators for recognizing all
                                    this and clearly stating the case for Atman. </li>
                                <li>But grasping at "luminous Mind" as Self, totally distinct from the five skandhas,
                                    is just creating another straw dog. </li>
                            </ol><br />
