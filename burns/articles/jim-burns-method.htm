							<h4>
								Free Association
							</h4>
							<p>
								We were talking about free association other night and someone brought a point up. This
								point has to be brought up. When I was doing this, I had no one to talk to. I had no one
								to turn to. I had no place to go to discuss things. So apparently, the forces that exist
								decided that they were going to give me the special gift of teaching me how to do my own
								learning, how to do my own teaching, how to do my own insighting. I learned how to free
								associate. I asked myself the questions that would take me out of the blind spots. Most
								people doing this get into a blind spot, get into a thought that becomes repetitive, and
								they're done. You don't know where to go with it.
							</p>
							<p>
								People get into a blind spot and might stay there for the rest of their life. I didn't
								have that problem. I learned to ask myself the questions: What does it look like? What
								does it feel like? What does it seem like? What does it act like? &ndash; endlessly
								asking myself questions. Until suddenly there was one thought that was blank and would
								go no further. The free association word wouldn't yield anything like the release
								necessary. I would change just one little inflection in the words as I repeated them in
								my mind, just one little inflection. I'd ask myself: What does this mean? What does it
								suggest? What does that make me think of? I never found one of them that I didn't find
								my way out of whatever trap I got into by doing that. I don't know anybody else that
								knows how to guide themselves out of that hole. I can guide someone else out of a hole,
								but I can't seem to teach them how to do it themselves.
							</p>
							<p>

								Everything you went through in your lifetime and haven't resolved is still sitting there
								waiting to be worked on. Either you get straight with some of this stuff, or you'll wish
								you had. It is a mountain of work. You don't deal with each individual circumstance but
								with the abstraction of the problem. You deal with the still existing patterns. You
								don't deal with the individual circumstances of things in your life. The singular
								psychological patterns that maintain presently held values and patterns of thinking are
								what you deal with. You don't deal with the individual circumstances that gradually
								imbued you with one particular aspect or complex. Even then it is a mountain of work.
							</p>
							<p>

								The ability of getting a feeling to translate into words is a tricky business, but it is
								well worth the effort. When some insight comes up, you should stop everything you are
								doing, if at all possible, and pay attention to it. If a word associated with a current
								feeling comes up, it is often extremely important. Repeat the word until you get some
								sense of what it means. It is often a word at the crossroads of other concepts, and ties
								them together. Before you couldn't figure out how this tied into this or this tied into
								that. You begin to build a structure and develop comprehension.
							</p>

							<p>

								If you hold center on a problem long enough, things will open up. It is difficult when
								you are first trying this. It takes awhile to develop the expertise. Sometimes the
								effort of trying to hold center and bring something up is so great that you simply can't
								do it. It takes practice. You are facing a void because you don't what you are looking
								for. If you keep mentally facing forward, it will eventually focus itself. You will
								focus what your inner nature is seeking. If there wasn't an unanswered and even
								misstated question you wouldn't be doing this. At this point the question isn't even
								formed. You just know that there has to be a better state than that which you are
								currently in. The unanswered is what you are seeking.
								It is difficult to stay on the point when thinking about something. It may be something
								is so painful to you that the mind will keep drifting to almost anything to get off the
								painful thought. When facing the unknown, the key is overcoming the fear. You must have
								faith that it will work. Fear is absolutely the hallmark that you are getting near
								something important. When you get to this fear you know something you are looking for
								will be found. You know that you've found a hot spot.

							<h4>
								Consistency &amp; Technique
							</h4>
							<p>
								You have to have consistency in doing this and facing it to produce results. You can't
								meditate this week, do it again next week, and then let it go. You'll wind up always
								going back to the beginning. On the other hand, don't expect too much of yourself. When
								it gets too hot, let it go for awhile. The next time around you'll be a little closer
								when you start and you'll go a little farther before uncomfortable again.
								If you're being bothered by something, I've found that if you let your body run the
								show, just laying horizontal, that all the things that wander around in your mind will
								drift off. You'll start getting a feeling that an important thought is coming. It's a
								physical feeling that a thought is coming up into your brain. As soon as this happens,
								you know you're on the road home. The pain diminishes and you start realizing what is
								disturbing you.
							</p>
							<p>
								Learning this technique is like learning a new language. The first couple of times it is
								not going to be very effective. You just have to lay there and be quiet until the
								problem comes to the surface. You have to face forward into the void, as it were, a type
								of tunnel vision. Ideas will come to you and eventually one will come that really hits
								the gong about problems you are facing. Different ideas will come to fill that void. The
								thing that is hard about it, when you're first attempting it, is to realize that you're
								searching for something you presently have no answer to. It is hard to realize that you
								are putting effort into putting something where there is now nothing, as far as
								consciousness is concerned. I came upon this method instinctively. For the first year I
								wondered what the heck I was trying to do. Finally it started to work. This, meditation
								and dreams is where I've learned everything, I never learned anything from a book.
								You may unconsciously be chastising that inner work is not a good of time and energy.
								You may be prejudiced against your own thinking to what someone else says or you read in
								a book. You have to think as much of your own thoughts as do of somebody else's. In any
								effort you start out from zero. You may feel foolish about the things you are thinking
								about but you have to start somewhere. You have to realize that you are trying to be a
								student of yourself and that it is a good effort.

							<h4>
								Comprehension
							</h4>
							<p>
								I was stumbling around with meditation and I discovered that if something was bothering
								me and an answer to the problem occurred to me, then it stopped bothering me. So when
								something started bothering me I knew I was looking for a specific answer, which was the
								golden key to the thing. Little did I realize how much work it would be. At first you
								don't know what you are seeking. Once you make the discovery of this inner satisfaction,
								then you know what you are seeking for. You're blind to it for quite awhile. You just
								know things aren't what you'd like, but you aren't able to be specific about it. Our
								major appetite is the need to comprehend. Comprehension is a specific appetite and even
								needs to understand itself. You need to know what the mind is trying to get done so you
								can be more effective at it. Your internal system is entirely capable, given the
								opportunity, to teach you what it is trying to teach you. Your inner being knows. Your
								outer being is always unknowing.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your system is constantly trying to get some inner job done. It is constantly trying to
								get you conscious of what is distressing you. Secondly, it is trying to get you to
								comprehend what natural laws and patterns that distress is involved with. To know where
								the mistake is so you can evade making the mistake and start going with the natural
								flow. This is all built in by design. Try to place the problem mentally in front of you
								and let every tension go out of your body. Let the thing just hang in front of you.
								Gradually a word will come to mind that will begin to explain and alleviate the
								circumstances. The words form so long as you hold that center. It is uncomfortable,
								miserable, and the only thing that is worse is what you're trying to escape. If it is
								something superficial, you can deal with it superficially. If it is a deeper problem,
								you have to pinpoint what is bothering you. To find out what it is you have to stay on
								center on the problem and not slip off the point. Sometimes a flash of insight might
								come which lasts but milliseconds. If you miss it, you can only get back to that insight
								by plodding and working step by step.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can bring on insight experiences if you learn how. You have to let go of the trivia.
								But you have to learn what the trivia is in reference to what you are seeking. It may
								not be trivia in all situations. Some insight might come up when you're at a business
								meeting. Now to me, for the time being, the meeting would be trivia because it is mere
								readily accessible, and I'd have to get away. Maybe excuse myself to go to the bathroom,
								to get at the source of what's coming up. You may have to try to get a handle on it by
								repeating the word or concept over and over to yourself. When you get a handle on it,
								you can keep it to get back to later. If you let it go, it may not come again. It is a
								way of life. You don't want to give your job away, but you have to do what is ever
								possible.

							<h4>
								Forgetting
							</h4>
							<p>
								When you run the gamut of concentrating on something, you may want to take a break or
								forget it for awhile. Just when you take your mind off it, is when answers to you other
								problems will often come into view. This is a good thing to know from the methodological
								standpoint. The reason for it is very simple. When you are keyed up and putting a lot of
								energy into a problem, the minute you let go of the problem, all the energy has to go
								somewhere, and it goes to whatever the next problem is on your agenda in priority basis,
								even if you don't know consciously what your next priorities problem may be. The second
								you break off concentration, a slight dizziness sets in because of the change in
								concentration levels. That is when the answers will come in. The more you do this
								switching back and forth of levels, the more effective this process and information is.
								As soon as you take this high energy level off the problem you are focusing on, it will
								escape to the next energy level, like a spark crossing the gap in a sparkplug. Until you
								are good at it, you won't notice it. It will just go flashing by.

							<h4>
								Like a Scanner
							</h4>
							<p>
								There is a free association part of the mind that is like a citizen's band scanner,
								constantly going up and down the channels. Your inner mind is constantly trying to get
								your outer self aware of what's going on within yourself until you've answered to that
								need. It keeps throwing balls over the fence. As you drive down the road your mind will
								constantly pick out this fence or that tree, or this sign. You' re accustomed to it and
								assume that everyone else's mind does the same thing. If you analyzed why you pick this
								or that to see out of everything that is available, there is a definite reason and
								pattern to it. It follows very closely the things that come in ordinary dreaming (which
								is another method of throwing balls over the fence.) The dream-maker uses these things
								in waking life. They are attempts to guide you to what in you is unfulfilled.

							<h4>
								Dreams
							</h4>
							<p>
								When I was young I learned that dreams were the source of all necessary information.
								It's good to go to sleep slowly and to wake up slowly. If you have a nagging dream, just
								lie in bed and be quiet. Try and be conscious of no-thing, which is different than
								nothing. Just let it come to you. All the pictography of the dream is an attempt by the
								inner stage master to throw things over the fence to key you in to what is happening in
								your insides. Through dreams you can repair the bridge to the inner self and again
								become a whole person. Realizing something in a dream isn't enough; you have to become
								aware of it in the waking state.
							</p>
							<p>
								When I was good at dreams, several times I was able to go deep inside myself and hear
								the dream and actually be able to see it, and get a person to repeat what they said time
								after time until I was able to re-experience the dream. In interpreting my dreams, what
								I would do when I woke up was to go all the way back to the crossover state. The
								feelings that the dreams elicit are the things that tell you what the dream means, so
								you have to be able to go right back into it. Whatever the same feelings are that would
								occur to you when you are awake, is what the dream is trying to get to. The real point
								in dreams is to get it to come back so clearly that you get all the feelings as they
								went by.

							<a class="page-link-anchor" id="seeing-yourself">&nbsp;</a>
							<h4>
								Seeing Yourself
							</h4>
							<p>
								Your inner mind is using all opportunities at all times to get you to look at something
								about yourself. When I had my mind and could use it, every time I found somebody I
								didn't like, invariably I would discover that they had something that I didn't think I
								could ever have. But the process of going from the initial dislike to the discovery of
								the secret jealousy took me months every time to work my way through it. As I'd go
								through the process of discovering specifically what characteristics I was so jealous
								about, I'd find out that the person really didn't even possess the characteristics.
							</p>
							<p>
								My mind was just using the characteristic to bait me, to bring into my awareness
								something about my own values. That there is something that I consider to be important
								inside that I'm not consciously aware of. Your mind only uses these circumstances to
								bring your attention to something. When the washout was over with, what I would find out
								about the situation was that there was something that I valued that I never realized
								that I valued. My mind was just using the opportunity to bring it into view. You can't
								know what your real attitudes are until you get good at inner work. It's the only way
								you can find out.
							</p>
							<p>
								Use your mind to see what are the implications of everything. It is an offense against a
								very offensive reality. You can do something about it. The people who can't do anything
								about it are the 99% of the population that don't know what hit them. The minute you see
								you can do something about it, you cease to be one of those people, although it may take
								awhile before it dawns on you.

							<h4>
								What Brought You?
							</h4>
							<p>
								The classic idea about going to a psychiatrist is that they set you down and want to
								know about your past. I don't want to know anything about the past, but about what
								brought the person in today. It is like a person looking for their glasses, and where
								are they? &ndash; right on their head. If I had been an analyst, a lot of the type of
								material I'd have written is in D.W. Winnicott's book, <em>The Maturational
									Process</em>. <sup>[1]</sup> You couldn't spend enough time on it.

								You don't have to remember anything, traumas and the like. You are never dealing with
								anything except what is right here. How long it has been there is another aspect. The
								Freudian notion that you can go into your past and set yourself free is totally false.
								They only achieve remembering things. That has nothing to do with it. You have to deal
								with the weird things you are doing now, that you started doing back then. You don't
								have to remember anything.

								Deepest Past as the Real Now
							</h4>
							<p>
								When you find the deepest past as the real now... In other words, when you find that
								deep past, the real now will never be the same again. When you realize that something
								you started nearly from the moment you were born is something you are doing right now,
								it instantaneously changes and will never be the same again. You don't go back. You go
								along the surface until you find the past in it. You don't go anywhere. It's all right
								here. It never really went anyplace. It' s still here.

							<h4>
								Freedom and Will
							</h4>
							<p>
								"The Truth will set you free." There are times you are set free and you don't even know
								what the truth was that did it. You have to search for the concept that expresses it. It
								is important to search for the concept. When you find the concept that sets you free
								from something, and you understand how it explains a natural process that was aborted
								and then brought back on track, you experience a shift of realities that will take you
								away from the mundane for all time, the first time it happens. It can happen in a
								repetitive stream for half a lifetime. You are never again caught in the surface of
								things. You can withdraw from the surface of things and see the overriding influence
								that causes situations. The first time you escape the surface of things, you are
								relieved of it and never caught or bound in it again.
							</p>
							<p>
								Nobody knows this when they are studying themselves. They stumble along and fall into it
								and get set loose from the whole thing. Sometimes they think they've lost all their
								sense of reality, because reality is never perceived again as the same thing from that
								time on. Reality is a matter of concepts. Up until this point, the most real thing in
								life is a hammer. After you've crossed this invisible line, the concept of "hammer" is
								much more real that the hammer itself. Without the concept, you could not have the
								hammer, but up until this point you couldn't appreciate the importance of that thought.
							</p>
							<p>
								The usual meaning of choice, the usual meaning of will, the usual meaning of
								self-determination are linguistic concepts that are darn near necessary. I accept the
								unfoldment of me before the only audience that matters &ndash; me. I long ago came to
								the realization that it has been completely out of my hands from the beginning. I know
								I've had nothing to do with what I've gone through. I've been the little character that
								sits at the crossroads. Nothing more, nothing less.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have not had the opportunity that most people have had of being in the ordinary sense
								self-determining. They determine what they want to do, go out and do it, and have a
								reasonable amount of success. They pay their own bills and are able to do what they call
								"stand on their own feet." They have the ego support involved in it and it becomes a
								large part of their view of themselves. You must remember that I have had none of this.
								The body is built to answer to the first necessity. Get the bills paid. Get the food on.
								Get the house in shape. My hunch is that the only reason I can still put up with life is
								because of the experiences I've had. For me to continue life makes no sense.

								Depression

								A friend was talking last night about the fact that he gets so despondent. He'll get a

								He'll be uplifted by the passing flood of insights, even about minute things but mostly
								the seeing into important things he's been blind to. Then he'll go to bed one night and
								wake up completely in a hole and not know how he got there. The insight is gone. He

								I really raised his eyebrows when I told him that the whole point of the conscious
								effort, the whole thing you want about insight, is the insight to insight. You want to
								be able to get to the point where you can see how to bring insight into the hole, to
								keep it from crushing all the progress. That's the only impediment to an endless,
								continual consciousness of insight, which is what I finally got to. The key was to seek
								and pray, literally pray, for the insight to see what causes the depressions, because
								the depressions are what destroy everything.

								Every time you have a specific fall into a depression, some one, specific emotional
								experience is involved in it, and only one. There can be a string of depressions caused
								by different emotions. When you resolve and dispel one big depression through conscious
								effort and insight &ndash; if you ever accomplish this once, you've learned the root to
								dispelling all depression. Free association is the biggest key. Also, you conquer the
								hopelessness by facing it.

								The minute you can generate a goal, depression dies. The thing about depression is that
								you can't generate a goal. A negative long-span thinking situation is always a case of
								the dog chasing his tail.
								To be genuinely clear, which doesn't have anything to do with Scientology's "clear," is
								to have answered every question you have had to date, and I've been there on a regular
								basis. If that isn't paradise, I don't know what is. It is to have taken every feeling
								that ever came into your comprehension and to have traced it all the way back to its
								roots.
							</p>
							<p>
								A funny thing about depression is that it takes just as much effort as it does to be
								positive, but you end up with totally different results. The activity itself is not so
								much the key as what it produces. Being positive about things is equally as real as
								being negative. You have the same input, different outlook and results. The only way you
								can determine better or not between them is by what they produce. Between them they both
								suffice.
								If you let negativity get hold of you, it becomes consuming and you are negative about
								everything. There is nothing worse and more draining than having to hate. About the only
								way you can correct it is to be positive about little things at a time.
