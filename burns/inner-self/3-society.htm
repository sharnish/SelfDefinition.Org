									3. SOCIETY
								</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								By design everybody from the beginning of mankind until now, starts with the notion that life is a bed of roses, its nothing but kicks, a glory road. That's the way your mind points when you are born. Our mind is of such a nature that it cannot survive and won't work without a fantasy, a fantasy that has nothing to do with reality. If you get stuck looking at too much reality, you're going to come apart at the seams. Life will become meaningless and your mind will refuse to have anything to do with it. The longer you live, if you live long enough and can maintain any essence of sanity, you discover that these fantasies are built into your head to keep you putting up with it. You may get to the point where you're not willing to put up with it under any circumstances, and your mind collapses, which is what happened to me.</p>
							<p>
								The whole of society is endlessly trying to make good on things that are worthless. They spend their lifetime pumping themselves up with fantasy because they can't stand the facts. By design you are extremely limited from this physical side as to what you're supposed to be concerned with. You cannot maintain interest in what you're not designed to be playing with. Although we're designed to look at the world a certain way, when you start calling this basic design &quot;pollyanna,&quot; you are in trouble over your eyealls.</p>
							<p>
								Anything that pays the bills or works in the everyday world, including psychological systems, is never able to be rejected or seen for its errors. As long as you pay the bills, you have little chance of escaping your thought patterns. You never get to see how things are on the other side of the street, so to speak. If it works, it is self-maintaining, including all the mistakes built into the mind set.</p>
							<p>
								The average person has a set of succeeding habits designed to master the simple production of livelihood and never seriously questions life unless he has a disasterous defeat. You are incapable of it. Knowing this is necessary in order to understand people's personal psychologies. You never get to the other side of the street because you are satisfied with what is on your side. This is why the older a person gets, the narrower their inner options get. They've been successful so long looking at things one way. We're creatures of habit. We want to have all the answers out in front of us and everything ready. That's why a person always goes back to his old answers. You're in a dilemna. You do want to change, but you don't want to change. It's threatening and painful to change. The essence of change is discomfort. People only go as far as they need to go.</p>
							<p>
								There are very few people who have the capacity to separate themselves from the people around them. Familiarity breeds contempt. You don't knowingly heap yourself with your own abuse, you heap somebody else with it. This is all to answer to getting the crops in. When you are threatened, you &quot;dump&quot; it on everyone and anyone that is available in order to get free enough to be able to do the day's work. You've got to get free enough to be able to do the day's work done, pay the bills, and get fed. It all comes back to that first necessity of survival that we're all painfully grinding on. All of us.</p>
							<p>
								The average person due to the needs of the functions of projection and transference, is out working on somebody else all the time without knowing they are doing it, trying to discharge their own anxieties. Some actually live on other people's pain. It's what keeps them going and how they get their feeling of effectiveness. Their unconscious reactions come out as sadism, which give the person enough of a day to day high to keep on going. Transference, projection and the like obviously work, because they keep people out of the booby hatch.</p>
							<p>
								People keep to themselves because of the threat of being blown out of their own mental cocoon. People who can't stand to have other people in their home or go out in public are on such a tight little island because they are sitting on the killing urge. They feel so terribly threatened that they have to go to all of these extremes to keep from killing something. They have to walk in a tight little circle.</p>
							<p>
								You may not be as fragile when you get out of childhood and adolescence, but no one is autonomous. Can you actually say you can get by without any good experience? You never get autonomous from your family. Your family extends into your peer group and you die dealing with your family and peer group. The only thing you have to take into the foray is the mind-set that was cast upon you as a child and that you cannot change.</p>
							<p>
								If you like a person you are inclined to show it to them. While some people avoid others, some see their solutions in others. With the security-seeking type of person, you are always being tested. They are incapable of a level relationship with somebody. They can only be inferior or superior. It is because of their desire to work out of the environment the factor they need to feel secure. But, so long as you are seeking security, you cannot achieve it. This is a broad-based characteristic in many people and oddly nearly has become the basis of our society.</p>
							<p>
								You are in a social circumstance as long as you still remember your last face to face confrontation or are under the influence of it. Your entire being is affected. This applies whether the confrontation was verbal or nonverbal. The point is that you have to become aware that as long as you are within eyeshot or earshot, you are constantly being affected by the internal condition of those around you. If they have no idea of their internal turmoil, then it is left for you to deal with, which is how most people get along.</p>
							<p>
								If the average person's mind were hooked to a loudspeaker and you could hear what went through it, you would probably look for the highest building around so you could be dead the first time. You are walking around in a reality that is the production of this common consciousness. There are very few who understand the functions that the mind is trying to fulfill and maintain. My view of the common consciousness is that it is a trash heap, a mouldering dung heap. How many people do you know who are clearly conscious of and broad and deeply versed in the information required to insure that their children will have insight, understanding and wisdom?</p>
							<p>
								Normal people would do anything on earth to avoid talking about or looking at what goes on in their own head. That thought lead me to the first clear insight I ever had: &quot;These people are crazy!&quot; I was just a kid. Then I spent a year on who was crazy. They were out there living in the world and I was just a kid. They paid the bills but were scared to death of their own heads. So I was crazy, but who was sane? Something that helped me was the thought that I was crazy, but that it was a perfectly normal reaction to the circumstance. That left me off a big hook.</p>
							<p>
								People defend themselves from their own best interests, and don't know how to stop it. The objective is to get a natural process to come back into operation. It comes back into operation spontaneously. You stumble onto it and then you learn how to use it. The whole thing is that you have an ego set up, without knowing how it came into existence or the ramifications of it, that prevents you. It has to leak through, or trick you out of the way, so to speak, so you can get out there where you can see things.</p>
							<p>
								In this world there are two available mind-sets. One direction is to experience Truth, to know what it means to light your whole body up with insight, to make it your highest goal, to have the experience of overwhelming insight and comprehension of the whole realm of human experience. That's one mind-set or direction that accounts for maybe one hundreth of one percent of the total. The entire rest of the mind-sets is what you are involved in in everyday life, and is running away from the first mind-set. You are terrified by it. Everything everybody does is designed to destroy the possibility of ever getting to the first mind-set. That is the big problem.</p>
							<p>
								The average person's mind is full of so much tripe and garbage, and is so far divorced from understanding what is going on here, that the miracle is that anything gets accomplished. If it weren't for mankind's capability of reducing complex tasks into simple repetitive tasks, we'd have nothing. If it required a creative imagination every minute to survive, the survival rate would be zero. The average mind is a garbage heap that is ninety-nine percent disabled.</p>
							<p>
								My view is that through our capacity to reduce things to simple elements, and resultantly the ability to maintain vast hordes of people in a very materially comfortable life through simple efforts, that we've finally gotten to the point where we've bought enough time for a few people who have the genetic propensity, to be the resolvers, the true researchers, the perceivers of new information and insight into the workings of the mind. We finally have the circumstances where they can maintain themselves while trying to do this work.</p>
							<p>
								If we survive without a nuclear war, which I don't think we will, but if we should happen to, and get another 300 years or so of working on consciousness, we will have in fact the Garden of Eden. If we could train people to have the capacity to come to their own fulfillment in minding their own business instead of somebody else's business, we would have such a blissful state on earth that it truly would be the Garden of Eden. That's my view of what could be.</p>
