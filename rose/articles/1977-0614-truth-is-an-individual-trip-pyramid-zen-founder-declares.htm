							<p>
								Members of the Pyramid Zen Society here are seeking truth, and although their leader says he has found the truth, he won't tell his followers what it is.
							</p>
							<p>
								Truth is not something you can teach, Richard Rose believes; you have to find it for yourself.
							</p>
							<p>
								Rose, a former contractor from Wheeling, W. Va., founded branches of his society in Pittsburgh, Wheeling, Columbus and Kent, Ohio, all of them associated mainly with college students.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;The object of the society is to answer all questions,&quot; Rose said.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;There are three basic questions: Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going? Strangely, most religions try to answer only one of these questions.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								Rose uses Zen, a contemplative form of Buddhism, to find the answers. But Zen isn't the only way, he added.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;There is not a major religion on earth without people who have found the light. Many systems work just as Zen does, but most - the Catholic church, for example - don't teach this aspect. Truth is not the exclusive province of any religion or philosophical thought.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								The key to finding answers is not taking anything for granted, Rose declares.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;Theology doesn't hesitate to stick an unknown factor in and then go ahead to prove a point with myths rather than reason.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;We don't believe, we search. The only way to reach truth is by avoiding untruth.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								Rose believes the only important things are mental. The body isn't important, but &quot;you can't deny the body until you transcend it. Through the body comes the energy for thought,&quot; he said.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;Physical life is like a picture show I got stuck in. I've raised three children. It's foolishness, but it's all part of the drama.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								Although Rose says each person has to make it to &quot;enlightenment&quot; (the Zen goal) on his or her own, he is willing to help them along the path. That's why he formed the Pyramid Zen Society and wrote a book, &quot;The Albigen Papers.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								There are only a few people capable of finding truth, he says, which is why the society takes the pyramid image.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;For every man who pops through (to enlightenment), there are a million who don't. We advertise (meetings) to find the few who are able to understand.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;People say we're nuts. That's nature's way of covering the pain of realizing how little one's life amounts to.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								Rose doesn't like people who sell their brands of truth. &quot;You can't price this stuff. It's not a business. Make it a business and you cheapen your product. I advise all our members to hold a job. No begging.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								Asked if his system can be used to better society, Rose replied:
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;Social betterment is the biggest joke on earth. It can't be done. It is warped people trying to straighten out other people's warps.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;For example, the hippies. Their generators are burned out with dope and they say they're going to power the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								&quot;Zen means to know yourself. I heard it as a kid a thousand times, but I never understood. With Zen, you immediately start to get your head on straight.&quot;
